<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Chaudry was born near the Rawalpindi district of <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He is the son of strong man and ex-soldier Iqbal Chaudry.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the age of 8, he moved - with his family - to <a href="Luton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luton</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, where he attended Denbigh Junior and then Beech Hill High School.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Upon first moving to England, Chaudry could not speak a word of English (only <a href="Punjabi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Punjabi</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>) and coped with being bullied by developing his fighting skills. When his father began a mini-supermarket business;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the family moved to a bigger home in <a href="Telford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Telford</a>, <a href="Shropshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shropshire</a>. Mo won a place at Wellington Grammar School; leaving with just one O-level, in English Literature.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Chaudry later attended New College, Telford, where he passed his O-levels and A levels. Following this, he graduated with a degree in sports science from (Madeley College of Physical Education) North Staffordshire Polytechnic.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After graduating, Chaudry started work for the financial services industry, as an insurance canvasser for General Portfolio.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He made his first million, as an independent financial adviser and property investor, by the age of 30.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Whilst working as a bouncer at a nightclub in Staffordshire, Chaudry met his wife Ann.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> They got married on 5 March 1987 and have three daughters (Shaheen, Josephine and Charmaine <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>). Chaudry and his wife currently live in the Staffordshire countryside.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 2008, Chaudry became the only person to have received honorary degrees from both Staffordshire universities in the same year<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> (namely <a href="Keele_University" title="wikilink">Keele University</a> and <a href="Staffordshire_University" title="wikilink">Staffordshire University</a>). Two years later, Mo was awarded the &lt;U+2018&gt;Star of Pakistan&lt;U+2019&gt;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> (the highest civil award) title at the <a href="Pakistani_Achievement_Awards" title="wikilink">Pakistani Achievement Awards</a>, which recognise individuals of Pakistani origin, for excellence and positive contributions to the image of Pakistan, who act as best example of Britishness.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Since 2010, Mo has been a Destination Staffordshire Ambassador,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> which allows him to speak to members of the press and business community on local tourism and business matters, such as the impact of tourist in Staffordshire and the benefits to the local economy. In recent years, Mo has become a campaigner against injustice. He has taken a stance against <a href="forced_marriage" title="wikilink">forced marriage</a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and successfully campaigned against the <a href="BNP" class="uri" title="wikilink">BNP</a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> to publicise their racist constitution. Mo is a former board member of the North Staffordshire Partnership<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and West Midlands Business Link,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> as well as Vice Chair of the Minority Business Association.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="port-vale-football-club">Port Vale Football Club</h3>

<p>Chaudry has long expressed an interest in becoming director of the Stoke-based Football team <a href="Port_Vale_F.C." title="wikilink">Port Vale F.C.</a> In December 2003, Port Vale F.C. went into debts of more than &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 million.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Chaudry was one of five potential buyers for the club, but <a href="Bill_Bratt" title="wikilink">Bill Bratt</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s Valiant 2001 supporters group eventually took the club out of administration.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Following Bratt&lt;U+2019&gt;s retirement from the post in 2011,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Chaudry once again applied to become the director of Port Vale; with a proposed 51% majority share<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> (an investment of approximately &lt;U+00A3&gt;5m) in the football club. His bid was backed by the majority of the shareholders, including former players, pop star Robbie Williams<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and darts legend Phil (&lt;U+2018&gt;The Power&lt;U+2019&gt;) Taylor. However, at a Port Vale EGM on 1 June 2011,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> less than the required 75% of the votes were received and, therefore, the constitution could not be changed to allow a takeover of the club.</p>
<h2 id="ventures">Ventures</h2>
<h3 id="waterworld">WaterWorld</h3>
<p>In 1999, whilst seeking a potential business investment, Chaudry bought the failing WaterWorld aqua park from Rank leisure group, for &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.5m.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Starting a major &lt;U+00A3&gt;10m refurbishment, Chaudry quickly made WaterWorld a popular attraction. He managed to make a profit in the first year<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and has continued to do so every year since. The WaterWorld complex now receives over 400,000 visitors annually<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and is regarded as the most profitable water-based visitor attraction in the U.K. In 2006, Mo unveiled plans for a &lt;U+00A3&gt;60m expansion of WaterWorld,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> aimed at increasing employment from 150 to 350; bringing a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;20 million into the region&lt;U+2019&gt;s economy<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and doubling visitor numbers. As a property investor, Chaudry&lt;U+2019&gt;s plans included the development of 230 waterside apartments, 35 mews houses, three new restaurants, a fitness centre and a hotel.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 2007, popular, U.S. owned sandwich chain. Subway, signed a 15-year lease for a 1,200 sq ft site at WaterWorld.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Subway invested &lt;U+00A3&gt;120,000 to open this &lt;U+2013&gt; the ninth &lt;U+2013&gt; Subway in the region, which created around 20 new jobs. In addition, <a href="Little_Gym" title="wikilink">Little Gym</a> and <a href="Lady_Zone" title="wikilink">Lady Zone</a> franchises<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> were attracted to the new front-of-house development.</p>
<h3 id="m-club-spa-and-fitness">M Club Spa and Fitness</h3>
<p>In April 2010, Chaudry planned to undertake a &lt;U+00A3&gt;3m refurbishment of WaterWorld; investing in two water&lt;U+2019&gt;s edge restaurants, a new beach area, a wellness centre (include beauty treatments, saunas and Jacuzzis) and an interactive play area for youngsters.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Over 12 months later &lt;U+2013&gt; in May 2011, it was announced that Esporta Health Club in Festival Park, Stoke-on-Trent, would close; leaving 2,500 club members looking for an alternative and causing the loss of over 40 local jobs.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> As a member of Esporta for 12 years, when it finally closed on Thursday 30 June 2011,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Chaudry put in a successful take-over bid for his new venture &lt;U+2013&gt; M Club Spa and Fitness. He completed the deal on 5 August 2011 and managed to re-open the club on 1 October.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Some of the facilities, at M Club Spa and Fitness, include the beauty treatments, sauna, Jacuzzi and children&lt;U+2019&gt;s play area originally planned for WaterWorld.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The name of the new club &lt;U+2013&gt; M Club Spa and Fitness &lt;U+2013&gt; was suggested by former Esporta member Ian Holdcroft<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and chosen, in an online poll, by over 150 people.</p>
<h3 id="mic-properties">MIC Properties</h3>
<p>Chaudry and his wife, Ann, are the directors of MIC Properties Ltd., which has one of the largest, privately-owned property portfolios in the West Midlands.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> MIC invests primarily in commercial property and receives rent from commercial tenants. At peak market times, MIC Properties receives a net balance sheet of 22m (circa &lt;U+00A3&gt;17m in depressed market conditions).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
