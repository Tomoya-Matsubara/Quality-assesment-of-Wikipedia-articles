It was written by <a href="Ian_Brennan_(writer)" title="wikilink">Ian Brennan</a>, directed by Carol Banker, and aired on <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> in the United States on April 19, 2011. It features the McKinley High <a href="glee_club" title="wikilink">glee club</a>, New Directions, fundraising for a fellow <a href="extracurricular_activity" title="wikilink">extracurricular activity</a> group by holding a benefit concert, while cheerleading coach <a href="Sue_Sylvester" title="wikilink">Sue Sylvester</a> (<a href="Jane_Lynch" title="wikilink">Jane Lynch</a>) attempts to thwart them.</p>
<p>Thirteen guest stars appeared in the episode, including <a href="Gwyneth_Paltrow" title="wikilink">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in her final season two appearance. Several cast members returned after extended absences: <a href="Jessalyn_Gilsig" title="wikilink">Jessalyn Gilsig</a>, <a href="Cheyenne_Jackson" title="wikilink">Cheyenne Jackson</a> and <a href="Stephen_Tobolowsky" title="wikilink">Stephen Tobolowsky</a> as members of Sue's anti-New Directions &quot;League of Doom&quot;, and <a href="Charice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charice</a> as student <a href="Sunshine_Corazon" title="wikilink">Sunshine Corazon</a>. Four songs were <a href="Cover_version" title="wikilink">covered</a> and released as singles, and a fifth featured as a dance performance.</p>
<p>Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 9.80 million American viewers, and garnered a 3.8/11 <a href="Nielsen_ratings#Ratings/share_and_total_viewers" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating/share</a> in the <a href="Nielsen_ratings#Demographics" title="wikilink">18&lt;U+2013&gt;49 demographic</a>. Critical commentary was mixed to negative. Reviewers generally disliked the storyline centered on the under-appreciation of student <a href="Mercedes_Jones" title="wikilink">Mercedes Jones</a> (<a href="Amber_Riley" title="wikilink">Amber Riley</a>), though commended her performance of <a href="Arethra_Franklin" title="wikilink">Arethra Franklin</a>'s &quot;<a href="Ain&#39;t_No_Way" title="wikilink">Ain't No Way</a>&quot;. The episode's comedy moments attracted some praise, though the guest stars and League of Doom plot were ill-received, as was the cutting short of a solo by <a href="Jenna_Ushkowitz" title="wikilink">Jenna Ushkowitz</a>, and a rendition of <a href="Adele_(singer)" title="wikilink">Adele</a>'s &quot;<a href="Turning_Tables" title="wikilink">Turning Tables</a>&quot; by Paltrow, which critics found inferior to the original.</p>

Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher <a href="Holly_Holliday" title="wikilink">Holly Holliday</a> (<a href="Gwyneth_Paltrow" title="wikilink">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy. Former McKinley student <a href="Sunshine_Corazon" title="wikilink">Sunshine Corazon</a> (<a href="Charice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charice</a>), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> followers.</p>

Tasked with breaking up Will and Holly, Dustin makes a failed attempt at seducing her. The targeted relationship begins to crumble anyway, when Will helps his former love <a href="Emma_Pillsbury" title="wikilink">Emma Pillsbury</a> (<a href="Jayma_Mays" title="wikilink">Jayma Mays</a>) with her stress-worsened <a href="OCD" class="uri" title="wikilink">OCD</a>, after she reveals that her husband <a href="Carl_Howell" title="wikilink">Carl Howell</a> (<a href="John_Stamos" title="wikilink">John Stamos</a>) has asked for an annulment.</p>
<p>Former New Directions member <a href="Kurt_Hummel" title="wikilink">Kurt Hummel</a> (<a href="Chris_Colfer" title="wikilink">Chris Colfer</a>) attends the concert, accompanied his boyfriend <a href="Blaine_Anderson" title="wikilink">Blaine Anderson</a> (<a href="Darren_Criss" title="wikilink">Darren Criss</a>).

Tina is reduced to tears by their booing; Mike does better as the hecklers are given taffy to keep their mouths full. During the intermission, Holly talks with the three students about the hidden cost of insults and suggests they cheer instead of jeer, but they opt to leave instead. Holly performs Adele's &quot;<a href="Turning_Tables" title="wikilink">Turning Tables</a>&quot; to Will. <a href="Mercedes_Jones" title="wikilink">Mercedes Jones</a> (<a href="Amber_Riley" title="wikilink">Amber Riley</a>), who has spent the lead-up to the concert making outrageous demands on her fellow club members to gain greater respect from them, performs the final number.

<p>Holly takes a job in <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, leaving Will free to pursue Emma, while Sue decides to bring Terri into the game. The episode ends on the academic decathlon final's tiebreaker question, which is in the category &quot;<a href="Wallis,_Duchess_of_Windsor" title="wikilink">hermaphrodite Nazi sympathizers</a>&quot;, a topic earlier taught in an irreverent history lesson by Holly.</p>

<p>The musical focus of the episode was, according to cast member <a href="Cory_Monteith" title="wikilink">Cory Monteith</a>, &quot;artists that may have been neglected or under-appreciated over the years&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He revealed that the series' attempt to clear <a href="music_licensing" title="wikilink">music licensing</a> rights to a song by Icelandic singer-songwriter <a href="Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk</a> was complicated by the fact that she apparently did not have a telephone number.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> She eventually declined the request, as later revealed by <em>Glee</em> creator <a href="Ryan_Murphy_(writer)" title="wikilink">Ryan Murphy</a>, because she felt the song would not have been appropriate to use in its proposed accompanying scene, but remained open to future suggestions as she mentioned that she had enjoyed the show.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The songs <a href="Cover_version" title="wikilink">covered</a> in the episode were <a href="Aretha_Franklin" title="wikilink">Aretha Franklin</a>'s &quot;<a href="Ain&#39;t_No_Way" title="wikilink">Ain't No Way</a>&quot; performed by Riley; <a href="Celine_Dion" title="wikilink">Celine Dion</a>'s cover of <a href="Eric_Carmen" title="wikilink">Eric Carmen</a>'s &quot;<a href="All_by_Myself" title="wikilink">All by Myself</a>&quot;. performed by Charice; <a href="Lykke_Li" title="wikilink">Lykke Li</a>'s &quot;<a href="I_Follow_Rivers" title="wikilink">I Follow Rivers</a>&quot;, performed by Ushkowitz; and <a href="Adele_(singer)" title="wikilink">Adele</a>'s &quot;<a href="Turning_Tables" title="wikilink">Turning Tables</a>&quot;, performed by Paltrow.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This marks the second time &quot;All by Myself&quot;, a song Charice previously performed in concert, was covered on the series, the first being in the <a href="Glee_(season_1)" title="wikilink">first season's</a> <a href="Showmance" title="wikilink">second episode</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Jack_Johnson" title="wikilink">Jack Johnson</a>'s &quot;<a href="Bubble_Toes" title="wikilink">Bubble Toes</a>&quot; also featured in the episode, as a dance routine performed by Shum, Jr.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> All four vocal performances were released as <a href="Music_download" title="wikilink">digital</a> singles,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> though only &quot;&quot;All by Myself&quot; and &quot;Turning Tables&quot; charted.

<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>
<p>&quot;A Night of Neglect&quot; received mixed to negative reviews. Erica Futterman of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> deemed it a &quot;very predictable episode&quot;, which neglected to take risks with its musical numbers and left her with a &quot;stale feeling&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Sandra Gonzalez of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> was confused by the message presented. She approved of the Will&lt;U+2013&gt;Emma plot and Holly's departure, but was dismayed by the lack of Kurt and Blaine, and criticized Mercedes' storyline for its repetitive nature.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em>{{'s}} Lisa de Moraes lambasted the League of Doom plot, which, she wrote, consisted of &quot;[two characters] whom viewers will barely remember, one who is super creepy, and another who fans despised&quot;. She suggested that they were included for contractual, rather than storyline reasons, though lauded Jackson's talent for &quot;steal[ing] every scene he's in.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Futterman also praised Jackson's &quot;long-overdue return&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>'s Lisa Respers France said the episode failed to meet her expectations. She was concerned that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted &quot;all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Amy Reiter of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> called it a &quot;quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Myles McNutt of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> graded the episode &quot;C&quot;. He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the &quot;maniacal behavior&quot; of Sue. McNutt wrote, &quot;not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not a step in the right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none.&quot; He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>'s Aly Semigran enjoyed the comedy and conclusion of Holly's plot, in what she deemed a &quot;pretty decent&quot; episode, though found Charice's appearance extraneous.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>'s Robert Canning gave &quot;A Night of Neglect&quot; 8.5/10, and called it &quot;a bright and funny installment&quot;. He too praised the comedy storylines, particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathalon scenes, as: &quot;it's this type of off-topic shenanigans (read: not about fitting in or <a href="Rachel_Berry" title="wikilink">Rachel Berry</a> becoming a star) that breathes refreshing life into <em>Glee</em> and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be.&quot; He was less impressed with the benefit concert, which he felt harmed the episode's pacing, and as with Gonzalez, found the nature of Mercedes' storyline repetitive.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="musical-performances">Musical performances</h4>
<p><img src="Jenna_Ushkowitz_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg" title="fig:The episode was criticized for, once again, cutting down a solo by Jenna Ushkowitz (pictured)." alt="The episode was criticized for, once again, cutting down a solo by Jenna Ushkowitz (pictured)." /> Musical performance in the episode, which <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>{{'s}} Emily Exton observed failed to fit the &quot;neglected&quot; criteria,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> also attracted mixed reviews. Futterman wrote that Charice &quot;pull[ed] out all the stops&quot;, with her cover of &quot;All By Myself&quot;, which reached &quot;power notes [that provided] a viable threat to Rachel and Mercedes' diva singing&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>{{'s}} Raymund Flandez commended her vocal &quot;control and efficiency belying her young age&quot;,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Semigran called it a &quot;stirring rendition&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and Gonzalez gave it an &quot;A&quot;, her joint highest grade of the episode. Her second &quot;A&quot; was awarded to &quot;Bubble Toes&quot;, which she called &quot;one of the best [performances] of the season.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Semigran concurred, &quot;[Mike's] dancing is awesome.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics disapproved of the continuing trend for cutting short Tina's solos. Gonzalez gave her rendition of &quot;I Follow Rivers&quot; a &quot;B&quot; and commented: &quot;Will Tina ever get to finish a song? Well, judging by the 20 seconds we saw, she certainly deserves to.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Futterman called her performance &quot;mostly spot-on&quot;,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and <em><a href="TVLine" class="uri" title="wikilink">TVLine</a></em>{{'s}} Michael Slezak pointed out: &quot;Why is it that every time Tina sings&lt;U+2014&gt;remember her sobbing &quot;<a href="My_Funny_Valentine" title="wikilink">My Funny Valentine</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;things end weirdly? I wish we'd gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club's underappreciated talents.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Exton suggested, &quot;Maybe she'll get a chance to do a non-comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5?&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Flandez disliked her performance; he commented that she sounded &quot;like a flailing white swan, a poor man's Bjork.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Holly's performance of &quot;Turning Tables&quot; was considered inferior to the original. Futterman named it her least-favorite of Paltrow's covers to date and said that her vocals &quot;lacked the texture that made Adele's version so heartbreaking.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of the episode, a &quot;B&lt;U+2013&gt;&quot;,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is &quot;a nice enough singer,&quot; she &quot;in no way has the chops&quot; the song requires.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> While Flandez called it a &quot;scene-stealing turn&quot; and commended it visually and vocally, he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele's veracity.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Mercedes' &quot;Ain't No Way&quot; was named the best performance of the episode by both Futterman, who enjoyed her &quot;powerhouse vocals&quot;,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and the <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em>{{'s}} Jarett Wieselman, who called it &quot;unbelievable&quot;, and praised the focus placed on Mercedes following a season which failed to showcase her.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Flandez described the number as being &quot;glamorously sung like [the] star she is&quot;, and hoped that she would be better used in future.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In contrast, Reiter called it &quot;a restrained rendition&quot;, but &quot;prettily sung nonetheless&quot;,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> and Gonzalez struggled to connect with the &quot;uncharacteristically average&quot; song, though noted that for Mercedes that is &quot;still 10 times better than a normal person&quot; and awarded it a &quot;B+&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
