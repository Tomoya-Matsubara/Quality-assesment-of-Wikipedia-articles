<p>Reluctant to give up the very addictive energy drink <a href="Red_Bull" title="wikilink">Red Bull</a>, <a href="Peter_Griffin" title="wikilink">Peter</a> decides to make his own beverage out of <a href="kerosene" class="uri" title="wikilink">kerosene</a>. He collapses from kidney failure, and is told he needs a new kidney. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment, causing him to become <a href="jaundice" title="wikilink">jaundiced</a> and <a href="Hematemesis" title="wikilink">vomit blood</a>. At the hospital, his wife, <a href="Lois_Griffin" title="wikilink">Lois</a> volunteers to give up her kidney, but is informed that she is not a match. Peter's dog, <a href="Brian_Griffin" title="wikilink">Brian</a> also volunteers, and it is discovered that he has the same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are weaker than human kidneys, the donation requires both kidneys, and thus Brian's death, in order for the procedure to be a success. Brian decides go along with the procedure in order to save Peter's life. Reluctant to let Brian leave him, Stewie decides to kidnap Brian, and take him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, the family's doctor, Dr. Hartman, reveals that he is also a match, and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, United States President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> has decided to visit <a href="Family_Guy#Setting" title="wikilink">Quahog</a>, and <a href="Chris_Griffin" title="wikilink">Chris'</a> entire English class is assigned to write an essay about hope. He asks his sister, <a href="Meg_Griffin" title="wikilink">Meg</a>, for her opinion, and she begins listing her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris <a href="plagiarism" title="wikilink">plagiarizes</a>. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.</p>
