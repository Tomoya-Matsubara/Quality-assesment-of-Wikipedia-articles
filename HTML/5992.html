<p>The <strong>Oklahoma City bombing</strong> was a bomb attack on the <a href="Alfred_P._Murrah_Federal_Building" title="wikilink">Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building</a> in <a href="downtown_Oklahoma_City" title="wikilink">downtown Oklahoma City</a> on April 19, 1995. It was the most destructive act of terrorism on American soil until the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. The Oklahoma blast claimed 168 lives, including 19 children under the age of 6,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and injured more than 680 people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a sixteen-block radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The bomb was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The <a href="Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" title="wikilink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) activated eleven of its <a href="FEMA_Urban_Search_and_Rescue_Task_Force" title="wikilink">Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces</a>, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Within 90 minutes of the explosion, <a href="Timothy_McVeigh" title="wikilink">Timothy McVeigh</a> was stopped by <a href="Oklahoma_Highway_Patrol" title="wikilink">Oklahoma State Trooper</a> Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and <a href="Terry_Nichols" title="wikilink">Terry Nichols</a> to the attack; Nichols was arrested,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and within days both were charged. <a href="Michael_and_Lori_Fortier" title="wikilink">Michael and Lori Fortier</a> were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, an American <a href="militia_movement" title="wikilink">militia movement</a> sympathizer, had detonated an explosive-filled truck parked in front of the building. McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had assisted in the bomb preparation. Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived as its mishandling of the <a href="Waco_Siege" title="wikilink">Waco Siege</a> (1993) and the <a href="Ruby_Ridge" title="wikilink">Ruby Ridge</a> incident (1992), McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at Waco.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The official investigation, known as &quot;OKBOMB&quot;, was the largest criminal investigation case in American history; FBI agents conducted 28,000 interviews, amassing  of evidence, and collected nearly one billion pieces of information.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by <a href="lethal_injection" title="wikilink">lethal injection</a> on June 11, 2001, and Nichols was sentenced to <a href="Life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life in prison</a>. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was sentenced to twelve years in prison for failing to warn the U.S. government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony. As with other large-scale terrorist attacks, conspiracy theories dispute the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators.</p>
<p>As a result of the bombing, the U.S. government passed <a href="United_States_federal_building_security" title="wikilink">legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings</a> to deter future terrorist attacks. From 1995 to 2005, over 60 domestic terrorism plots were foiled due to preventive measures taken in response to the bombing.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On April 19, 2000, the <a href="Oklahoma_City_National_Memorial" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City National Memorial</a> was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the original explosion occurred.</p>

Murrah Federal Building as it appeared before its destruction" width="150" /> McVeigh initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law-enforcement agencies: the <a href="Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives" title="wikilink">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> (ATF), the <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), or the <a href="Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="wikilink">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA).

<p>McVeigh, a resident of <a href="Kingman,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Kingman, Arizona</a>, considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> McVeigh stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize nongovernmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in <a href="Little_Rock,_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect their target: the Alfred P.

<h3 id="gathering-materials">Gathering materials</h3>

<p>McVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb, which they stored in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine <a href="binary_explosive" title="wikilink">Kinestiks</a> from gun collector Roger E. Moore, and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols' home in <a href="Herington,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Herington, Kansas</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty  bags of <a href="ammonium_nitrate" title="wikilink">ammonium nitrate</a> from Mid-Kansas Coop in <a href="McPherson,_Kansas" title="wikilink">McPherson, Kansas</a>, an amount regarded as unusual even for a farmer. Nichols bought an additional  bag on October 18, 1994.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>They allegedly robbed gun collector Roger E. Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's own van.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> McVeigh had previously visited Moore's ranch. However, doubts have been raised about Nichols and McVeigh's involvement in the robbery for several reasons. The robbers wore ski masks (making a positive identification impossible), and the physical description given did not match Nichols.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Also, <a href="Aryan_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Aryan Republican Army</a> robbers were operating in the area of Moore's ranch at the time.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Moreover, McVeigh did not need to raise money for the bomb, which only cost about $5,000. In all, the truck rental cost about $250, the fertilizer less than $500, and the <a href="nitromethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitromethane</a> $2,780, with a cheap car being used as a getaway vehicle.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> McVeigh wrote a letter to Moore in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Despite these doubts, items that were stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols' home and in a storage shed that he had rented.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, mixed with about  of liquid nitromethane and  of <a href="Tovex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tovex</a>. Including the weight of the sixteen <a href="55_gallon_drum" title="wikilink">55-U.S.-gallon drums</a> in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about .<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> McVeigh had originally intended to use <a href="hydrazine" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrazine</a> rocket fuel, but it proved to be too expensive.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In October 1994, posing as a motorcycle racer, McVeigh obtained three  drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>McVeigh rented a storage space, in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18-inch-long Tovex sausages, 80 spools of <a href="Shock_tube_detonator" title="wikilink">shock tube</a>, and 500 electric <a href="blasting_cap" title="wikilink">blasting caps</a>, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in <a href="Marion,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Marion, Kansas</a>. He decided not to steal any of the  of <a href="ANFO" class="uri" title="wikilink">ANFO</a> he found at the scene, as he did not believe it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic <a href="Gatorade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gatorade</a> jug containing ammonium nitrate <a href="prill" title="wikilink">prills</a>, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a blasting cap.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, &quot;You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.&quot; He compared his actions to the <a href="atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, rather than the <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in <a href="Junction_City,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Junction City, Kansas</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The following day he rented a <a href="Ryder" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ryder</a> truck under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the <a href="Klingon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Klingon</a> warriors of <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On April 16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' pickup truck as it drove to the federal building.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the <a href="Vehicle_Identification_Number" title="wikilink">Vehicle Identification Number</a> (VIN) plate that read, &quot;Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery &amp; cable).&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Both men then returned to Kansas.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-bomb">Building the bomb</h3>
<p>On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed their supplies from their storage unit in <a href="Herington,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Herington, Kansas</a>, where Nichols lived. They loaded 108 bags of high-grade <a href="ammonium_nitrate" title="wikilink">ammonium nitrate</a> <a href="fertilizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">fertilizer</a> weighing  each, three  drums of liquid <a href="nitromethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitromethane</a>, several crates of explosive <a href="Tovex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tovex</a>, seventeen bags of <a href="ANFO" class="uri" title="wikilink">ANFO</a>, and spools of <a href="Shock_tube_detonator" title="wikilink">shock tube</a> and <a href="cannon_fuse" title="wikilink">cannon fuse</a> into a Ryder rental truck.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The two then drove to Geary County State Lake, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the thirteen barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Each filled barrel weighed nearly .<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his <a href="Glock_21" title="wikilink">Glock 21</a> pistol in case the primary fuses failed.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a <a href="shaped_charge" title="wikilink">shaped charge</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This was achieved by <a href="wiktionary:tamp" title="wikilink">tamping</a> the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he said later that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed  load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab of the truck, through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit, to two sets of non-electric blasting caps.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the <a href="truck" class="uri" title="wikilink">truck</a>'s <a href="livery" class="uri" title="wikilink">livery</a>, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make them harder to disable by yanking from the outside.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the  of Tovex Blastrite Gel &quot;sausages&quot;, which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the thirteen filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about  of diesel fuel.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> After finishing the truck bomb, the two men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.</p>

<p>Initially, the FBI had three hypotheses regarding who might have been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the <a href="1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing" title="wikilink">World Trade Center bombing</a> two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a <a href="drug_cartel" title="wikilink">drug cartel</a> might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents, as the building held a DEA office.

<h3 id="timothy-mcveigh">Timothy McVeigh</h3>

<p>Opening arguments in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading <em><a href="The_Turner_Diaries" title="wikilink">The Turner Diaries</a></em>. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the <a href="Brady_Bill" title="wikilink">Brady Bill</a>, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> The prosecution called 137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
<p>McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a &quot;necessity defense&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;which would argue that he was in &quot;imminent danger&quot; from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents).<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> McVeigh argued that &quot;imminent&quot; does not mean &quot;immediate&quot;: &quot;If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat.&quot;<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as &quot;the designated patsy&quot;.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> However McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> Jones presented 25 witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. <a href="Frederic_Whitehurst" title="wikilink">Frederic Whitehurst</a>. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>
<p>A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> A <a href="gag_order" title="wikilink">gag order</a> was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>
<p>The jury deliberated for 23 hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on eleven counts of murder and conspiracy.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a><a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> In May 2001, the FBI announced that it had withheld over 3,000 documents from McVeigh's defense counsel.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> The execution was postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents.

<p>Nichols stood trial twice.

<h3 id="michael-fortier">Michael Fortier</h3>

<p>Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelve years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> On January 20, 2006, after serving ten and a half years of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the <a href="United_States_Federal_Witness_Protection_Program" title="wikilink">Witness Protection Program</a> and given a new identity.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
<p>No &quot;John Doe #2&quot; was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W.

<p>The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> In June 1995, the GSA issued <em>Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities</em>, also known as <em>The Marshals Report</em>, the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum).<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a><a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
<p>The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The <a href="National_Geographic_Channel" title="wikilink">National Geographic Channel</a> documentary series <em><a href="Seconds_From_Disaster" title="wikilink">Seconds From Disaster</a></em> suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="discussion-of-the-nature-of-dissent">Discussion of the nature of dissent</h3>
<p>Even many who agreed with some of McVeigh's politics viewed his act as counterproductive, with much of the criticism focused on the deaths of innocent children; critics expressed chagrin that McVeigh had not assassinated specific government leaders. McVeigh had indeed contemplated the assassinations of Attorney General <a href="Janet_Reno" title="wikilink">Janet Reno</a>, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building,<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of <a href="Gore_Vidal" title="wikilink">Gore Vidal</a>'s essay <em>The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh</em>.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a><a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> Other journalists compared him to <a href="John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="wikilink">John Brown</a>.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
<p>McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the <a href="Montana_Freemen" title="wikilink">Montana Freemen</a> standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1 million settlement with <a href="Randy_Weaver" title="wikilink">Randy Weaver</a> and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, &quot;Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around.&quot;<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a></p>

<p>For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a><a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996,<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624 submissions.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> The memorial was designed at a cost of $29 million, which was raised by public and private funds.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a><a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a> The memorial is part of the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a><a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> Within the first year, it had 700,000 visitors.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a></p>
<p>The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs&lt;U+2014&gt;one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the &quot;survivor tree&quot;, part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> North of the memorial is the <a href="India_Temple_Shrine_Building" title="wikilink">Journal Record Building</a>, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service.
