<p><strong>European integration</strong> is the process of political, legal, <a href="economic_integration" title="wikilink">economic</a> (and in some cases social and cultural) <a href="Regional_integration" title="wikilink">integration</a> of states wholly or partially in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. In the present day, European integration has primarily come about through the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> and the <a href="Council_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Council of Europe</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>One of the first to conceive of a union of European nations was <a href="Count_Richard_Nikolaus_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi" title="wikilink">Count Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi</a>, who wrote the <a href="Count_Richard_Nikolaus_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi#European_union" title="wikilink">Pan-Europa manifesto</a> in 1923.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His ideas influenced <a href="Aristide_Briand" title="wikilink">Aristide Briand</a>, who gave a speech in favor of a European Union in the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> on 8 September 1929, and in 1930, who wrote his &quot;Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union&quot; for the Government of France,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> becoming the first European government formally to adopt the principle.</p>

<p>At the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the continental political climate favoured unity in Western Europe, seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of <a href="nationalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">nationalism</a> which had devastated the continent.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the <a href="University_of_Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich" title="wikilink">University of Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>, <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> postulated a <a href="United_States_of_Europe" title="wikilink">United States of Europe</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The same speech however contains remarks, less often quoted, which make it clear that Churchill did not see Britain as being part of this United States of Europe: <em>We British have our own Commonwealth of Nations ... And why should there not be a European group which could give a sense of enlarged patriotism and common citizenship to the distracted peoples of this turbulent and mighty continent and why should it not take its rightful place with other great groupings in shaping the destinies of men?</em> ... <em>France and Germany must take the lead together. Great Britain, the British Commonwealth of Nations, mighty America and I trust Soviet Russia-for then indeed all would be well-must be the friends and sponsors of the new Europe and must champion its right to live and shine.</em></p>
<h2 id="council-of-europe">Council of Europe</h2>
<p>Against the background of the devastation and human suffering during the second World War as well as the need for reconciliation after the war, the idea of European integration led to the creation of the <a href="Council_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Council of Europe</a> in <a href="Strasbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strasbourg</a> in 1949. <img src="CouncilOfEurope.PNG" title="fig:Council of Europe" alt="Council of Europe" width="650" /> The most important achievement of the Council of Europe is the <a href="European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Convention on Human Rights</a> of 1950 with its <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a> in Strasbourg, which serves as a <em>de facto</em> supreme court for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout Europe. Human rights are also protected by the Council of Europe's <a href="Committee_for_the_Prevention_of_Torture" title="wikilink">Committee for the Prevention of Torture</a> and the <a href="European_Social_Charter" title="wikilink">European Social Charter</a>.</p>
<p>Most conventions of the Council of Europe pursue the aim of greater legal integration, such as the conventions on legal assistance, against corruption, against money laundering, against doping in sport, or internet crime.</p>
<p>Cultural co-operation is based on the <a href="Hague_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Cultural_Property_in_the_Event_of_Armed_Conflict" title="wikilink">Cultural Convention of 1954</a> and subsequent conventions on the recognition of university studies and diplomas as well as on the protection of minority languages.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, former communist countries in central and eastern Europe were able to accede to the Council of Europe, which now comprises 47 states in Europe with the exception of <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a> due to its still non-democratic government. Therefore, European integration has practically succeeded at the level of the Council of Europe, encompassing the whole European continent.</p>
<p>European integration at the level of the Council of Europe functions through the accession of member states to its conventions as well as through political coordination at the level of ministerial conferences and inter-parliamentary sessions. In accordance with its Statute of 1949, the Council of Europe works to achieve greater unity among its members based on common values, such as <a href="human_rights" title="wikilink">human rights</a> and <a href="democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">democracy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="organization-for-security-and-co-operation-in-europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</h2>
<p><img src="OSCEcountries.PNG" title="fig:OSCE" alt="OSCE" width="600" /> The <a href="Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) is a trans-Atlantic <a href="intergovernmental_organization" title="wikilink">intergovernmental organisation</a> whose aim is to secure stability in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. It was established as the <a href="Conference_on_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (CSCE) in July 1973, and was subsequently transformed into its current form in January 1995. The OSCE currently has 56 member states, covering most of the <a href="northern_hemisphere" title="wikilink">northern hemisphere</a>.</p>
<p>The OSCE develops 3 lines of activities, namely the <em>Politico-Military Dimension</em>, the <em>Economic and Environmental Dimension</em> and the <em>Human Dimension</em>. These respectively promote (i) mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution; (ii) the monitoring, alerting and assistance in case of economic and environmental threats; and (iii) full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<h2 id="regional-integration">Regional integration</h2>
<p>Several <a href="Regional_integration" title="wikilink">Regional integration</a> efforts have effectively promoted intergovernmental cooperation and reduced the possibility of regional armed conflict. Other initiatives have removed barriers to free trade in European regions, and increased the free movement of people, labour, goods, and capital across national borders.</p>
<h3 id="baltic-region">Baltic region</h3>
<p>The following political and/or economic organisations have been created in the <a href="Baltic_region" title="wikilink">Baltic region</a> in the <a href="postmodernity" title="wikilink">post-modern era</a>:</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Baltic_Assembly" title="wikilink">Baltic Assembly</a></strong> aims to promote co-operation between the parliaments of the <a href="Baltic_states" title="wikilink">Baltic states</a>, namely the Republics of <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a> and <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a>. The organisation was planned in <a href="Vilnius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vilnius</a> on 1 December 1990, and the three nations agreed to its structure and rules on 13 June 1994.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Baltic_Free_Trade_Area" title="wikilink">Baltic Free Trade Area</a></strong> (BAFTA) was a trade agreement between <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>. It was signed on 13 September 1993 and came into force on 1 April 1994. The agreement was later extended to apply also to agricultural products, effective from 1 January 1997. BAFTA ceased to exist when its members joined the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Council_of_the_Baltic_Sea_States" title="wikilink">Council of the Baltic Sea States</a></strong> (CBSS) was founded in 1992 to promote intergovernmental cooperation among <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a> countries in questions concerning economy, civil society development, human rights issues, and nuclear and radiation safety. It has 12 members including <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> (since 1995), <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a> and the <a href="European_Commission" title="wikilink">European Commission</a>.</p>
<h3 id="low-countries-region">Low Countries region</h3>
<p>Since the end of the First World War the following unions have been set in the <a href="Low_Countries" title="wikilink">Low Countries</a> region:</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Benelux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benelux</a></strong> is an economic and political union between <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>. On September 5, 1944, a treaty establishing the <strong><a href="Benelux_Customs_Union" title="wikilink">Benelux Customs Union</a></strong> was signed. It entered into force in 1948, and ceased to exist on November 1, 1960, when it was replaced by the <strong><a href="Benelux_Economic_Union" title="wikilink">Benelux Economic Union</a></strong> after a treaty signed in The Hague on February 3, 1958. A <a href="Benelux_Parliament" title="wikilink">Benelux Parliament</a> was created in 1955.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Belgium-Luxembourg_Economic_Union" title="wikilink">Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union</a></strong> (BLEU) can be seen as the Benelux forerunner. BLEU was created by the treaty signed on 25 July 1921. It established a <a href="single_market" title="wikilink">single market</a> between both countries, while setting the <a href="Belgian_franc" title="wikilink">Belgian franc</a> and <a href="Luxembourgian_franc" title="wikilink">Luxembourgian franc</a> at a fixed parity.</p>
<h3 id="black-sea-region">Black Sea region</h3>
<p>Several regional organisations have been founded in the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> region since the fall of the Soviet Union, such as:</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Organization_of_the_Black_Sea_Economic_Cooperation" title="wikilink">Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation</a></strong> (BSEC) aims to ensure peace, stability and prosperity by encouraging friendly and good-neighbourly relations among the 12 state members, located mainly in the Black Sea region. It was created on 25 June 1992 in Istanbul, and entered into force on 1 May 1999. The 11 founding members were <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a>, <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, <a href="Moldova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moldova</a>, <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>, and <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>. <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> (then Serbia and Montenegro) joined in April 2004.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development" title="wikilink">GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development</a></strong> is a regional organization of four post-Soviet states, which aims to promote cooperation and democratic values, ensure stable development, enhance international and regional security, and stepping up European integration. Current members include the four founding ones, namely, <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>, and <a href="Moldova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moldova</a>. <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a> joined in 1999, and left in 2005.</p>
<h3 id="british-isles">British Isles</h3>
<p>Since the end of the First World War, the following agreements have been signed in the <a href="British_Isles" title="wikilink">British Isles</a> region:</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="British-Irish_Council" title="wikilink">British-Irish Council</a></strong> was created by the <a href="Belfast_Agreement" title="wikilink">Belfast Agreement</a> in 1998 to <em>&quot;promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands&quot;</em>. It was formally established on 2 December 1999. Its membership comprises <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, three of the <a href="constituent_countries" title="wikilink">constituent countries</a> of the UK (<a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>), and three <a href="Monarch_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="Crown_dependencies" title="wikilink">Crown dependencies</a> (<a href="Guernsey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guernsey</a>, the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a> and <a href="Jersey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jersey</a>). Because <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> does not have a <a href="devolution" title="wikilink">devolved government</a>, it is not represented on the Council as a separate entity.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Common_Travel_Area" title="wikilink">Common Travel Area</a></strong> is a passport-free zone established in 1922 that comprises the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a>, the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a>, <a href="Jersey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jersey</a> and <a href="Guernsey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guernsey</a>.</p>
<h3 id="central-europe">Central Europe</h3>

Czechoslovakia had in the meantime split into the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a>. <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a> joined in 1996, while <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> did the same in 1997, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> in 1999, and <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> in 2003. In 2004, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia left the CEFTA to join the EU. Romania and Bulgaria left it in 2007 for the same reason. Subsequently, Macedonia joined it in 2006, and Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and <a href="UNMIK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNMIK</a> (on behalf of Kosovo) in 2007.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Visegrad_Group" title="wikilink">Visegrad Group</a></strong> is a Central-European alliance for cooperation and European integration. The Group originated in a summit meeting of <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> and <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> held in the Hungarian castle town of <a href="Visegr&lt;U+00E1&gt;d" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visegr&lt;U+00E1&gt;d</a> on 15 February 1991.

<h3 id="nordic-region">Nordic region</h3>
<p>Since the end of the Second World War, the following organisations have been established in the <a href="Nordic_region" title="wikilink">Nordic region</a>:</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="Nordic_Council" title="wikilink">Nordic Council</a></strong> and the Nordic Council of Ministers is a co-operation forum for the parliaments and governments of the <a href="Nordic_countries" title="wikilink">Nordic countries</a> created in February 1953.

<h2 id="european-free-trade-association">European Free Trade Association</h2>
<p>The <a href="European_Free_Trade_Association" title="wikilink">European Free Trade Association</a> (EFTA) is a European <a href="trade_bloc" title="wikilink">trade bloc</a> which was established on May 3, 1960 as an alternative for European states who didn't join the <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">EEC</a>. EFTA currently has four member states: <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="Liechtenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liechtenstein</a>; just Norway and Switzerland are founding members.</p>
<p>The EFTA Convention was signed on January 4, 1960 in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a> by 7 states: <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a> became an associate member in 1961 and a full member in 1986; <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> joined in 1970 and <a href="Liechtenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liechtenstein</a> did the same in 1991.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Denmark left in 1973, when they joined the <a href="European_Community" title="wikilink">European Community</a> (EC). Portugal left EFTA in 1986, when it also joined the EC. Austria, Finland and Sweden ceased to be EFTA members in 1995 by joining the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>, which superseded the EC in 1993.</p>
<h2 id="commonwealth-of-independent-states">Commonwealth of Independent States</h2>

<p><img src="EU_CIS.PNG" title="fig:European Union and Commonwealth of Independent States" alt="European Union and Commonwealth of Independent States" width="600" /> The <a href="Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS) is a loose organization in which most former Soviet republics participate, a visa-free regime operates among members and a free-trade area is planned for the beginning of 2011. Ukraine is not an official member, but does participate in the organization.</p>
<h2 id="european-communities">European Communities</h2>
<p>In 1951, a few Western European states agreed to confer powers over their steel and coal production to the <strong><a href="European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="wikilink">European Coal and Steel Community</a></strong> (ECSC) in the <strong><a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1951)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Paris</a></strong>, which came into force on 23 July 1952.</p>
<p>Coal and steel production was essential for the reconstruction of countries in Europe after the second World War and this sector of the national economy had been important for warfare in the first and second World Wars. Therefore, France had originally maintained its occupation of the <a href="Saarland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saarland</a> with its steel companies after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in 1949. By transferring national powers over the coal and steel production to a newly created ECSC Commission, the member states of the ECSC were able to provide for greater transparency and trust among themselves.</p>
<p>This transfer of national powers to a &quot;Community&quot; to be exercised by its Commission was paralled under the 1957 <strong><a href="Treaty_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Treaty of Rome</a></strong> establishing the <strong><a href="European_Atomic_Energy_Community" title="wikilink">European Atomic Energy Community</a></strong> (or Euroatom) and the <strong><a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">European Economic Community</a></strong> (EEC) in Brussels.</p>
<p>In 1967, the <a href="Merger_Treaty" title="wikilink">Merger Treaty</a> (or <strong>Brussels Treaty</strong>) combine the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC. They already shared a <a href="European_Parliament" title="wikilink">Parliamentary Assembly</a> and <a href="European_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Courts</a>. Collectively they were known as the <a href="European_Communities" title="wikilink">European Communities</a>. In 1987, the <strong><a href="Single_European_Act" title="wikilink">Single European Act</a></strong> (SEA) was the first major revision of the Treaty of Rome that formally established the single European market and the European Political Cooperation. The Communities originally had independent personalities although they were increasingly integrated, and over the years were transformed into what is now called the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>.</p>
<p>The six states that founded the three Communities were known as the &quot;<a href="inner_six" title="wikilink">inner six</a>&quot; (the &quot;outer seven&quot; were those countries who formed the <a href="European_Free_Trade_Association" title="wikilink">European Free Trade Association</a>). These were <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="West_Germany" title="wikilink">West Germany</a>. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> joined in 1981, and <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a> and <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> did the same in 1986. On 3 October 1990 East Germany and West Germany were reunified, hence East Germany became part of the Community in the new reunified Germany (not increasing the number of states).</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a></strong> (<strong>EU</strong>) is an association of twenty-seven sovereign <a href="European_Union_member_state" title="wikilink">member states</a>, that by treaty have delegated certain of their competences to common institutions, in order to coordinate their policies in a number of areas, without however constituting a new state on top of the member states. Officially established by the <a href="Treaty_of_Maastricht" title="wikilink">Treaty of Maastricht</a> in 1993 upon the foundations of the pre-existing <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">European Economic Community</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, 12 states are founding members, namely, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. In 1995, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a> and <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a> entered the EU. <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a>, the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>, <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Malta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malta</a>, <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a>, and <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a> joined in 2004. Finally, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> gained access in 2007. Official candidate states include <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>, <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>, <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. Applications have been submitted by <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a> and <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>. <a href="Morocco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morocco</a>'s application was rejected by the EEC and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>'s is frozen. <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> rejected membership in two referendums.</p>
<p>The institutions of the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>, its parliamentarians, judges, commissioners and secretariat, the governments of its member states as well as their people, all play a role in European Integration. Nevertheless, the question of who plays the key role is disputed as there are different theories on European Integration focusing on different actors and agency.</p>
<p>The European Union has a number of relationships with nations that are not formally part of the Union. According to the European Union's official site, and a statement by Commissioner G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nter Verheugen, the aim is to have a ring of countries, sharing EU's democratic ideals and joining them in further integration without necessarily becoming full member states.</p>
<h3 id="competences">Competences</h3>

<p>Whilst most responsibilities ('competences') are retained by the member states, some competences are conferred exclusively on the Union for collective decision, some are shared pending Union action and some receive Union support. hese are shown are shown on this table: </p>

Further, the EU has a number of economic relationships with nations that are not formally part of the Union through the <a href="European_Economic_Area" title="wikilink">European Economic Area</a> and custom union agreements.</p>
<h4 id="free-trade-area">Free Trade Area</h4>
<p><img src="EU_free_trade_agreements.PNG" title="fig:EU Free trade agreements" alt="EU Free trade agreements" width="400" /> The creation of the EEC eliminated tariffs, quotas and preferences on goods among member states, which are the requisites to define a <a href="Free_Trade_Area" title="wikilink">Free Trade Area</a> (FTA).</p>
<p>Numerous countries have signed a <a href="European_Union_Association_Agreement" title="wikilink">European Union Association Agreement</a> (AA) with FTA provisions. These mainly include Mediterranean countries (<a href="Algeria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algeria</a> in 2005, <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> in 2004, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> in 2000, <a href="Jordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordan</a> in 2002, <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> in 2006, <a href="Morocco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morocco</a> in 2000, <a href="Palestinian_National_Authority" title="wikilink">Palestinian National Authority</a> in 1997, and <a href="Tunisia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a> in 1998), albeit some countries from other trade blocs have also signed one (such as <a href="Chile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chile</a> in 2003, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> in 2000, and <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> in 2000).</p>
<p>Further, many Balkan states have signed a <strong><a href="Stabilisation_and_Association_Process" title="wikilink">Stabilisation and Association Agreement</a></strong> (SAA) with FTA provisions (such as <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a> (signed 2006), <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> (2005), <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> (2007), <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a> (2004), <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> (both 2008, entry-into-force pending).</p>

<h4 id="customs-union">Customs Union</h4>
<p>The <a href="European_Union_Customs_Union" title="wikilink">European Customs Union</a> defines an area where no <a href="customs" class="uri" title="wikilink">customs</a> are levied on goods travelling within it. It includes all <a href="European_Union_member_states" title="wikilink">European Union member states</a>. The abolition of internal tariff barriers between <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">EEC</a> member states was achieved in 1968.</p>
<p><a href="Andorra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andorra</a> and <a href="San_Marino" title="wikilink">San Marino</a> belong to the EU customs unions with third states.

<h4 id="single-market">Single Market</h4>
<p>A prominent goal of the EU since its creation by the <a href="Maastricht_Treaty" title="wikilink">Maastricht Treaty</a> in 1992 is establishing and maintaining a <a href="single_market" title="wikilink">single market</a>. This seeks to guarantee the <a href="Four_Freedoms_(European_Union)" title="wikilink">four basic freedoms</a>, which are related to ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital and people around the EU's internal market.</p>
<p>The <strong>European Economic Area</strong> (EEA) agreement allows <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> and <a href="Liechtenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liechtenstein</a> to participate in the European Single Market without joining the EU. The four basic freedoms apply. However, some restrictions on fisheries and agriculture take place. <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> is linked to the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> by <a href="Switzerland_and_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">Swiss-EU bilateral agreements</a>, with a different content from that of the EEA agreement.</p>

<p>The <a href="Eurozone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurozone</a> refers to the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> member states that have adopted the <a href="euro" class="uri" title="wikilink">euro</a> <a href="currency_union" title="wikilink">currency union</a> as the third stage of the <a href="Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">European Economic and Monetary Union</a> (EMU). Further, certain states outside the EU have adopted the euro as their currency, despite not belonging to the EMU. Thus, a total of 23 states, including 17 <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> states and six non-EU members, currently use the euro.</p>
<p>The Eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro on 1 January 1999. Physical <a href="Euro_coins" title="wikilink">coins</a> and <a href="Euro_banknotes" title="wikilink">banknotes</a> were introduced on 1 January 2002.</p>

<p>There has long been speculation about the possibility of the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> eventually becoming a <a href="fiscal_union" title="wikilink">fiscal union</a>. In the wake of the <a href="2010_European_sovereign_debt_crisis" title="wikilink">European sovereign debt crisis</a>, calls for closer fiscal ties, possibly leading to some sort of fiscal union have increased; though it is generally regarded as implausible in the short term, some analysts regard fiscal union as a long-term necessity.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> While stressing the need for coordination, governments have rejected talk of fiscal union or harmonization.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Further, <a href="Monaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monaco</a>, <a href="San_Marino" title="wikilink">San Marino</a> and <a href="Vatican_City" title="wikilink">Vatican City</a> are <em>de-facto</em> members.</p>

<p><img src="NATO_CSTO.PNG" title="fig:NATO/CSTO" alt="NATO/CSTO" width="600" /> The <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> is not a <a href="Sovereign_state" title="wikilink">state</a> and as such does not have its own dedicated military forces. However, there are a number of multi-national military and peacekeeping forces which are ultimately under the command of the EU, and therefore can be seen as the core for a future European Union army.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> These corps include forces from 25 EU states -all except <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, which has an opt-out clause in its accession treaty and is not obliged to participate in the common defence policy; and Malta, which currently does not participate in any battlegroup-, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. Further, the <a href="WEU" title="wikilink"><strong>Western European Union</strong></a> (WEU) capabilities and functions have been transferred to the European Union, under its developing <a href="Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="wikilink">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a> (CFSP) and <a href="European_Security_and_Defence_Policy" title="wikilink">European Security and Defence Policy</a> (ESDP).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> also has close ties with the <strong><a href="NATO" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a></strong> (NATO), according to the <a href="Berlin_Plus_agreement" title="wikilink">Berlin Plus agreement</a>. This is a comprehensive package of agreements made between NATO and the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> on 16 December 2002. With this agreement the <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> is given the possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO does not want to act itself &lt;U+2013&gt; the so-called &quot;right of first refusal&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In fact, many EU member states are among the 28 NATO members. The <a href="Treaty_of_Brussels" title="wikilink">Treaty of Brussels</a> is considered the precursor to NATO. The <a href="North_Atlantic_Treaty" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Treaty</a> was signed in Washington, D.C. in 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states, as well as the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> and <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>. <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> joined the alliance in 1952, and <a href="West_Germany" title="wikilink">West Germany</a> did the same in 1955. <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> entered in 1982. In 1999, <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>, the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a>, and <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> became NATO members. Finally, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>, <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>, and <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a> joined in 2004. In 2009, <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> and <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a> joined. <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> were told that they will also eventually become members in 2008. The <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Republic of Macedonia</a>'s application process is finished, but it is blocked by Greece. Thus, 21 out of 28 NATO states are among the 27 EU members, another two are members of the EEA, and two more are EU candidates (one of those is member of the EU customs space).</p>
<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p><img src="Location_ESA_member_countries.svg" title="fig:" alt="" width="300" /> On 22 May 2007, the member states of the European Union have agreed to create a common political framework for space activities in Europe by unifying the approach of the <strong><a href="European_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">European Space Agency</a></strong> (ESA) with those of the individual European Union member states.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>However, ESA is an intergovernmental organisation with no formal organic link to the EU; indeed the two institutions have different member states and are governed by different rules and procedures. ESA was created in 1975 by the merger of the two pre-existing European organisations engaged in space activities, <a href="ELDO" class="uri" title="wikilink">ELDO</a> and <a href="ESRO" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESRO</a>. The 10 founding members were <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. The <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> joined on 31 December 1975. In 1987, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> and <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> became member states. <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a> joined in 1995, <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a> in 2000, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a> in 2005, and the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a> in 2008. Currently, it has 18 member states: all the EU member states before 2004, plus Czech Republic, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> has had the special status of a Cooperating State under a series of cooperation agreements dating since 1979.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The political perspective of the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> is to make ESA an <a href="Agency_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">agency of the EU</a> by 2014.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> ESA is likely to expand in the coming years with the countries which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007. Currently, almost all EU member states are in different stages of affiliation with ESA. <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> signed the Accession Agreement to the ESA Convention on 20 January 2011 and will become the 19th member of ESA once it deposits its instrument of ratification with the government of France. This is due to happen later in 2011.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>, <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> have started to implement a Plan for European Cooperating State (PECS) Charter. <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> has signed a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> have signed Cooperation Agreements with ESA.

<p><img src="EU-Agreements-2011-06-03.svg" title="fig:             " alt="             " width="320" /> <img src="EU_and_NATO.svg" title="fig:Map showing European membership of the EU and NATO   " alt="Map showing European membership of the EU and NATO   " /> <img src="ESA_and_EU.png" title="fig:" alt="" width="200" /></p>
<p>A small group of <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> member states have joined all European treaties, instead of opting out on some. They drive the development of a federal model for the European integration. This is linked to the concept of <a href="Multi-speed_Europe" title="wikilink">Multi-speed Europe</a> where some countries would create a core union; and goes back to the <a href="Inner_Six" title="wikilink">Inner Six</a> references to the founding member states of the <a href="European_Communities" title="wikilink">European Communities</a>.</p>
<p>At present the formation of a formal Core Europe Federation (&quot;a federation within the confederation&quot;) had been held off at every occasion that such a federation treaty had been discussed. Instead supranational institutions are created that govern more areas in &quot;Inner Europe&quot; than the existing European integration provides for.</p>
<p>Among the 27 EU state members, eleven states have signed all integration agreements. These are <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>, the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, and <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>The agreements considered include the fifth stage of economic integration or <a href="Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">EMU</a>, the <a href="Schengen_agreement" title="wikilink">Schengen agreement</a>, the <a href="Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy" title="wikilink">Common Security and Defence Policy</a>,the <a href="European_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">European Space Agency</a>, and education initiatives such as the <a href="ERASMUS_programme" title="wikilink">ERASMUS programme</a> or the <a href="European_Higher_Education_Area" title="wikilink">European Higher Education Area</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, among the 27 EU countries, 17 have joined the Eurozone, 22 have joined Schengen, and 26 compose the European Military.</p>
<p>Further, some countries which do not belong to the EU have joined several of these initiatives, albeit sometimes at a lower stage such as the <a href="European_Union_Customs_Union" title="wikilink">Customs Union</a>, the <a href="European_Economic_Area" title="wikilink">Common Market (EEA)</a>, or even unilaterally adopting the euro; by taking part in <a href="Schengen_Agreement" title="wikilink">Schengen</a>, either as a signatory state, or <em>de-facto</em>; or by joining some common military forces.</p>
<p>Thus, six non-EU countries have adopted the euro unilaterally, three the Schengen agreement officially and another three ones as <em>de-facto</em>, and other countries have joined common military corps.</p>
<p>The following table shows the status of each state membership to the different agreements promoted by the EU. It lists 43 countries, including the 27 EU member states, 5 candidate states, members of EEA (2 countries plus one EU candidate), 4 countries with some soft ties to the EU, such as a SAA or participation agreements, as well as the 4 remaining Microstates (<a href="Liechtenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liechtenstein</a> is an EEA member) and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> which has multiple bilateral treaties with the EU.</p>
<p>Hence, this table summarises some components of EU laws applied in the <a href="europe" title="wikilink">european</a> states. Some territories of EU member states also have a <a href="Special_Member_State_territories_and_the_European_Union#Summary" title="wikilink">special status</a> in regard to EU laws applied. Some territories of EFTA member states also have a <a href="European_Free_Trade_Association#EFTA_and_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">special status</a> in regard to EU laws applied as is the case with some <a href="Microstates_and_the_European_Union#Summary" title="wikilink">European microstates</a>. For member states that do not have special-status territories the EU law applies fully with the exception of the <a href="Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">Opt-outs in the European Union</a> and <a href="Mechanism_for_Cooperation_and_Verification" title="wikilink">states under a safeguard clause</a> or alternatively some states participate in <a href="Enhanced_co-operation" title="wikilink">Enhanced co-operation</a> between a subset of the EU members. Additionally there are various examples of non-participation by some EU members and non-EU states participation in particular <a href="Agencies_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">Agencies of the European Union</a>, the programmes for <a href="European_Higher_Education_Area" title="wikilink">European Higher Education Area</a>, <a href="European_Research_Area" title="wikilink">European Research Area</a> and <a href="Erasmus_Mundus" title="wikilink">Erasmus Mundus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="theories-of-integration">Theories of Integration</h2>
<p>The question of how to avoid wars between the nation-states was essential for the first theories. <a href="Federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Federalism</a> and <a href="Functionalism_in_international_relations" title="wikilink">Functionalism</a> proposed the containment of the nation-state, while <a href="Transactionalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transactionalism</a> sought to theorize the conditions for the stabilization of the nation-state system. One of the most influential theories of European integration is <a href="Neo-functionalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neo-functionalism</a>, developed by <a href="Ernst_B._Haas" title="wikilink">Ernst B. Haas</a> (1958) and further investigated by <a href="Leon_Lindberg" title="wikilink">Leon Lindberg</a> (1963). The important debate between neofunctionalism and (liberal) <a href="intergovernmentalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">intergovernmentalism</a> still remains central in understanding the development and set-backs of the European Union. But as the empirical world has changed, so have the theories and thus the understanding of European Integration. Today there is a relatively new focus on the complex policy making in the EU and <a href="Multi-level_governance" title="wikilink">Multi-level governance</a> (MLG) trying to produce a theory of the workings and development of the EU.</p>

<h3 id="concept-of-a-single-legal-space-for-the-cis-and-europe">Concept of a Single Legal Space for the CIS and Europe</h3>
<p>Russian legal scholar Oleg Kutafin and economist Alexander Zakharov produced a Concept of a Single Legal Space for the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="wikilink">CIS</a> and <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> in 2002. This idea was fully incorporated in the resolution of the 2003 Moscow Legal Forum. The Forum gathered representatives of more than 20 countries including 10 CIS countries. In 2007 both the International Union of Jurists of the CIS and the International Union (Commonwealth) of Advocates passed resolutions that strongly support the Concept of a Single Legal Space for Europe and post-Soviet Countries. The concept said: &quot;Obviously, to improve its legislation Russia and other countries of CIS should be oriented toward the continental legal family of European law. The civil law system is much closer to the Russian and other CIS countries will be instrumental in harmonizing legislation of CIS countries and the European Community but all values of common law should be also investigated on the subject of possible implementation in some laws and norms. It is suggested that the introduction of the concept of a Single legal space and a single Rule of Law space for Europe and CIS be implemented in four steps:</p>
<p>1.Development plans at the national level regarding adoption of selected EC legal standards in the legislation of CIS countries;</p>
