<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>As done with other Disney films, Walt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella. She later did the same kind of work for the characters of Princess Aurora in <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> and Anita Radcliff in <em>101 Dalmatians</em>.</p>
<p>According to Christopher Finch, author of <em>The Art of Walt Disney</em>: Disney insisted that all scenes involving human characters should be shot first in live-action to determine that they would work before the expensive business of animation was permitted to start. The animators did not like this way of working, feeling it detracted from their ability to create character. The animators understood the necessity for this approach and in retrospect acknowledged that Disney had handled things with considerable subtlety.</p>
