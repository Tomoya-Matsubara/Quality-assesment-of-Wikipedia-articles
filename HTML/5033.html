<p>In 1893, the <a href="Manchester,_Sheffield_and_Lincolnshire_Railway" title="wikilink">Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway</a> (MS&amp;LR) obtained <a href="Act_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Parliamentary approval</a> for the extension of its line from <a href="Annesley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Annesley</a> in <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. The final section of the extension saw the line connect with <a href="Metropolitan_Railway" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Railway</a>'s line at <a href="Quainton_Road_railway_station" title="wikilink">Quainton Road</a> before returning to MS&amp;LR metals at <a href="Finchley_Road_tube_station" title="wikilink">Finchley Road</a> and continuing to <a href="Marylebone_railway_station" title="wikilink">Marylebone</a>. Negotiations with the Metropolitan regarding running rights over its line came to deadlock prompting <a href="William_Pollitt" title="wikilink">Sir William Pollitt</a>, the MS&amp;LR's general manager, to reach agreement with the Great Western Railway in March 1896 for a route to London via Banbury which would avoid the Metropolitan.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The link line, which ran for a distance of , was opened without formality on 1 June 1900. The route had no intermediate stations but soon became an important freight route with 60,796 wagons exchanged between the MS&amp;LR (now known as the <a href="Great_Central_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Central</a>) and the Great Western within the first six months of operation; by 1904 this figure had risen by 50%. Two passenger services each way were initially provided by the Great Western, with the Great Central later supplementing this service with three additional trains in each direction.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The link was subsequently used for cross-country services, including <a href="Aberdeen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aberdeen</a> to <a href="Penzance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penzance</a>, <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> to <a href="Leicester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leicester</a> and <a href="Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle</a> to <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The line crossed the <a href="Northamptonshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northamptonshire</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Oxfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxfordshire</a> county boundary five times between  and ; at its closest approach to Chacombe, it was on the Oxfordshire side of the boundary, within the parish of Cropredy.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A small halt (situated between Chacombe and Coton Farm) was opened on 17 April 1911 and named Chalcombe Road Halt.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Serving a rural area, the halt closed on 6 February 1956, and the line itself closed on 4 September 1966.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
