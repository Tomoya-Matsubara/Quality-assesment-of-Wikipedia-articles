<p><img src="Edward_Elgar.jpg" title="fig:Edward Elgar, circa 1900" alt="Edward Elgar, circa 1900" width="275" /> <strong>Sir Edward William Elgar,</strong> <a href="baronet" title="wikilink">Bt</a>, <a href="Order_of_Merit" title="wikilink">OM</a>, <a href="Knight_Grand_Cross_of_the_Royal_Victorian_Order" title="wikilink">GCVO</a> (2 June 185723 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the <em><a href="Enigma_Variations" title="wikilink">Enigma Variations</a></em>, the <em><a href="Pomp_and_Circumstance_Marches" title="wikilink">Pomp and Circumstance Marches</a></em>, <a href="concerto" title="wikilink">concertos</a> for <a href="Violin_Concerto_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">violin</a> and <a href="Cello_Concerto_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">cello</a>, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including <em><a href="The_Dream_of_Gerontius" title="wikilink">The Dream of Gerontius</a></em>, chamber music and songs. He was appointed <a href="Master_of_the_King&#39;s_Musick" title="wikilink">Master of the King's Musick</a> in 1924.</p>
<p>Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> Britain, his <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edwardian</a> Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his <em>Enigma Variations</em> (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em> (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. The first of his <em>Pomp and Circumstance Marches</em> (1901) is well-known in the U.S. and in the UK.</p>
<p>In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death and did not begin to revive significantly until the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music remains more played in Britain than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Elgar has been described as the first composer to take the <a href="Gramophone_record" title="wikilink">gramophone</a> seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of recordings of his works. The introduction of the microphone in 1925 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>. These recordings were reissued on <a href="LP_record" title="wikilink">LP record</a> in the 1970s and on CD in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Edward Elgar was born in the small village of <a href="Broadheath,_Worcestershire" title="wikilink">Lower Broadheath</a>, outside <a href="Worcester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcester</a>, England. His father, William Henry Elgar (1821&lt;U+2013&gt;1906), was raised in <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a> and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William moved to Worcester, where he worked as a <a href="Piano_tuning" title="wikilink">piano tuner</a> and set up a shop selling sheet music and musical instruments.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1848 he married Ann Greening (1822&lt;U+2013&gt;1902), daughter of a farm worker.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Edward was the fourth of their seven children.{{#tag:ref|His siblings were Henry John (&quot;Harry&quot;; 1848&lt;U+2013&gt;64), Lucy Ann (&quot;Loo&quot;) (born 1852), Susannah Mary (&quot;Pollie&quot;; born 1854), Frederick Joseph (&quot;Jo&quot;; 1859&lt;U+2013&gt;66), Francis Thomas (&quot;Frank&quot;; born 1861), and Helen Agnes (&quot;Dott&quot; or &quot;Dot&quot;; born 1864).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>|group= n}} Ann Elgar had converted to <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> shortly before Edward's birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic, to the disapproval of his father.{{#tag:ref|William Elgar was evidently sceptical of <em>any</em> branch of the church: he wrote of &quot;the absurd superstition and play-house mummery of the Papist; the cold and formal ceremonies of the Church of England; or the bigotry and rank hypocrisy of the Wesleyan.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>|group= n}} William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and held the post of organist of St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Worcester, for thirty-seven years. At his instigation, masses by <a href="Luigi_Cherubini" title="wikilink">Cherubini</a> and <a href="Johann_Nepomuk_Hummel" title="wikilink">Hummel</a> were first heard at the <a href="Three_Choirs_Festival" title="wikilink">Three Choirs Festival</a> by the orchestra in which he played the violin.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="William-and-Ann-Elgar.jpg" title="fig:Elgar&#39;s parents, William and Ann Elgar" alt="Elgar&#39;s parents, William and Ann Elgar" /> Elgar's mother was interested in the arts and encouraged his musical development.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He inherited from her a discerning taste for literature and a passionate love of the countryside.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His friend and biographer <a href="William_Henry_Reed" title="wikilink">W. H. &quot;Billy&quot; Reed</a> wrote that Elgar's early surroundings had an influence that &quot;permeated all his work and gave to his whole life that subtle but none the less true and sturdy English quality.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Elgar himself later said, &quot;There is music in the air, music all around us, the world is full of it and you simply take as much as you require&quot;,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and &quot;The trees are singing my music &lt;U+2013&gt; or have I sung theirs?&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>|group= n}} He began composing at an early age; for a play written and acted by the Elgar children when he was about ten, he wrote music that forty years later he rearranged with only minor changes and orchestrated as the suites titled <em><a href="The_Wand_of_Youth" title="wikilink">The Wand of Youth</a></em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Until he was fifteen, Elgar received a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton){{#tag:ref|It is spelt &quot;Littleton&quot; by all the Elgar authories cited; however, some current sources, for example <a href="http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=488945&amp;resourceID=5">English Heritage</a>, spell it &quot;Lyttleton&quot;.|group= n}} House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers was more advanced violin studies with <a href="Adolf_Pollitzer" title="wikilink">Adolf Pollitzer</a>, during brief visits to London in 1877&lt;U+2013&gt;78. Elgar said &quot;my first music was learnt in the <a href="Worcester_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Cathedral</a> ... from books borrowed from the music library, when I was eight, nine or ten.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He later said that he had been most helped by <a href="Hubert_Parry" title="wikilink">Hubert Parry</a>'s articles in the <em><a href="Grove_Dictionary_of_Music_and_Musicians" title="wikilink">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the <a href="University_of_Music_and_Theatre_Leipzig" title="wikilink">Leipzig Conservatory</a> for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later a profile in <em><a href="The_Musical_Times" title="wikilink">The Musical Times</a></em> considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: &quot;Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader.{{#tag:ref|A profile in <em>The Musical Times</em> reported that Elgar &quot;read a great deal at this formulative period of his life. ... In this way he made the acquaintance of <a href="Philip_Sidney" title="wikilink">Sir Philip Sidney</a>'s <em><a href="Countess_of_Pembroke&#39;s_Arcadia" title="wikilink">Arcadia</a></em>, <a href="Richard_Baker_(chronicler)" title="wikilink">Richard Baker</a>'s <em>Chronicles</em>, <a href="Michael_Drayton" title="wikilink">Michael Drayton</a>'s <em><a href="Poly-Olbion" title="wikilink">Polyolbion</a></em>&quot;, and the works of <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>|group= n}} Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After a few months, Elgar left the solicitor to embark on a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's shop.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He was an active member of the Worcester <a href="Glee_club" title="wikilink">Glee Club</a>, along with his father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the country,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At twenty-two he took up the post of conductor of the attendants' band at the <a href="Powick_Hospital" title="wikilink">Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum</a> in <a href="Powick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Powick</a>, three miles (5 km) from Worcester.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The band consisted of: piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and piano.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, including <a href="quadrille" title="wikilink">quadrilles</a> and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. <em>The Musical Times</em> wrote, &quot;This practical experience proved to be of the greatest value to the young musician. ... He acquired a practical knowledge of the capabilities of these different instruments. ... He thereby got to know intimately the tone colour, the ins and outs of these and many other instruments.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to Powick once a week.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Another post he held in his early days was professor of the violin at the <a href="New_College_Worcester" title="wikilink">Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar thrived in Worcester's musical circles.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He played in the violins at the Worcester and <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a> Festivals, and one great experience was to play <a href="Anton&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k" title="wikilink">Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k</a>'s <a href="Symphony_No._6_(Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 6</a> and <em><a href="Stabat_Mater" title="wikilink">Stabat Mater</a></em> under the composer's baton.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Elgar arranged numerous pieces by <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a>, <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Joseph_Haydn" title="wikilink">Haydn</a>, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

He heard <a href="Camille_Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns" title="wikilink">Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns</a> play the organ at the <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;glise_de_la_Madeleine" title="wikilink">Madeleine</a> and attended concerts by first-rate orchestras. In 1882 he wrote, &quot;I got pretty well dosed with <a href="Robert_Schumann" title="wikilink">Schumann</a> (my ideal!), <a href="Johannes_Brahms" title="wikilink">Brahms</a>, <a href="Anton_Rubinstein" title="wikilink">Rubinstein</a> &amp; <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a>, so had no cause to complain.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In Leipzig he visited a friend, Helen Weaver, who was a student at the Conservatoire. They became engaged in the summer of 1883, but for unknown reasons the engagement was broken off the next year .<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Elgar was greatly distressed, and some of his later cryptic dedications of romantic music may have alluded to Helen and his feelings for her.{{#tag:ref|Kennedy (ODNB) mentions the 'Romanza' variation (no. 13) in the <em>Enigma Variations</em> and the Violin Concerto as possible examples, the former being headed &quot;****&quot; and the latter being inscribed as enshrining an unnamed soul.|group= n}}</p>
<p>In 1883, while a regular member of the orchestra for W. C. Stockley's winter concert seasons in Birmingham, Elgar took part in a performance of one of his first works for full orchestra, the <em>S&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;nade mauresque</em>. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece, but, as Stockley later recalled, &quot;he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, &quot;My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, so sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money &lt;U+2013&gt; not a cent.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Elgar-Alice-c1891.jpg" title="fig:Edward and Alice Elgar, circa 1891" alt="Edward and Alice Elgar, circa 1891" /> When Elgar was twenty-nine, he took on a new pupil, <a href="Caroline_Alice_Elgar" title="wikilink">Caroline Alice Roberts</a>, daughter of the late <a href="Major-General_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Major-General</a> Sir Henry Roberts, and a published author of verse and prose fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife three years later. Elgar's biographer <a href="Michael_Kennedy_(music_critic)" title="wikilink">Michael Kennedy</a> writes, &quot;Alice's family was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a shop and was a Roman Catholic. She was disinherited.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> They were married on 8 May 1889, at <a href="Brompton_Oratory" title="wikilink">Brompton Oratory</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> From then until her death she acted as his business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings and was a perceptive musical critic.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> She did her best to gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In time he would learn to accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career.{{#tag:ref|When Elgar was knighted in 1904, his daughter Carice said, &quot;I am so glad for Mother's sake that Father has been knighted.

Their only child, Carice Irene, was born at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in Elgar's dedication of <em>Salut d'Amour</em>, was a contraction of her mother's names Caroline and Alice.</p>

In the days before miniature scores and recordings were available, it was not easy for young composers to get to know new music.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Elgar took every chance to do so at the <a href="The_Crystal_Palace" title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a> concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of orchestration from whom he learned much, such as <a href="Hector_Berlioz" title="wikilink">Berlioz</a> and <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> His own compositions, however, made little impact on London's musical scene. <a href="August_Manns" title="wikilink">August Manns</a> conducted Elgar's orchestral version of <em>Salut d'amour</em> and the Suite in D at the Crystal Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ voluntaries, and partsongs.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be within reach but vanished unexpectedly.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> For example, an offer from the <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a>, to run through some of his works was withdrawn at the last second when <a href="Arthur_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Sir Arthur Sullivan</a> arrived unannounced to rehearse some of his own music.

<h3 id="growing-reputation">Growing reputation</h3>
<p>During the 1890s, Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the <a href="English_Midlands" title="wikilink">English Midlands</a>. <em>The Black Knight</em> (1892) and <em>King Olaf</em> (1896), both inspired by <a href="Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Longfellow</a>, <em>The Light of Life</em> (1896) and <em>Caractacus</em> (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in <a href="Music_Sales_Group" title="wikilink">Novello and Co</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Other works of this decade included the <em><a href="Serenade_for_Strings_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Serenade for Strings</a></em> (1892) and <em><a href="Three_Bavarian_Dances" title="wikilink">Three Bavarian Dances</a></em> (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer <a href="Samuel_Coleridge-Taylor" title="wikilink">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a> to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career.{{#tag:ref|Elgar, in recommending Coleridge-Taylor for a commission from the festival, said, &quot;He is far and away the cleverest fellow going among the young men.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>|group= n}} Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was &quot;very sick at heart over music&quot; and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend <a href="August_Jaeger" title="wikilink">August Jaeger</a> tried to lift his spirits: &quot;A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you.

At the age of forty-two, Elgar produced the <em><a href="Enigma_Variations" title="wikilink">Enigma Variations</a></em>, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor <a href="Hans_Richter_(conductor)" title="wikilink">Hans Richter</a>. In Elgar's own words, &quot;I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme.

<p>The work is formally titled <em>Variations on an Original Theme</em>; the word &quot;Enigma&quot; appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of the title.

<p>By contrast, the remaining work, the <a href="Cello_Concerto_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Cello Concerto in E minor</a>, had a disastrous premiere, at the opening concert of the <a href="London_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Symphony Orchestra</a>'s 1919&lt;U+2013&gt;20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by <a href="Albert_Coates_(musician)" title="wikilink">Albert Coates</a>, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, &quot;that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing.&quot;<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The critic of <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>, <a href="Ernest_Newman" title="wikilink">Ernest Newman</a>, wrote, &quot;There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is lovely stuff, very simple &lt;U+2013&gt; that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's music in the last couple of years &lt;U+2013&gt; but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity.&quot;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, <a href="Felix_Salmond" title="wikilink">Felix Salmond</a>, who played for him again later.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In contrast with the First Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

Reed singles out a performance of the Second Symphony in March 1920 conducted by &quot;a young man almost unknown to the public&quot;, <a href="Adrian_Boult" title="wikilink">Adrian Boult</a>, for bringing &quot;the grandeur and nobility of the work&quot; to a wider public. Also in 1920, Landon Ronald presented an all-Elgar concert at the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Hall" title="wikilink">Queen's Hall</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Alice Elgar wrote with enthusiasm about the reception of the symphony, but this was one of the last times she heard Elgar's music played in public.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> After a short illness, she died of lung cancer on 7 April 1920, at the age of seventy-two.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Elgar was devastated by the loss of his wife.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> With no public demand for new works, and deprived of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed himself to be deflected from composition.

Almost nothing is recorded about the events that Elgar encountered during the trip, which gave the historical novelist <a href="James_Hamilton-Paterson" title="wikilink">James Hamilton-Paterson</a> considerable latitude when writing <em>Gerontius</em>, a fictional account of the journey.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>After Alice's death, Elgar sold the Hampstead house, and after living for a short time in a flat in <a href="St_James&#39;s" title="wikilink">St James's</a> in the heart of London, he moved back to Worcestershire, to the village of <a href="Kempsey,_Worcestershire" title="wikilink">Kempsey</a>, where he lived from 1923 to 1927.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> He did not wholly abandon composition in these years. He made large-scale symphonic arrangements of works by <a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Bach</a> and <a href="George_Frideric_Handel" title="wikilink">Handel</a> and wrote his <em>Empire March</em> and eight songs <em><a href="Pageant_of_Empire_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Pageant of Empire</a></em> for the 1924 <a href="British_Empire_Exhibition" title="wikilink">British Empire Exhibition</a>.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Shortly after these were published, he was appointed <a href="Master_of_the_Queen&#39;s_Music" title="wikilink">Master of the King's Musick</a> on 13 May 1924, following the death of <a href="Walter_Parratt" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Parratt</a>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1926 onwards, Elgar made a series of recordings of his own works. Elgar, described by the music writer Robert Philip as &quot;the first composer to take the gramophone seriously&quot;,<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> had already recorded much of his music by the early acoustic-recording process for <a href="Gramophone_Company" title="wikilink">His Master's Voice (HMV)</a> from 1914 onwards, but the introduction of electrical microphones in 1925 transformed the gramophone from a novelty into a realistic medium for reproducing orchestral and choral music.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Elgar was the first composer to take full advantage of this technological advance.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> <a href="Fred_Gaisberg" title="wikilink">Fred Gaisberg</a> of HMV, who produced Elgar's recordings, set up a series of sessions to capture on disc the composer's interpretations of his major orchestral works, including the <em>Enigma Variations</em>, <em>Falstaff</em>, the first and second symphonies, and the cello and violin concertos. For most of these, the orchestra was the LSO, but the <em>Variations</em> were played by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. Later in the series of recordings, Elgar also conducted two newly-founded orchestras, Boult's <a href="BBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Thomas_Beecham" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>'s <a href="London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>.</p>
<p>Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and <a href="RCA_Records" title="wikilink">RCA Victor</a>. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on <a href="LP_record" title="wikilink">LP</a>, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The recordings have subsequently been issued on compact disc.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by <a href="Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> for a newsreel depicting a recording session of <em>Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1</em> at the opening of EMI's <a href="Abbey_Road_Studios" title="wikilink">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to &quot;play this tune as though you've never heard it before.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> A late piece of Elgar's, The <em><a href="Nursery_Suite" title="wikilink">Nursery Suite</a></em>, was an early example of a studio premiere; its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the <a href="George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Duke of York</a>, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The elder daughter was Princess Elizabeth of York (later <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>).| group= n}}</p>

<p>In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin.

His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would &quot;tinker&quot; with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> but at other times he said, &quot;If I can't complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it &lt;U+2013&gt; or write a better one.&quot;<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> After Elgar's death, <a href="Percy_M._Young" title="wikilink">Percy M.

<p>Inoperable intestinal cancer was discovered during an operation on 8 October 1933.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Elgar died on 23 February 1934 at the age of seventy-six and was buried next to his wife at St. Wulstan's Church in <a href="Little_Malvern" title="wikilink">Little Malvern</a>.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<h3 id="influences-antecedents-and-early-works">Influences, antecedents and early works</h3>
<p>Elgar was contemptuous of folk music<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling <a href="William_Byrd" title="wikilink">William Byrd</a> and his contemporaries &quot;museum pieces&quot;. Of later English composers, he regarded <a href="Henry_Purcell" title="wikilink">Henry Purcell</a> as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were <a href="George_Frideric_Handel" title="wikilink">Handel</a>, <a href="Anton&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k" title="wikilink">Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k</a> and, to some degree, <a href="Johannes_Brahms" title="wikilink">Brahms</a>. In Elgar's <a href="chromaticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">chromaticism</a>, the influence of <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a> is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth century French composers, <a href="Hector_Berlioz" title="wikilink">Berlioz</a>, <a href="Jules_Massenet" title="wikilink">Massenet</a>, <a href="Camille_Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns" title="wikilink">Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns</a> and, particularly, <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;o_Delibes" title="wikilink">Delibes</a>, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878&lt;U+2013&gt;81, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in <em>Grove's Dictionary</em> finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except <em><a href="Salut_d&#39;Amour" title="wikilink">Salut d'Amour</a></em> and (as arranged decades later into <em><a href="The_Wand_of_Youth" title="wikilink">The Wand of Youth</a></em> Suites) some of the childhood sketches.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889&lt;U+2013&gt;91, the overture <em><a href="Froissart_Overture_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Froissart</a></em>, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by <a href="Felix_Mendelssohn" title="wikilink">Mendelssohn</a> and <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a>, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the <em><a href="Serenade_for_Strings_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Serenade for Strings</a></em> and <em><a href="Three_Bavarian_Dances" title="wikilink">Three Bavarian Dances</a></em>. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. <a href="William_Henry_Reed" title="wikilink">W. H. Reed</a> expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong <em>The Snow</em>, for female voices, and <em><a href="Sea_Pictures" title="wikilink">Sea Pictures</a></em>, a cycle of five songs for <a href="contralto" class="uri" title="wikilink">contralto</a> and orchestra which remains in the repertory.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were <em>The Black Knight</em>, <em>King Olaf</em>, <em>The Light of Life</em>, <em>The Banner of St George</em> and <em>Caractacus</em>. He also wrote a <em>Te Deum</em> and <em>Benedictus</em> for the <a href="Three_Choirs_Festival" title="wikilink">Hereford Festival</a>. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of <a href="leitmotif" title="wikilink">leitmotifs</a>, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the <em><a href="Enigma_Variations" title="wikilink">Enigma Variations</a></em>, appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

Most of them are orchestral. Reed wrote, &quot;Elgar's genius rose to its greatest height in his orchestral works&quot; and quoted the composer as saying that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The <em>Enigma Variations</em> made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> His next orchestral works, <em><a href="Cockaigne_(In_London_Town)" title="wikilink">Cockaigne (In London Town)</a></em>, a concert-overture (1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1901), the first two <em><a href="Pomp_and_Circumstance_Marches" title="wikilink">Pomp and Circumstance</a></em> marches (1901), and the gentle <em><a href="Dream_Children_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Dream Children</a></em> (1902), are all short: the longest of them, <em>Cockaigne</em>, lasting less than fifteen minutes. <em><a href="In_the_South_(Alassio)" title="wikilink">In the South (Alassio)</a></em> (1903&lt;U+2013&gt;1904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a <a href="tone_poem" title="wikilink">tone poem</a> and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> The work reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find that in the middle part &quot;Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> In 1905 Elgar completed the <em><a href="Introduction_and_Allegro_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">Introduction and Allegro for Strings</a></em>.

<p>During the next four years, however, Elgar composed three major concert pieces, which, though shorter than comparable works by some of his European contemporaries, are among the most substantial such works by an English composer.

Both are long and powerful, without published programmes, only hints and quotations to indicate some inward drama from which they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but differ from it to the extent that ... they were considered prolix and slackly constructed by some critics.

<p>The major works for voices and orchestra of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: <em><a href="The_Dream_of_Gerontius" title="wikilink">The Dream of Gerontius</a></em> (1900), and the oratorios <em><a href="The_Apostles_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">The Apostles</a></em> (1903) and <em><a href="The_Kingdom_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">The Kingdom</a></em> (1906); and two shorter odes, the <em><a href="Coronation_Ode" title="wikilink">Coronation Ode</a></em> (1902) and <em><a href="The_Music_Makers_(Elgar)" title="wikilink">The Music Makers</a></em> (1912). The first of the odes, as a <em>pi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ce d'occasion</em>, has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as <a href="Richard_Strauss" title="wikilink">Richard Strauss</a> quoted himself in <em><a href="Ein_Heldenleben" title="wikilink">Ein Heldenleben</a></em>.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> The choral works were all successful, although the first, <em>Gerontius</em>, was and remains the best-loved and most performed.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a>, &quot;This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.&quot;<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>Elgar's other works of his middle period include incidental music for <em><a href="Diarmuid_and_Grania" title="wikilink">Grania and Diarmid</a></em>, a play by <a href="George_Moore_(novelist)" title="wikilink">George Moore</a> and <a href="William_Butler_Yeats" title="wikilink">W.

Of the former, Yeats called Elgar's music &quot;wonderful in its heroic melancholy&quot;.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed observes, &quot;it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory to the same extent as he did that of the orchestra.&quot;<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="final-years-and-posthumous-completions">Final years and posthumous completions</h3>
<p>After the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made arrangements of works by <a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Bach</a>, Handel and <a href="Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Chopin" title="wikilink">Chopin</a>, in distinctively Elgarian orchestration,<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the <em><a href="Nursery_Suite" title="wikilink">Nursery Suite</a></em> (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. <em>The Gramophone</em> described the opening of the new work as something &quot;thrilling ... unforgettably gaunt&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth <em><a href="Pomp_and_Circumstance_Marches" title="wikilink">Pomp and Circumstance March</a></em>, premiered at <a href="the_Proms" title="wikilink">the Proms</a> in August 2006.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Elgar's sketches for a piano concerto dating from 1913 were elaborated by the composer Robert Walker and first performed in August 1997 by the pianist <a href="David_Owen_Norris" title="wikilink">David Owen Norris</a>.

<h3 id="reputation">Reputation</h3>
<p>Views of Elgar's stature have varied in the decades since his music came to prominence at the beginning of the twentieth century. Richard Strauss, as noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>, unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, called the orchestration &quot;magnificently modern&quot;.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Hans Richter rated Elgar as &quot;the greatest modern composer&quot; in any country, and Richter's colleague <a href="Arthur_Nikisch" title="wikilink">Arthur Nikisch</a> considered the First Symphony &quot;a masterpiece of the first order&quot; to be &quot;justly ranked with the great symphonic models &lt;U+2013&gt; Beethoven and Brahms.&quot;<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> By contrast, the critic <a href="Walter_J._Turner" title="wikilink">W.

After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the <a href="Edwardian_era" title="wikilink">Edwardian era</a>, and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance in more than three years.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> <a href="Henry_J._Wood" title="wikilink">Henry Wood</a> and younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle of the century, his works were not well-represented.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1924, the music scholar <a href="Edward_Joseph_Dent" title="wikilink">Edward J. Dent</a> wrote an article for a German music journal in which he identified four features of Elgar's style that gave offence to a section of English opinion (namely, Dent indicated, the academic and snobbish section): &quot;too emotional&quot;, &quot;not quite free from vulgarity&quot;, &quot;pompous&quot;, and &quot;too deliberately noble in expression&quot;.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> This article was reprinted in 1930 and caused controversy.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> In the later years of the century there was, in Britain at least, a revival of interest in Elgar's music. The features that had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different perspective. In 1956, the reference book <em><a href="The_Record_Guide" title="wikilink">The Record Guide</a></em> wrote of the Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career: </p>
<p>By the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but &quot;a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations.&quot;<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sibelius-strauss-RVW-stravinsky.jpg" title="fig:Composers who admired Elgar included (top) Sibelius (l) and Richard Strauss and (below) Vaughan Williams (l) and Stravinsky|alt=head and shoulders portraits of four men.

Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod. How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be &quot;the most English of composers&quot;? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which &quot;could use the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music is English.&quot;<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before. In 1930 <em>The Times</em> wrote, &quot;When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal. ... but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian.&quot;<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> As for Elgar's &quot;Englishness&quot;, his fellow-composers recognised it: Richard Strauss and <a href="Igor_Stravinsky" title="wikilink">Stravinsky</a> made particular reference to it,<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> and <a href="Jean_Sibelius" title="wikilink">Sibelius</a> called him, &quot;the personification of the true English character in music ... a noble personality and a born aristocrat&quot;.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Among Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The <em>Enigma Variations</em> are generally counted among them.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em> has also been given high praise by Elgarians,<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> and the Cello Concerto is similarly rated.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Many rate the Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in <em>The Record Guide</em>,<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> and in a long analytical article in <em>The Musical Quarterly</em>, <a href="Daniel_Gregory_Mason" title="wikilink">Daniel Gregory Mason</a> criticised the first movement of the concerto for a &quot;kind of sing-songiness ... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry.&quot;<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> <em>Falstaff</em> also divides opinion. It has never been a great popular favourite,<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> and Kennedy and Reed identify shortcomings in it.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In a <em><a href="The_Musical_Times" title="wikilink">Musical Times</a></em> 1957 centenary symposium on Elgar led by Vaughan Williams, by contrast, several contributors share <a href="Eric_Blom" title="wikilink">Eric Blom</a>'s view that <em>Falstaff</em> is the greatest of all Elgar's works.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>The two symphonies divide opinion even more sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its &quot;over-obvious rhythmic scheme&quot;, but calls the First &quot;Elgar's masterpiece. ... It is hard to see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony.&quot;<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express reservations about one or both symphonies.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in <em><a href="Gramophone_(magazine)" title="wikilink">The Gramophone</a></em>, &quot;For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work.&quot;<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> The critic <a href="John_Warrack" title="wikilink">John Warrack</a> wrote, &quot;There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief&quot;,<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and <em>angst</em> and is marked instead by a &quot;benevolent tranquillity.&quot;<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. <em>The Record Guide</em> in 1955 could list only one currently-available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the <em>Enigma Variations</em>, one of <em>Falstaff</em>, and none of <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, and more than a dozen of <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed.
