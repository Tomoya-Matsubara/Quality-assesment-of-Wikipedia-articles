<p>The <strong>Grey-necked Rockfowl</strong> (<em>Picathartes oreas</em>) is a medium-sized <a href="bird" class="uri" title="wikilink">bird</a> in the <a href="family(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="Picathartidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picathartidae</a> with a long neck and tail. Also known as the <strong>Grey-necked Picathartes</strong>, this <a href="passerine" class="uri" title="wikilink">passerine</a> is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from southwest Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and southwest Gabon. It additionally lives on the island of <a href="Bioko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bioko</a>. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and <a href="inselberg" title="wikilink">inselbergs</a> in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a <a href="superspecies" class="uri" title="wikilink">superspecies</a> with its close relative, the <a href="White-necked_Rockfowl" title="wikilink">White-necked Rockfowl</a>. The Grey-necked Rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper <a href="mandible" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandible</a> and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird&lt;U+2019&gt;s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin at the peak of the crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.</p>
<p>This rockfowl feeds primarily on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following <em><a href="Dorylus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorylus</a></em> army ant swarms, feeding on <a href="Ant-follower" title="wikilink">insects flushed by the ants</a>. Rockfowl move through the forest mainly through a series of hops and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either alone or in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The Grey-necked Rockfowl is <a href="monogamous" class="uri" title="wikilink">monogamous</a> and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month.</p>
<p>This species is classified as <a href="vulnerable_species" title="wikilink">Vulnerable</a> as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl is considered one of Africa&lt;U+2019&gt;s most desirable birds by <a href="birder" title="wikilink">birders</a> and is a symbol of <a href="ecotourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecotourism</a> across its range.</p>

<p>This rockfowl builds its nest onto the sides of rocks, normally in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Nests need to be built under an overhang to protect it from water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> These streams, particularly those located at the base of a nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Nests on rock surfaces are normally built  above the ground.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the <a href="buttress_root" title="wikilink">buttress root</a> of a <em><a href="Piptadeniastrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piptadeniastrum</a></em> tree above a small stream.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's <a href="Lop&lt;U+00E9&gt;_National_Park" title="wikilink">Lop&lt;U+00E9&gt; National Park</a>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Nests are built at least away  from each other, and in some cases up to .<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The nest is normally  thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was  thick.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> It is about  wide and  long and weighs about .<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>One to three eggs, normally two, are laid, with the second egg being laid between 24 and 48 hours after the first.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The eggs are variable in coloration and can be a light yellow-brown with dark brown blotches, creamy white with dark brown or grey blotches, or pale grey with brown mottling.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The eggs weigh about  and have an average size of  by .<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The rockfowl begins to <a href="avian_incubation" title="wikilink">incubate</a> after both eggs are laid.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for less than five minutes at a time with nearly two hours between sessions.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Both the male and female rockfowl incubate.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> When the incubating bird's mate comes, it gives a brief call that causes the incubating bird to leave the nest.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> In the two days prior to hatching, the adult rockfowl prods at the eggs, sometimes with food in its beak.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Incubation lasts for 21 to 24 days.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> When the infants hatch, they hatch about a day apart.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The adult rockfowl quickly remove the eggshell fragments from the nest.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> The newborn weighs only  after hatching, but it quickly gains weight.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The eyes open and the tail begins to grow on the fifth day.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> During the first couple of days, food is brought to the nestlings three to six times an hour, peaking in the evening.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Begging nestlings expose their beak and gape to their parent, though they do not make a sound.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> The second-hatched nestling often fails to gain weight and dies, and there is evidence suggesting that the adults cannibalize the remains.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> For the first ten days after hatching, one adult rockfowl stays and guards the nestlings while the other collects food; despite this, nests have been destroyed by <a href="chimpanzee" title="wikilink">chimpanzees</a> and <a href="drill_(mammal)" title="wikilink">drills</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The chicks leave the nest after 24 days.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Infanticide has been recorded in this species, with rockfowl killing other rockfowl's young.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> In one case, a second pair of rockfowl moved onto a nest after killing the first pair's nestlings.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
