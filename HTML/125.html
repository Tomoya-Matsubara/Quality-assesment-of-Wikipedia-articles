<p>is a Japanese-developed <a href="console_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">console role-playing game</a> developed and published by <a href="Square_Co." title="wikilink">Square</a> (now <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a>) for the <a href="Sony_Computer_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Sony</a> <a href="PlayStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a> <a href="video_game_console" title="wikilink">video game console</a> in <a href="2000_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">2000</a>. The game was released in Japan in February 2000, in the United States in May 2000, and in Canada and Europe later, as part of Square's promotional &quot;Summer of Adventure&quot; game package, and in <a href="PAL" class="uri" title="wikilink">PAL</a> territories in June 2000. It was largely developed by the team responsible for <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_Tactics" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, with <a href="Yasumi_Matsuno" title="wikilink">Yasumi Matsuno</a> serving as producer and director.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the <a href="fictional_country" title="wikilink">fictional kingdom</a> of Valendia and the <a href="ghost_town" title="wikilink">ruined city</a> of Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the <a href="prologue" class="uri" title="wikilink">prologue</a>, Ashley was blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happened one week before the murder.</p>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> is unique as a console action/adventure role-playing game because it features no shops and no player interaction between other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Overall, the game received positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> is a solo <a href="dungeon_crawl" title="wikilink">dungeon crawl</a>, in which the player controls Ashley Riot from a <a href="isometric_projection" title="wikilink">third-person perspective</a> while exploring Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde and the <a href="catacombs" class="uri" title="wikilink">catacombs</a> underneath. The player may also switch into <a href="first-person_perspective" title="wikilink">first-person perspective</a> to allow for a 360&lt;U+00B0&gt; view using the L and R buttons on the <a href="Dual_Analog" title="wikilink">game controller</a>. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system#Three-dimensional_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">three-dimensional</a> field map. Navigation is in <a href="real-time_computing" title="wikilink">real-time</a>, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Ashley can run, jump, and push crates and cubes to navigate around obstacles, adding <a href="Computer_puzzle_game" title="wikilink">puzzle</a> and <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platforming</a> elements to gameplay.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> During the game, the player must sometimes solve block puzzles to advance the story. When the player returns to a completed block puzzle room, a time-attack mode called &quot;Evolve, or Die!!&quot; begins. Players must reach the end of the room in the shortest time possible, after which they are ranked. This stage is optional and can be turned off from the menu.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In the field map, players may engage the enemy as soon as they enter Battle Mode. In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a wire frame sphere appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a <a href="Music_video_game" title="wikilink">rhythm game</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his <a href="hit_points" title="wikilink">hit points</a> (HP) for increased damage.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Magic in <em>Vagrant Story</em> is learned later in the game using <a href="Grimoire" title="wikilink">Grimoires</a>, items dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell associated with the Grimoire will remain in the menu, and players only need to spend <a href="magic_point" title="wikilink">magic points</a> (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create <a href="Status_effect" title="wikilink">status effects</a>, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Risk is an essential element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates &lt;U+2014&gt; lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score <a href="critical_hit" title="wikilink">critical hits</a> and restore higher HP.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em>'s crafting system allows the player to create and customize weapons and armor in designated &quot;workshop&quot; areas, inputting various ranges, strengths, and statistics. Weapons fall into one of three main damage types: blunt, piercing, and edged. Equipment are influenced by their material and affinity to enemy classes and elements.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Affinities influence the effectiveness of weapons and armor; however, equipment loses one form of affinity when it gains another type. Weapons and armor can be combined, merging their affinities and sometimes creating a new type of blade or armor in the process.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Like several Square titles, the <a href="New_Game_Plus" title="wikilink">New Game Plus</a> option is made available to the player upon first completing the game. In <em>Vagrant Story</em>, selecting &quot;New Game+&quot; enables the player to replay the story using their end-game weapons, items, and statistics instead of the defaults.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This option allows players to access a hidden level, which features more intimidating enemies and more powerful equipment. The story does not change, and original enemy statistics will remain at default.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> is set in the fictitious city of Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde, while the kingdom of Valendia is engulfed in <a href="civil_war" title="wikilink">civil war</a>. Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde is an old town with a history spanning more than two millennia. Located on an island surrounded by <a href="reef" title="wikilink">reefs</a>, the walls have been the &quot;witness of many battles&quot; and are &quot;stronger than the mightiest forts of Valendia&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In its golden years, Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde was a thriving community until an earthquake struck the town 25 years before the game, destroying the city and leaving the ground unstable.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The Grand Cathedral and the Temple of Kiltia are at the center of the city. Beneath the ground is an abandoned <a href="mineshaft" class="uri" title="wikilink">mineshaft</a> and <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a>, the darkened <a href="labyrinth" title="wikilink">labyrinths</a> of an &quot;Undercity&quot;, and the dark Iron Maiden dungeon.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The maze-like Snowfly Forest, named for the so-called snowflies that can be found within, grows around the city. Other locations include the Graylands, the setting for the prologue event; and Valnain, the city where the Valendia Knights of Peace's Headquarters is located. While Valendia and Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde are fictitious, the game's scenery is inspired by real-life landscapes of the southwest of <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, including the city of <a href="Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
<p>The <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> is Ashley Riot, a male member of the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP) in pursuit of a <a href="cult" class="uri" title="wikilink">cult</a> leader named Sydney Losstarot. Sydney, leader of the religious cult M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp, laid siege to Duke Bardorba's <a href="manor" class="uri" title="wikilink">manor</a> in search of a key and kidnapped Bardorba's son, Joshua. Ashley's partner is Callo Merlose, an agent of the VKP Inquisitors. Also attempting to capture Sydney is Romeo Guildenstern of the Crimson Blades, whose mission was made without the approval of the VKP.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Ashley is a Riskbreaker, a militant division of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past.</p>
<p>The Crimson Blades, under direct orders of Cardinal Batistum, are a group that is part of the Cardinal's Knights of the Cross, in charge of seeking <a href="heretic" title="wikilink">heretics</a> and quelling cults.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Romeo Guildenstern, their leader, is a pious man, deeply faithful to his belief and consequently immune to the Dark's powers. Under orders of the Cardinal, he pursues Sydney along with Samantha, Duane, Grissom, Tieger and Neesa.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp is a cult based in Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The city suffered a catastrophe when the population was killed in an earthquake.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The city, filled with corpses controlled by Darkness, is the cult's stronghold. Sydney and his accomplice, Hardin, survive the pursuit of the Crimson Blade, though Hardin sometimes doubts Sydney's intentions.</p>
<h3 id="story">Story</h3>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> begins in the Graylands, where Ashley and Callo are sent by the VKP to Duke Bardorba's manor to investigate the Duke's involvement with M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp and the Cardinal's interest in Sydney Losstarot.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Ashley infiltrates the manor and encounters Sydney, witnessing his powers first hand.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Sydney escapes with his accomplice Hardin and the Duke's son Joshua, leaving Ashley with a clue to his whereabouts.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This event was dubbed the &quot;Graylands Incident&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="Vs-ashleywyvern.jpg" title="fig:Ashley Riot faces a wyvern during the opening sequence." alt="Ashley Riot faces a wyvern during the opening sequence." width="200" /> Ashley and Callo arrive in Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde and a lone Ashley infiltrates the city through the underground wine cellars. Along the way, he learns of objects holding magical power known as Grimoires and the city's power to spawn the undead and mythological creatures.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He encounters Guildenstern and his lover Samantha, and learns of the condition known as incomplete death and the Cardinal's true intention for his pursuit of Sydney: <a href="immortality" class="uri" title="wikilink">immortality</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Crimson Blades confront Ashley and reveals his presence to Guildenstern.</p>
<p>Escaping unharmed, Ashley encounters Rosencrantz who intends to join him, though Ashley declines.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Rosencrantz tells him of the VKP and the Parliaments' knowledge of the dark powers of Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde, and that the hidden powers deep within a person can be unleashed with the help of the Dark. In his encounters with Sydney, Ashley is shown visions of his past, where his wife Tia and his son Marco are killed by rogues, who later turned out to be Ashley himself. Meeting Rosencrantz again, Ashley learns that they were not his family, but mistaken targets during their mission. Ashley's guilt over their deaths was manipulated by the VKP to turn Ashley into a loyal Riskbreaker.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Ashley recalls his hidden battle skills and experiences &quot;<a href="clairvoyance" class="uri" title="wikilink">clairvoyance</a>&quot;, seeing the progress of the Crimson Blades, which leads him to the Great Cathedral.</p>
<p>Sydney had captured Callo earlier and brought her with them. Callo learned that Hardin was skeptical of Sydney's plans.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> She begins to develop the powers of &quot;heart-seeing&quot;, a form of <a href="telepathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">telepathy</a>, as they continue their escape deeper into Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> With her powers, she learned of Sydney's intentions and Hardin's reason to join M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp and his closeness to Joshua.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Sydney left them to stop the others from advancing; taunting Guildenstern and Samantha, and provoking Ashley to follow him as he intends to succeed his powers to Ashley.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Ashley was not interested in inheriting the powers of Darkness; seeing that Callo had been captured, his only intention is to rescue her.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>While discussing the Gran Grimoire, a powerful source of magic, Guildenstern and Samantha discover ancient Kildean letterings carved throughout the city walls.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Rosencrantz reveals that the city is the Gran Grimoire and its power lies at the city center: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz uses his immunity against Darkness and forces Sydney to surrender his powers.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove that he is not a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Sydney refuses to listen and kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor.</p>
<p>Guildenstern continues on to the Great Cathedral in the center of the city, leading him to Callo, Hardin and Joshua. Interrogating Hardin about a certain &quot;key&quot; known as the Blood-Sin,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Guildenstern reveals his intentions in acquiring the Dark's powers.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Sydney arrives to teleport Hardin and the rest away, leaving him to Guildenstern. Guildenstern acquires the &quot;key&quot; from him and murders Samantha as his sacrifice for the powers of darkness. Ashley arrives later and listens as Sydney reveals his true intentions.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Ashley then confronts Guildenstern and manages to defeat him.</p>
<p>Upon Guildenstern's defeat, Ashley, now bearing the &quot;key&quot;, carries Sydney out of the collapsing city. The creatures spawned within the city begin to disappear. Callo, Hardin and Joshua escape the city, though Hardin dies. In the epilogue, Duke Bardorba's manor receives a visit from Ashley. In a report received by the VKP a week after the Graylands Incident, the duke was found murdered, and Ashley became the prime suspect, though he was never found again.</p>
<h3 id="connections-to-final-fantasy-xii">Connections to <em>Final Fantasy XII</em></h3>
<p>The 2006 console role-playing game <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_XII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> contains several references to <em>Vagrant Story</em>. Terms such as Riskbreaker, Le&lt;U+00E1&gt;monde and Kildea (albeit with different spellings in the localizations), are commonly used in both games. Yasumi Matsuno, the creator of <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>, was interviewed by Joypad, a French gaming magazine, in 2004 on <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> and the game world he conceived, <a href="Ivalice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ivalice</a>, when he joined Square in <a href="1995_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1995</a>. He describes Ivalice as a complex world with a very long history and the stories of <em>Vagrant Story</em>, <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Matsuno, the game's producer and director, preferred to create a new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. <em>Vagrant Story</em> is regarded as a mixture of genres as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place <em>Vagrant Story</em> into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <img src="Saint-Emilion_Eglise_monolithe.jpg" title="fig:Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion." alt="Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion." width="100" /></p>
<p>During the design phase, Matsuno was shown photographs from France, particularly Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion in the region of <a href="Bordeaux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bordeaux</a>. This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-&lt;U+00C9&gt;milion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed on September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> was conceived during a time when most games had made the transition into <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">three-dimensional graphics</a>. Games with real-time <a href="polygon_(computer_graphics" title="wikilink">polygons</a> were the mainstream, and it was decided for <em>Vagrant Story</em> to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the <a href="frame_rate" title="wikilink">frame rate</a> caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="Game_demo" title="wikilink">demo</a> disk of <em>Vagrant Story</em> was included in the packaging of <em><a href="Legend_of_Mana" title="wikilink">Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana</a></em> in Japan. During the Square Millennium Event held by Square in Tokyo, movies of <em>Vagrant Story</em> such as the opening sequence and the weapon crafting system were presented to onlookers. Matsuno stated that a normal playthrough would take the player 5 to 6 hours to complete.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Vagrant Story</em> was released with two discs. The first disc is the game itself, while the second disc is a demo disc released by Square to give the player a preview of seven titles. The seven titles include three interactive demos and four non-interactive demos; the former being <em><a href="Chocobo_Racing" title="wikilink">Chocobo Racing</a></em>, <em><a href="Front_Mission_3" title="wikilink">Front Mission 3</a></em> and <em><a href="Threads_of_Fate" title="wikilink">Threads of Fate</a></em>, and the latter <em><a href="Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink">Chrono Cross</a></em>, <em><a href="SaGa_Frontier_2" title="wikilink">SaGa Frontier 2</a></em>, <em><a href="Chocobo&#39;s_Dungeon_2" title="wikilink">Chocobo's Dungeon 2</a></em> and <em><a href="Legend_of_Mana" title="wikilink">Legend of Mana</a></em>. Both discs were included in the North American release on May 15, 2000.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Three years after its release in 2000, <em>Vagrant Story</em> was selected as one of four Square's titular games to become part of <a href="Sony_Greatest_Hits" title="wikilink">Sony Greatest Hits</a>; the other three being <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_Anthology" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy Anthology</a></em>, <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_Chronicles" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a></em> and <em><a href="Xenogears" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenogears</a></em>.

IGN described the story as &quot;so deep and intuitive that it'll likely please fans&quot;, and said the battle system maintains &quot;a needed element of strategy and balance&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The comic-book graphics were seen as a breakaway from the clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s of contemporary titles.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Extensive detail was given to the background settings and character expressions.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The game's sound effects have been praised as &quot;well done and impressive, straying from Square's synthed noise&quot;,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> as details such as the background audio help create a believable world for the player.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The battle system was described by GameSpot as too complex for beginner players, as even hard-core players require a &quot;comprehensive understanding&quot; of the weapon customization system.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> IGN pointed out that enemy encounters can be more difficult than boss battles.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> <em><a href="Official_U.S._PlayStation_Magazine" title="wikilink">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a></em> noted that the game's inventory was too limited for the vast number of customizations possible; this was considered particularly troublesome because some boss enemies are only vulnerable to certain types of weapons.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn20"><strong>VKP Officer</strong>: Furthermore, we must find out why the Cardinal sent his blades to deal with this incident without our approval. <a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn21"><strong>Rosencrantz</strong>: We were always the champions of justice, true, but a justice hat served the state alone. <a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn22"><strong>Ashley</strong>: An agent with no combat experience would just be a liability. <a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn23"><strong>Ashley</strong>: Are cults not the Templars' concern? <a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn24"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: Grissom, gather our remaining men. Join with Tieger's knights, and crush M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp. Go! / <strong>Grissom</strong>: By your command. <a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn25"><strong>Rosencrantz</strong>: However, Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde has strong ties to the Dark, for this is the Dark city of the ancient Kildean priestess M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp.<a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn26"><strong>Narrator</strong>:At its height, Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde was a thriving community more than 5,000 people strong. Twenty-five years ago, a great earthquake brought that chapter in Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde's history to a close.<a href="#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn27"><strong>VKP Officer</strong>: Our Inquisitors have found that M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp's coin comes from the captive duke himself. <a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn28"></li>
<li id="fn29"><strong>Ashley</strong>: What's going on? You were most certainly dead! Leave the back-from-the-grave stuff to faerie tales... <a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn30"><strong>Duke Bardorba</strong>: The fool Sydney used his wyvern. We can't have witnesses telling the world, can we? <a href="#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn31"><strong>Sydney</strong>: I...I'm the one you want. Hardin...go quickly...go...to Le&lt;U+00E1&gt; Monde. <a href="#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn32"><strong>Crimson Blade</strong>: ...with a Grimoire, your fattest sow could outfly my swiftest falcon - if ye believe the chroniclers. <a href="#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn33"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: Trapped in purgation, they yearn for life. Thus they seek bodies without souls...and the &quot;corpses that walk&quot; are born. <a href="#fnref33" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn34"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: There is one who has found the true undeath. Immortality, my love. <a href="#fnref34" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn35"><strong>Ashley</strong>: You must know, Riskbreakers always work alone. And a change of plans mid-mission is unthinkable. <a href="#fnref35" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn36"><strong>Sydney</strong>: You were an assassin and a saboteur in an elite squad. Mistaking them for your target, you murdered an innocent family. For country and justice you would take any life without thinking, until you sent that family to their deaths. The VKP saw the opportunity to turn your guilt to patriotic zeal. They twisted your very soul, Ashley. <a href="#fnref36" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn37"><strong>Hardin</strong>: Were the duke's betrayal, the cardinal's meddling...and a Riskbreaker strong as a bloody titan all part of your precious plan, too, Sydney? <a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn38"><strong>Hardin</strong>: As I can scrye on distant locales, so the talent of the heart-seers has flowered in you. <a href="#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn39"><strong>Hardin</strong>: The key-bearer, the duke, will soon die. If he dies without a successor, all is lost. The duke thinks he can cut off the cursed M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llenkamp bloodline, but that must not be allowed to happen. We will assume the legacy. <a href="#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn40"><strong>Hardin</strong>: There was an investigation into an incident. I was part of a special team, entrusted with delivering blades to rebels in a neighboring kingdom. Apparently, some did not reach their destination. They claimed some of us were making coppers selling the steel on the black market. ...We were all guilty, I was not the only one. They presented me with an offer. Betray my friends, and I would walk free.<a href="#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn41"><strong>Hardin</strong>: ...I had a brother, half my age. He was gravely ill, and we knew not when he would leave us. I wanted money...I wanted my freedom. I sold my friend, my brother. But they did not set me free. When I escaped from prison, my brother was dead.<a href="#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn42"><strong>Sydney</strong>: I give you the city, Riskbreaker! All its power - all to you! Make haste! Join me! Already, your powers are close to readiness! Come! <a href="#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn43"><strong>Ashley</strong>: Keep your accursed city! Where's Merlose!? <a href="#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn44"><strong>Samantha</strong>: The Gran Grimoire...the ultimate codex of sorcery. <a href="#fnref44" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn45"><strong>Rosencrantz</strong>: It is time. I will carry on the legacy in your name. Now, the rites! Name me your successor!! <a href="#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn46"><strong>Rosencrantz</strong>: This...This is your &quot;successor&quot;? Open your eyes, Sydney. I am the one! <a href="#fnref46" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn47"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: The Blood-Sin, you say? It has a familiar ring... Years past, during the Inquisition of the heretics, the &quot;Rood Inverse&quot; was carved on them, an abjuration of the flesh... Those who bore this tattoo called it the Blood-Sin. <a href="#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn48"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: Good God! Sydney held the key all along! The tattoo on his back, it is the Blood-Sin! He has the key! He has played you false! <a href="#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn49"><strong>Guildenstern</strong>: ...the nobility! They do nothing and blame others for their failure; they steal men's dreams and twist them to nightmares...We must cleanse this corruption. There must be strong, unwavering justice. And there must be fear to enforce that justice. <a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn50"><strong>Sydney</strong>: I wanted to help father, as he helped me when I was born. He wanted the city destroyed, even if it meant his own death. Then, he implored me. <a href="#fnref50" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
