<p><img src="MarloChristmas.jpg" title="fig:MarloChristmas.jpg" alt="MarloChristmas.jpg" /><strong><em>It Happened One Christmas</em></strong> is a 1977 made-for-television movie starring <a href="Marlo_Thomas" title="wikilink">Marlo Thomas</a> and <a href="Wayne_Rogers" title="wikilink">Wayne Rogers</a>.</p>
<p>The film, a gender-reversal remake of the classic <em><a href="It&#39;s_a_Wonderful_Life" title="wikilink">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em>, centers on Mary Bailey Hatch, a young woman who dreams of seeing the world but is forced by circumstances to remain in her small hometown as head of the family's Building &amp; Loan business. In a moment of financial crisis, a severely depressed Mary contemplates <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> but is rescued by her <a href="guardian_angel" title="wikilink">guardian angel</a>, Clara Oddbody, who shows her the positive effect she's had on everyone she's met throughout her life.</p>
<p><a href="Lionel_Chetwynd" title="wikilink">Lionel Chetwynd</a>'s teleplay, directed by <a href="Donald_Wrye" title="wikilink">Donald Wrye</a>, varies little from the original screenplay, even using most of the original dialogue. The supporting cast includes <a href="Orson_Welles" title="wikilink">Orson Welles</a>, <a href="Cloris_Leachman" title="wikilink">Cloris Leachman</a>, <a href="Doris_Roberts" title="wikilink">Doris Roberts</a>, <a href="Christopher_Guest" title="wikilink">Christopher Guest</a>, <a href="C._Thomas_Howell" title="wikilink">C. Thomas Howell</a>, and <a href="Barney_Martin" title="wikilink">Barney Martin</a>.</p>
<p>Leachman received an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy Award</a> nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama or Comedy Special.</p>
<p>Thomas served as executive producer for the project. The remake was broadcast at a time when the original film rarely was aired on television, and many viewers were unfamiliar with its source. Once the <a href="James_Stewart_(actor)" title="wikilink">James Stewart</a>-<a href="Donna_Reed" title="wikilink">Donna Reed</a> version returned to the airwaves on an annual basis, the remake slipped into obscurity.</p>
<p>The film had its premiere on Sunday, December 11, 1977, and was one of the very rare instances when the <em><a href="ABC_Sunday_Night_Movie" title="wikilink">ABC Sunday Night Movie</a></em> showcased a <a href="made-for-television" class="uri" title="wikilink">made-for-television</a> film rather than one that had been shown in theatres. It was successful enough to be re-broadcast in 1978, but by that time, the original <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em> had begun its &quot;resurgence&quot; on television, and eventually displaced <em>It Happened One Christmas</em>.</p>
<p><em>It Happened One Christmas</em> is rarely shown today, and has not, as of 2009, been issued on DVD.</p>
