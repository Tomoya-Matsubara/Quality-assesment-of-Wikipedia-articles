<p><strong>Phi Delta Theta</strong> (<strong>&lt;U+03A6&gt;&lt;U+0394&gt;&lt;U+0398&gt;</strong>) is an international <a href="Fraternities_and_sororities" title="wikilink">fraternity</a> founded in 1848 at <a href="Miami_University" title="wikilink">Miami University</a> in <a href="Oxford,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Oxford, Ohio</a>.

<p>A year later, after the president expelled most of the students involved in the uprising, Phi Delta Theta was formed. Six men staying in a dormitory the day after Christmas formed the Greek-letter society. Robert Morrison, a senior, proposed to fellow classmate John McMillan Wilson that they bond together to form a secret society. They invited juniors Robert Thompson Drake and John Wolfe Lindley and sophomores Ardivan Walker Rodgers and Andrew Watts Rogers into the fold. These men are known today as &quot;The Immortal Six&quot;. The first meeting was held in Wilson's room at Old North Hall, now called Elliot Hall. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>During the early meetings, the Founders wrote The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, which is the fundamental law of the Fraternity. It has remained unchanged ever since, and so far as is known, it is believed to be the only document of any fraternity of such a character. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Morrison designed the shield form of the badge, with the eye as an emblem, while Wilson suggested the scroll with the Greek letters on it. The first branch of Phi Delta Theta was founded at <a href="Indiana_University_Bloomington" title="wikilink">Indiana University</a> in 1849. The activities of the fraternity was <em><a href="sub_rosa" title="wikilink">sub rosa</a></em> for its first three years of existence fearing punishment from the university. Eventually as the organization attracted new individuals into their membership including prominent university officials, members began to openly wear their badges indicating their affiliation.</p>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>Phi Delta Theta held its first convention in <a href="1851" class="uri" title="wikilink">1851</a> in <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a> when the organization only had four chapters. The event was attended by seven members. Despite the limited number, positive steps were taken for the establishment of new chapters by forming an expansion committee. It was also during the first convention where the chapter at Miami University was designated as the Grand Chapter whose duties were to oversee the overall fraternity operations. Subsequent conventions were held again in Cincinnati five years later; <a href="Bloomington,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Bloomington, Indiana</a> in 1858; and <a href="Danville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Danville, Kentucky</a> in 1860. Another convention was held in 1864 in Bloomington during the Civil War. <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">The War Between the States</a> was difficult for all fraternities. Battles put fraternity brother against fraternity brother. 231 Phis fought for the <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a> while 50 Phis fought on the side of the <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederacy</a> <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>It was not until the 1868 Indianapolis convention that the first steps in the creation of an overall <a href="Administration_(business)" title="wikilink">administration</a> took place. The convention was regarded as the first &quot;National Convention&quot; because it was during this time when permanent convention rules were adopted. Twelve years later, the most important of all Phi Delta Theta conventions took place. The Indianapolis Convention of 1880 established new ritual, insignia, and customs that are still used today. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, the convention saw the creation of the General Council, the governing body of the fraternity, with Walter B. Palmer, <em>Emory-Vanderbilt 1877</em>, and <a href="George_Banta" title="wikilink">George Banta</a>, <em>Franklin-Indiana 1876</em>, becoming the president and historian, respectively. The convention also called for the organization of groups of chapters into provinces which were to be headed by province presidents.</p>
<p>A housing movement began to form during this time. The movement arose out of necessity because it was pointed out that chapter meetings were being conducted in rented halls. Even though the housing movement had been gaining momentum, it wasn't until the 1892 convention where a resolution was passed which advocated that all chapters at least rent a house or own one. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the last two decades of the 19th century over 50 chapter houses were acquired.</p>
<p>For a brief period a resolution was set forth to allow chapters to initiate women. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>First proposed in 1869, this was considered a radical idea both from a fraternal standpoint and social one as well since <a href="suffrage" title="wikilink">women were not allowed to vote</a> until <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Though it was met with strong opposition, the issue would not be settled for a number of years.</p>
<p>During the two decades from 1870 to 1890, the growth of the fraternity was rapid, due principally to the efforts of Palmer and Banta. The two were given the title &lt;U+201C&gt;Second Founders&lt;U+201D&gt; for their work. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <img src="50th_Anniversary_(PDT).jpg" title="fig:50th Anniversary of Phi Delta Theta with Founders Morrison and Lindley in the fore front. From the 1898 Convention." alt="50th Anniversary of Phi Delta Theta with Founders Morrison and Lindley in the fore front. From the 1898 Convention." width="300" /> In the 1870s alone, 34 new chapters were established, but this was also a period of uncertainty because of the anti-fraternity sentiment held by many faculty in schools where Phi Delta Theta had chapters. <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Several chapters became dormant because of this. The fraternity continued steady growth, and by 1889, there were 66 chapters in 27 states.</p>
<h3 id="first-half-of-the-20th-century">First half of the 20th century</h3>
<p>With constant expansion into the western United States, Phi Delta Theta became an international fraternity when the organization's first chapter in <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> was installed at <a href="McGill_University" title="wikilink">McGill University</a> in <a href="Montreal" title="wikilink">Montreal, Quebec</a> on April 5, 1902. By 1918, there were 78 chapters with a membership of 77,000.</p>
<p><img src="Phi_Delta_Theta_-_West_Point.jpg" title="fig:Members of Phi Delta Theta at West Point in 1917 prior to their deployment in the First World War|right|thumb" alt="Members of Phi Delta Theta at West Point in 1917 prior to their deployment in the First World War|right|thumb" /> At the outbreak of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, college administrators urged its undergraduate members to stay in school. However, many were eager to enlist. The first Phis to fight in the war were members of the chapters at the <a href="University_of_Toronto" title="wikilink">University of Toronto</a> and <a href="McGill_University" title="wikilink">McGill University</a>, the fraternity's only Canadian chapters during that period. By the time the United States entered the war in <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a>, over 5000 Phis served in the conflict with 155 of them losing their lives. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Since many of the undergraduate Phis put their studies on hold many chapter houses either had limited occupants or none at all. To prevent losing the house for when the Phis would return, the housing corporations consented to having the houses used as <a href="barracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">barracks</a> or for <a href="YMCA" class="uri" title="wikilink">YMCA</a> programs. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1920s and 1930s, expansion was carefully controlled. Focus was placed on re-activating chapters whose charters were revoked years earlier.</p>
<p><a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> exacted a heavy toll on the membership and operations of the fraternity. During this time, thirteen chapters were closed with many of the undergraduate members joining the various military branches. As active membership declined most of the Phi Delt houses were used as women's residence halls or became makeshift military quarters. The fraternity tried its best to keep up to date information regarding the status of its members who were fighting. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> A news letter, <em>The Fighting Phi News</em> was sent to members whose contact information was known to the fraternity.</p>
<p>Over 14,000 Phis were known to have been in uniform during the conflict. <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Of that number, over 800 were killed or <a href="missing_in_action" title="wikilink">missing in action</a>, the largest loss of any fraternity during the war.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> An additional 8,000 veterans were initiated into the fraternity in the immediate subsequent years. There were 50 Phi generals and admirals who served in the United States and Canada during the conflict, the most for any fraternity. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Prominent among them were General <a href="Edward_P._King" title="wikilink">Edward P. King</a>, leader of the U.S. and Filipino forces in <a href="Bataan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bataan</a>, Philippines, Admiral <a href="Robert_L._Ghormley" title="wikilink">Robert L. Ghormley</a>, commander of the <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a> and Admiral <a href="John_S._McCain" title="wikilink">John S. McCain</a>, commander of carrier task forces in the Pacific. Members of Phi Delta Theta also received every major military decoration in both the United States and British Commonwealth forces including the <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a> (MOH) awarded to <a href="Leon_Vance" title="wikilink">Leon Vance</a> of the <a href="Army_Air_Corps" title="wikilink">Army Air Corps</a> and the <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a> to <a href="Robert_Hampton_Gray" title="wikilink">Robert Hampton Gray</a>, a Canadian naval aviator. (VC). Vance&lt;U+2019&gt;s MOH was the last to be awarded prior to the <a href="D-Day" class="uri" title="wikilink">D-Day</a> landings while Gray was both the last military personnel to receive the VC in the war as well as being the last Canadian to lose his life during the war.  Members of the fraternity also played a crucial role on the homefront. Among those were <a href="Elmer_Davis" title="wikilink">Elmer Davis</a> the head of the <a href="Office_of_War_Information" title="wikilink">Office of War Information</a>, <a href="Byron_Price" title="wikilink">Byron Price</a> the head of the <a href="Office_of_Censorship" title="wikilink">Office of Censorship</a> and Ted Gamble, the National Director of the War Finance Division.</p>
<p>When World War II ended, the fraternity experienced a surge in membership as many veterans attended college under the <a href="GI_Bill" title="wikilink">GI Bill</a>. On <a href="December_15" title="wikilink">December 15</a>, <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a> the groundbreaking of the present day General Headquarters building took place. One of the features of the headquarters was a permanent war memorial honoring all Phis who lost their lives not only in WWII but previous wars as well.</p>
<h3 id="second-half-of-the-20th-century">Second half of the 20th century</h3>
<p>After the end of World War II the fraternity was confronted with the social changes sweeping college campuses in the United states; mainly civil rights and discrimination. Like many fraternities, Phi Delta Theta had a restrictive clause barring membership to <a href="African-Americans" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-Americans</a>, <a href="Asians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asians</a>, <a href="Jews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jews</a>, and <a href="Muslims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Specifically the term &quot;white persons of full aryan blood&quot; was the subject of strong opposition among many members in light of Nazi ideology in the recently fought war although there had been dissenting voices regarding this long before the clause became controversial among its members. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This clause was added to the Code of Phi Delta Theta in 1910. However, by the 1946 convention there was an open discussion regarding this topic. Impassioned sentiment from many alumni as well as undergraduates coupled with the changing demographic of the college scene caused Phi Delta Theta to re-examine its membership. Years of debate continued, however by 1954 Phi Delta Theta eliminated the clause and became one of the first fraternities to eliminate any reference to race, color, or creed. <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Only a year earlier, Phi Delta Theta suspended its chapters from <a href="Amherst_College" title="wikilink">Amherst</a> and <a href="Williams_College" title="wikilink">Williams College</a> for pledging minorities. <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1950s saw a period of rapid growth and an expansion of the internal operations of the fraternity. During the decade 12 new schools were granted chapter status. An important change in leadership also occurred during this time. In 1955, Paul Beam, the Executive Vice President of the Fraternity (the head of the fraternity's daily operations) unexpectedly died. He had succeeded the position from Arthur R. Priest who had served in from 1923-37. Beam guided the fraternity through eight conventions and through the trials of World War II. Bob Miller, who was Beam's assistant, was eventually chosen to take over by the General Council and assumed the office almost immediately. He would go on to serve for 36 years, which is currently the longest term served in that office.</p>
<p>Two important programs were developed during this period which would profoundly affect the fraternity's services. Before Beam died he and several province presidents proposed a leadership convention for undergraduate members. These conventions would cover topics ranging from chapter organization to effective leadership. The first such convention was set up in <a href="1956" class="uri" title="wikilink">1956</a>. At the time, it only involved 16 chapters. From 1956 until 1987 these sessions were held on a regional basis. The gatherings would form the basis of the Leadership College founded in 1987. 1958 was an important year for the fraternity as they saw the creation of an educational foundation. The main purpose of the foundation was to provide scholarships to deserving students.</p>

<p>During the turbulent times of the 1960s, Phi Delta Theta along with other social fraternities, had to deal with strong anti-fraternity sentiment from people who saw the Greek lettered communities as old world established institutions. <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>Despite overall decline in fraternity membership in the late 60s, Phi Delta Theta continued to expand in to various campuses. However, this time expansion was carefully controlled through a process called &quot;colonization&quot;. In 1968, a historic initiation took place when <a href="Robert_Wise" title="wikilink">Robert Wise</a>, <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> winning director of the <em><a href="Sound_of_Music" title="wikilink">Sound of Music</a></em> and <em><a href="West_Side_Story" title="wikilink">West Side Story</a></em> was initiated in the <a href="Franklin_College" title="wikilink">Franklin College</a> chapter. Wise had completed all membership requirements in 1932 but was forced to withdraw from college due to lack of funds. <a href="Roger_D._Branigin" title="wikilink">Roger D. Branigin</a>, the current <a href="Governor_of_Indiana" title="wikilink">Governor of Indiana</a> at the time and Phi Delt member presided over the ceremonies. 1969 was an eventful year for the fraternity as Neil Armstrong, a graduate from the <a href="Purdue_University" title="wikilink">Purdue University</a> chapter, became the first man to walk on the moon. During this event, Armstrong carried with him a fraternity badge which he subsequently donated to the General Headquarters of the fraternity. <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He also donated a small silk flag of the fraternity which he carried with him on his <a href="Project_Gemini" title="wikilink">Gemini</a> flight in 1966. <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>As war raged in Vietnam, Phis would again serve in the armed forces. With the emergence of new technology, a significant percentage opted to become fighter pilots. The <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> saw a small dip in the Fraternity's membership; however, by 1972, the fraternity had 140 active chapters with over 128,000 initiates. An important change was made during the 70s which gave more autonomy to chapters in terms of membership selection. An amendment was passed wherein the unanimous vote rule to allow a college man to become a pledge was changed to allow individual chapters to decide on their own what method best suited their respective chapters. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1973, the fraternity celebrated its 125th anniversary. The special occasion was marked by the construction of the University gates at Miami University. To date, there are 9 buildings on the campus which were either constructed by Phi Delta Theta or named after members. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1980s saw the fraternity deal with issues such as hazing, rising insurance costs and maintenance of individual chapter operations. The unofficial theme of the 1980 convention was &lt;U+201C&gt;Eliminate Hazing&lt;U+201D&gt;. The decade was marked by an increase of lawsuits dealing with hazing and alcohol abuse among many fraternities. <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> To deal with this issue, Phi Delta Theta instituted a comprehensive insurance policy to protect its chapters. It was during the 1980s where an important aspect of the fraternity was created: Leadership consultants. The consultants, who are recent college graduates, would travel to assigned provinces and assist various chapters in many aspects of fraternity life and chapter operations. They would also report the status of each visited chapter to GHQ.</p>
<p>An important leadership changed occurred in the beginning of the 90s when Robert Biggs became the 4th Executive Vice President of the fraternity after Robert Miller stepped down. The most important policy to be implemented by the fraternity during the decade was the decision made in 1997 to have all chapter facilities alcohol free by the year 2000. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>It was an initiative that was strongly pursued by the 1996-98 General Council. The policy was in response to the growing insurance claims against the fraternity, 53% of which were alcohol related, and a return to the core values of the organization. <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="governing-bodies">Governing bodies</h2>
<p>All powers of the fraternity, both legislative and supreme, rests within the General Convention, a biannual event where undergraduate chapters, alumni chapters as well as representatives from the various educational foundations are in attendance to discuss and vote on a wide range of issues affecting the fraternity. <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>The convention is held in various cities across North America. It is also during the convention where the General Council is elected.</p>
<p>The General Council is the governing body of Phi Delta Theta. It is an all volunteer organization in which members are elected every two years during the fraternity&lt;U+2019&gt;s convention. Their chief responsibility is to act as the executive and administrative board of the fraternity. <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Among their duties include the granting of charters.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters (GHQ) is responsible for the daily operations of the fraternity. They collect dues, distribute supplies and tries to keep up to date information of all its members among other duties. Unlike other entities within the fraternity, the staff of GHQ are paid for their services. While the main offices of GHQ are held by members of the fraternity, support staff need not be members. The head of GHQ is the Executive Vice President, who acts as the secretary to the General Council.</p>
<h2 id="educational-foundation-and-programs">Educational foundation and programs</h2>
<p>Phi Delta Theta along with many other fraternities has an educational foundation fund. Part of the foundation's aim is to award scholarships to deserving undergraduate members and those pursuing advanced degrees in various graduate schools. Each year, it provides over $150,000 in scholarships. <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The foundation is also essential in supporting various programs such as the Emerging Leadership Institute, the Leadership Consultant Program, and portions of the General Convention as well as the Scroll, the official magazine of the fraternity. The foundation, which was established in 1962 with only $4,708, has since grown to over $14 million.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-accolade">The Accolade</h3>
<p>In 2004, the fraternity began a member development program for undergraduates called <em>The Accolade</em>. It is designed to enhance a member's collegiate and overall fraternity experience. Some of the program's personal development activities include goal-setting, time management, and career development. Although the program is intended for new undergraduate members, it is available to all members including senior members and alumni. Though Phi Delta Theta is no longer part of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, the Fraternity was recognized by the conference for the <em>'Best Use of a Foundation Grant</em> for its support of The Accolade. <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="emerging-leadership-institute">Emerging Leadership Institute</h3>
<p>The Emerging Leadership Institute (ELI) is an annual event held at the Fraternity's headquarters during the summer where newly initiated undergraduates are given instruction in various leadership classes as well as participating in programs that help to improve their respective chapters. It is attended by selected undergraduates from every chapter. It is mainly geared toward newly initiated members. The Institute was established after the Leadership College was dissolved.</p>
<h3 id="philanthropy">Philanthropy</h3>
<p>For many years, Phi Delta Theta had no <em>official</em> philanthropy. The Fraternity, however, was long associated with the Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association (ALSA) because of <a href="Lou_Gehrig" title="wikilink">Lou Gehrig</a>, an alumnus who died of the disease. <a href="Motor_neurone_disease" title="wikilink">Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a> (ALS) is a deabilitating neuro-muscular disease and has since become known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Though there had always existed a relationship between ALSA and Phi Delta Theta, it was not until November 2002 when the General Council made the partnership official. <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>Undergraduate as well as alumni chapters from all across North America regularly organize various events raising money for research.</p>
<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<h3 id="the-scroll">The Scroll</h3>
<p>The Scroll of Phi Delta Theta is the official magazine for members of the fraternity. The award winning magazine has been continuously published since 1875. It is the second oldest continuously published fraternity magazine behind that of the official magazine of Beta Theta Pi which was first published 3 years before. <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Members receive lifetime subscriptions to The Scroll. The magazine covers various topics such as current issues relating both to Phi Delta Theta and the fraternity world, news of prominent alumni, alumni club meeting reports and undergraduate chapter reports. Although the magazine is related to Phi Delta Theta interests, readership is open to non-members. Since its inception, issues have been published 2- 4 times a year.</p>

</center>
<h3 id="the-palladium">The Palladium</h3>
<p>The Palladium was the private magazine specifically for members of Phi Delta Theta. Unlike The Scroll, the Palladium was intended to be read by Phis only. The magazine covered topics such as fraternity policy, reports and minutes to any conventions. It was published only once a year and was a supplement to the Winter edition of The Scroll. The first issue was printed in 1894 and the last issue was released in the mid 1960s.</p>
<h3 id="the-pledge-manual">The pledge manual</h3>
<p>The first three pledge manuals of the fraternity were written by Walter B. Palmer. The idea for the manual was conceived by J. Marshall Mayer, <em>City College of New York 1884</em> who at the time was the managing editor of the Scroll. The first pledge manual was printed in 1886 and contained only 56 pages. Since very few copies were published and it is the first membership manual of any fraternity, it is regarded as one of the most rare and valuable books if its kind. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The 4th-6th editions were authored by Arthur R. Priest. Much of the present day material is derived from these editions.</p>

<h2 id="role-in-the-fraternity-world">Role in the fraternity world</h2>
<p>Phi Delta Theta has played an important role in the fraternity movement. Chiefly among these was being a founding member of the North-American Interfraternity Conference which was established in <a href="1910" class="uri" title="wikilink">1910</a> (an organization which they subsequently left in 2002) and leading the initiative to ban alcohol from Phi Delt houses. Throughout their history, the fraternity became a pioneer in establishing traditions as well as having individual members shape the formation of similar women's organizations. The fraternity has also been the first fraternity to establish itself on over 25 campuses. <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="historical-ties-with-sororities">Historical ties with sororities</h3>
<p>Even though Phi Delta Theta technically does not have a sister sorority, it has the distinction of having close connections with two sororities: <a href="Delta_Gamma" title="wikilink">Delta Gamma</a> and <a href="Delta_Zeta" title="wikilink">Delta Zeta</a>. <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> George Banta Sr., a Phi Delt from Franklin-Indiana, was instrumental in helping to expand the Delta Gamma sorority. For his efforts, he was the only man ever initiated into Delta Gamma. <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Banta would later perform initiation ceremonies for new members of the sorority, including that of Lillian Vawter, his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. <a href="Guy_Potter_Benton" title="wikilink">Guy Potter Benton</a>, a graduate of the Phi Delt chapter at <a href="Ohio_Wesleyan_University" title="wikilink">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>, was president of Miami University in 1902 when he helped with the founding of Delta Zeta. Dr. Benton aided in the preparation of a ritual, badge, and colors. <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was a great assistance to Delta Zeta and at one point chased down a man who stole the newly formed ritual of the sorority. For his work, Delta Zeta named him the Grand Patron of the sorority and is the only man to ever wear the Delta Zeta badge. To this day, an amiable friendship exists between Phi Delta Theta and these two sororities. <ref name="DG"> <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="famous-firsts">Famous firsts</h3>
<p>Phi Delta Theta instituted several policies and traditions which are not only still used by the fraternity today but has also has become standards among almost all fraternities as well as sororities. <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="north-american-interfraternity-conference-nic">North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC)</h3>
<p>In 2002, Phi Delta Theta, along with <a href="Kappa_Sigma" title="wikilink">Kappa Sigma</a> and <a href="Phi_Sigma_Kappa" title="wikilink">Phi Sigma Kappa</a> left the <a href="North-American_Interfraternity_Conference" title="wikilink">North-American Interfraternity Conference</a> due to ideological differences. <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Fraternity officials had been concerned of the direction of the conference for six years prior to leaving. Phi Delta Theta officials believed that the conference had been placing too much emphasis on individual undergraduates through specific programs such as leadership conferences rather than focusing on the fraternity movement as a whole. <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="alcohol-free-housing-policy">Alcohol free housing policy</h3>
<p>In 1997, Phi Delta Theta spearheaded the initiative of having alcohol free housing within its chapters by the year 2000. <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The policy has since been adopted by other fraternities including <a href="Theta_Chi" title="wikilink">Theta Chi</a> and <a href="Phi_Gamma_Delta" title="wikilink">Phi Gamma Delta</a> (FIJI). <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="concern-and-criticism">Concern and criticism</h4>
<p>When Phi Delta Theta announced the inception of an alcohol free housing policy, the announcement was met both by hope and skepticism. While some viewed that the ban of alcohol in housing facilities was a welcome return to the founding principles of the fraternity, others felt that it would hurt social dynamics because of the drastic cultural shift. The General Council and GHQ had expected resistance from both alumni and undergraduate members when it was first proposed. <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Among the most vocal chapters against the policy was the <a href="University_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">University of Virginia</a> chapter who chose to form a separate local fraternity known as the Phi Society, rather than adopt the policy. <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="alcohol-free-housing-five-year-progress-report">Alcohol Free Housing Five Year Progress Report</h4>
<p>In 2005, the fraternity issued a progress report. There have been significant improvements in many areas of fraternity life and operations. Since the implementation of the Alcohol-free Housing Policy, the all undergraduate grade point average rose from a 2.77 in 2000 to nearly a 3.00 in 2005. The insurance premiums of individual members have also gone down as risk management violations have decreased. Perhaps the most telling area is in membership, where Phi Delta Theta showed an increase of new members. In 2004, Phi Delta Theta had 3,102 new members while other fraternities averaged 2,415. In 1990, chapters of Phi Delta Theta were 18% larger than the typical fraternity chapter. In 2004, they were 30% larger. Also, in 2004, Phi Delta Theta was one of only 13 national/international fraternities to show an increase in total undergraduates from the previous year with an increase of 4.2%. The significance of this is highlighted by that fact that Phi Delta Theta had fewer chapters than other fraternities. Competitively, Phi Delta Theta has remained a constant among others. In terms of new members, it ranked ninth in 1990, eighth in 2000, and ninth in 2004. Many alumni members have credited the alcohol free housing policy in continuing this trend.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>
<p>Membership to Phi Delta Theta is open to all qualified men without concern for race, religion or ethnicity. Initial membership to the fraternity is contingent upon receiving an invitation to an interested individual by members of an active chapter. A pledge of Phi Delta Theta is called a <em>Phikiea</em>. The typical pledge period calls for a minimum of 8 weeks although on occasion can be shortened or lengthened depending on the university requirement or with the approval of the General Council. <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The pledge period is a time where the prospective member learns about the fraternity history, structure, traditions, organization as well as social etiquette. Phi Delta Theta has a strict policy against <a href="hazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">hazing</a> and does not tolerate chapters who violate the policy. <a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Once a person is initiated, he is entitled to all the rights and privileges entitled to him as a member of the fraternity unless he formally resigns or is expelled. <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>Members of Phi Delta Theta have held every major political position in the United States including the presidency, vice-presidency and Speaker of the House. In Canada, they have served in many levels of government. Members have won every major award in entertainment and have also gained prominence in areas such as architecture, medicine and sports. Throughout the years, many prominent members have kept a vested interest in the events and operations of Phi Delta Theta. President Harrison, for example, participated in three Phi Delt banquets during his presidency while Medal of Honor recipient General <a href="Frederick_Funston" title="wikilink">Frederick Funston</a> was the guest speaker at certain chapter installations. <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Since 1848 nearly 260 charters have been granted across The United States and Canada. Today, there are over 165 chapters and colonies. In order to be granted a charter, a colony must complete certain requirements set forth by the General Council.
