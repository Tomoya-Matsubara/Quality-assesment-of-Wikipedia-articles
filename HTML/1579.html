It tells the story of the over-protective <a href="Amphiprion_ocellaris" title="wikilink">clownfish</a> named Marlin (<a href="Albert_Brooks" title="wikilink">Albert Brooks</a>) who, along with a <a href="Paracanthurus_hepatus" title="wikilink">regal tang</a> named Dory (<a href="Ellen_DeGeneres" title="wikilink">Ellen DeGeneres</a>), searches for his abducted son Nemo (<a href="Alexander_Gould" title="wikilink">Alexander Gould</a>) all the way to <a href="Sydney_Harbour" title="wikilink">Sydney Harbour</a>. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and let Nemo take care of himself.</p>
<p>It is Pixar's first film to be released in <a href="movie_theatre" title="wikilink">cinemas</a> in the northern hemisphere summer. The film was re-released for the first time in <a href="3D_film" title="wikilink">3D</a> on September 14, 2012, and it was released on <a href="Blu-ray_Disc" title="wikilink">Blu-ray</a> on December 4, 2012. A <a href="#Sequel" title="wikilink">sequel</a>, <em><a href="Finding_Dory" title="wikilink">Finding Dory</a></em>, is in development, set to be released on June 17, 2016.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The film received widespread critical acclaim, won the <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature" title="wikilink">Academy Award for Best Animated Feature</a>, and was nominated in three more categories including <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay" title="wikilink">Best Original Screenplay</a>.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Two <a href="ocellaris_clownfish" title="wikilink">ocellaris clownfish</a>, Marlin and his wife Coral, are admiring their new home in the <a href="Great_Barrier_Reef" title="wikilink">Great Barrier Reef</a> and their clutch of eggs. An <a href="Australian_barracuda" title="wikilink">Australian barracuda</a> attacks them, leaving Marlin unconscious. He wakes up to find Coral and all but one of the eggs missing. Marlin names this last egg Nemo, a name that Coral liked.</p>
<p>Nemo develops a small right fin due to damage to his egg from the attack, which limits his swimming ability. After Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip, Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers. As the boat departs, one of the divers accidentally knocks his <a href="diving_mask" title="wikilink">diving mask</a> overboard.</p>
<p>While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic <a href="Paracanthurus_hepatus" title="wikilink">regal blue tang</a> with <a href="Anterograde_amnesia" title="wikilink">short-term memory loss</a>. Marlin and Dory encounter three <a href="shark" title="wikilink">sharks</a>: Bruce, Anchor and Chum. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the scent of blood causes Bruce to enter a <a href="feeding_frenzy" title="wikilink">feeding frenzy</a>. Marlin and Dory escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the <a href="deep_sea" title="wikilink">deep sea</a>.</p>
<p>During a hazardous struggle with an <a href="anglerfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">anglerfish</a> in the trench, Dory sees the diving mask and reads the address located in <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. After receiving directions to Sydney from a <a href="Shoaling_and_schooling" title="wikilink">school</a> of <a href="Silver_moony" title="wikilink">moonfish</a>, Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of <a href="Chrysaora_quinquecirrha" title="wikilink">jellyfish</a> that nearly kills them. Marlin loses consciousness and wakes up to see a <a href="Green_sea_turtle" title="wikilink">sea turtle</a> named Crush, who takes Dory and him on the <a href="East_Australian_Current" title="wikilink">East Australian Current</a>. Marlin shares the details of his journey with a group of young sea turtles, his story is spread across the ocean, and he finds Nemo in Sydney.</p>
<p>Nemo's captor - P. Sherman, a dentist - places him in a fish tank in his office on <a href="Sydney_Harbour" title="wikilink">Sydney Harbour</a>. Nemo meets aquarium fish called the Tank Gang, led by a <a href="moorish_idol" title="wikilink">moorish idol</a> named Gill, who has a broken fin. The Tank Gang includes Bloat, a <a href="Tetraodontidae" title="wikilink">puffer fish</a>; Bubbles, a <a href="yellow_tang" title="wikilink">yellow tang</a>; Peach, an <a href="Pisaster_ochraceus" title="wikilink">ochre starfish</a>; Gurgle, a <a href="royal_gramma" title="wikilink">royal gramma</a>; Jacques, a <a href="Lysmata_amboinensis" title="wikilink">pacific cleaner shrimp</a>; and Deb, a <a href="Dascyllus_melanurus" title="wikilink">blacktailed humbug</a>.</p>
<p>The fish learn that Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who once killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill reveals his escape plan, which involves jamming the tank's <a href="Filter_(aquarium)" title="wikilink">filter</a>, forcing the dentist to remove the fish in order to clean it. The fish would be placed in plastic bags, and they would roll out the window and into the harbor. After a <a href="brown_pelican" title="wikilink">brown pelican</a> named Nigel brings news of Marlin's adventure, Nemo jams the filter, but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the East Australian Current, Marlin and Dory are engulfed by a <a href="blue_whale" title="wikilink">blue whale</a>. Inside the whale's mouth, Dory communicates with the whale, which carries them to <a href="Port_Jackson" title="wikilink">Port Jackson</a> and expels them through his blowhole. They are met by Nigel, who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and takes them to the dentist's office. Darla has arrived and the dentist is giving Nemo to her. Nemo tries to play dead to save himself as Nigel arrives. Marlin sees Nemo and believes he is dead. Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain.</p>
<p>In despair, Marlin leaves Dory and begins swimming home. Dory loses her memory and becomes confused, but meets Nemo, who has reached the ocean. Dory's memory is restored after she reads the word &quot;Sydney&quot; on a nearby drainpipe. She guides Nemo to Marlin. After they reunite, Dory is caught in a fishing net with a school of <a href="grouper" class="uri" title="wikilink">grouper</a>. Nemo enters the net and directs the group to swim downward to break the net, enabling them to escape. After returning home, Nemo leaves for school and Marlin, no longer overprotective, watches Nemo swim away with Dory at his side.</p>
<p>At the dentist's office, the high-tech filter breaks down and the Tank Gang escapes into the harbor, belatedly realizing they are still confined in the bags of water.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences,going back to when director <a href="Andrew_Stanton" title="wikilink">Andrew Stanton</a> was a child, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to <a href="Six_Flags_Discovery_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Six Flags Discovery Kingdom</a> (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was over protecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="National_Geographic_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>National Geographic</em> magazine</a>, he said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an <a href="Sea_anemone" title="wikilink">anemone</a>:</p>

<p>In addition, clownfish are very colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone very often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of <em><a href="A_Bug&#39;s_Life" title="wikilink">A Bug's Life</a></em>. As a result, <em>Finding Nemo</em> began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director <a href="Lee_Unkrich" title="wikilink">Lee Unkrich</a> called &quot;very unusual for an animated film&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The artists took <a href="scuba_diving" title="wikilink">scuba diving</a> lessons in order to study the coral reef.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Pixar_team_66&lt;U+00E8&gt;me_Festival_de_Venise_(Mostra)_2_cropped.jpg" title="fig:Andrew Stanton co-wrote and directed the film." alt="Andrew Stanton co-wrote and directed the film." /> The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and <a href="Bob_Peterson_(animator)" title="wikilink">Bob Peterson</a> while they were driving to record the actors. <a href="Ellen_DeGeneres" title="wikilink">Ellen DeGeneres</a> was cast after Stanton watched <em><a href="Ellen_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Ellen</a></em> with his wife and saw Ellen &quot;change the subject five times before finishing one sentence&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and <a href="wikt:fastidious" title="wikilink">fastidious</a> and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's <a href="Animatics" title="wikilink">story reel</a>, and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in co-director Lee Unkrich's office.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director <a href="Brad_Bird" title="wikilink">Brad Bird</a>. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was &quot;this generation's <a href="Thumper_(Bambi)" title="wikilink">Thumper</a>&quot; and immediately cast Nicholas.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Megan_Mullally" title="wikilink">Megan Mullally</a> was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character <a href="Karen_Walker_(Will_&amp;_Grace)" title="wikilink">Karen Walker</a> on the television show <em><a href="Will_&amp;_Grace" title="wikilink">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an <a href="ichthyologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">ichthyologist</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The film was dedicated to <a href="Glenn_McQueen" title="wikilink">Glenn McQueen</a>, a Pixar animator who died of <a href="melanoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">melanoma</a> in October 2002.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <em>Finding Nemo</em> shares many plot elements with <em><a href="Pierrot_the_Clownfish" title="wikilink">Pierrot the Clownfish</a></em>, a children's book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="video-game">Video game</h2>

<p>A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for <a href="Personal_computer" title="wikilink">PC</a>, <a href="Xbox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xbox</a>, <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PS2</a>, <a href="GameCube" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameCube</a> and <a href="Game_Boy_Advance" title="wikilink">GBA</a>. The goal of the game is to complete different levels under the roles of film protagonists Nemo, Marlin or Dory. It includes cutscenes from the movie, and each clip is based on a level. It was also the last Disney/Pixar game developed by <a href="Traveller&#39;s_Tales" title="wikilink">Traveller's Tales</a>. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
