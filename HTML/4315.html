<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Mossad was formed on December 13, 1949 as the &quot;Central Institute for Coordination&quot; at the recommendation of <a href="Reuven_Shiloah" title="wikilink">Reuven Shiloah</a> to Prime Minister <a href="David_Ben-Gurion" title="wikilink">David Ben-Gurion</a>. Shiloah wanted a central body to coordinate and improve cooperation between the existing security services &lt;U+2013&gt; the army's intelligence department (AMAN), the General Security Service (GSS or &quot;Shin Bet&quot;) and the foreign office's &quot;political department&quot;. In March 1951, it was reorganized and made a part of the prime minister's office, reporting directly to the prime minister.</p>
<p>Mossad's former motto: be-tachb&lt;U+016B&gt;l&lt;U+014D&gt;t ta`aseh lekh&lt;U+0101&gt; milch&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+0101&gt;h (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; &lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05DA&gt; &lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;) is a quote from the Bible (Proverbs 24:6): &quot;For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory&quot; (NRSV). The motto was changed recently to another Proverbs passage: be-'&lt;U+00E9&gt;yn tachb&lt;U+016B&gt;l&lt;U+014D&gt;t yippol `&lt;U+0101&gt;m; &lt;U+016B&gt;-tesh&lt;U+016B&gt;`&lt;U+0101&gt;h be-rov y&lt;U+014D&gt;'&lt;U+00E9&gt;ts (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;, &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt;) (Proverbs 11:14). This is translated by NRSV as: &quot;Where there is no guidance, a nation falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="relations-with-other-agencies">Relations with other agencies</h2>
<p>Over the last 60 years, the Mossad has experienced a mixed relationship with Western intelligence agencies. A secret addendum was promised to <a href="Anwar_Sadat" title="wikilink">Anwar Sadat</a> by the CIA if he agreed to the terms of the <a href="Camp_David_Accords" title="wikilink">Camp David Accords</a>. The <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">CIA</a> would supply Sadat with all of Israel's military secrets, as part of a covert intelligence liaison between Washington and Cairo. According to a former US army officer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We gave Sadat everything. Satellite photos, intercepts, the location of Israel's nuclear force, everything he wanted. As it turned out, the Israelis discovered that we had bribed Sadat, but <a href="Menachem_Begin" title="wikilink">Begin</a> told everyone to keep their mouths shut. America was the only ally Israel had left. Still, betraying all of Israel's secrets was a pretty shitty thing for us to do.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting in 1979, the CIA started sharing intelligence provided by the Mossad with <a href="Saudi_Arabia" title="wikilink">Saudi Arabia</a>. The CIA was &quot;pouring intelligence about Israel into the Saudi's military headquarters.&quot; The Saudis lacked the skills to interpret and analyze most of the Israeli intelligence, so the CIA would provide the expertise, and in exchange the Saudis would share US supplied-information about Israel's weak points with other Arab nations.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

Prior to the ban, the Mossad uncovered <a href="Charles_De_Gaulle" title="wikilink">Charles De Gaulle</a>'s scandalous role in recruiting Fascist fugitives as French agents to fight the Communists in the Balkans. The Mossad revealed that several prominent members of de Gaulle's administration had been <a href="Nazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> collaborators, among them <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Poncet" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Poncet</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The Israelis threatened to expose de Gaulle if he were to implement the weapons ban. No matter how furious French leaders became at Israel, their military intelligence continued to supervise the construction of the plutonium factory at <a href="Dimona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dimona</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>During the Eisenhower administration, CIA director <a href="Allen_Welsh_Dulles" title="wikilink">Allen Welsh Dulles</a> was responsible for recruiting <a href="Nazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> war criminals as intelligence agents and sponsored their immigration to the United States. <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="John_Foster_Dulles" title="wikilink">John Foster Dulles</a> and Allen Welsh Dulles actively betrayed British, French and Israeli military secrets to the Arab nations in order to gain the dominant role in the Middle East.

A team of five Mossad agents slipped into Argentina and through <a href="surveillance" class="uri" title="wikilink">surveillance</a>, they confirmed that he had been living there under the name of Ricardo Klement. He was abducted on May 11, 1960 and taken to a hideout, where the agents put an SS cap on him and compared him to a photograph of Eichmann in SS uniform, confirming that it was Eichmann. He was subsequently smuggled to Israel aboard an <a href="El_Al" title="wikilink">El Al</a> flight where he was tried and executed.

<p>Mossad assisted the UK Intelligence organization <a href="MI5" class="uri" title="wikilink">MI5</a> following the <a href="7/7" class="uri" title="wikilink">7/7</a> bombings in London. According to the 2007 edition of a book about the Mossad entitled &lt;U+201C&gt;Gideon&lt;U+2019&gt;s Spies,&lt;U+201D&gt; shortly after the 7/7 London underground bombings, the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 gathered evidence that a senior al-Qaeda operative known only by the alias Mustafa travelled in and out of England shortly before the 7/7 bombings. For months, the real identity of Mustafa remained unknown, but in early October 2005, Mossad told MI5 that this person was, in fact, Azhari Husin, a bomb-making expert with Jemaah Islamiyah, the main al-Qaeda affiliate in Southeast Asia. Husin studied in Britain and reports claim that he met the main 7/7 bomber, Mohammad Sidique Khan, in late 2001 in a militant training camp in the Philippines (see Late 2001). Meir Dagan, the head of Mossad, apparently also told MI5 that Husin helped plan and recruit volunteers for the bombings. Mossad claimed that Husin may have been in London at the time of the bombings, and then fled to al-Qaeda&lt;U+2019&gt;s main safe haven in the tribal area of Pakistan, where he sometimes hid after bombings. Husin was killed in a shootout in Indonesia in November 2005.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Later official British government reports about the 7/7 bombings did not mention Husin. <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

(ch.4) Philadelphia: U.Penn. Press. In Eichmann's case, the most salient feature from the perspective of international law was the fact of Israeli law enforcement action in another state's territory without consent; the human element includes the dramatic circumstances of the capture by Mossad agents and the ensuing custody and transfer to Israel[.] Damrosch, Lori F. (2004.) Connecting the Threads in the Fabric of International Law. In Stephen Macedo (ed,) <em>Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes</em>. (ch.5) Philadelphia: U.Penn. Press. The principle of territorial integrity (in Art. 2(4) UN Charter) At its most obvious level this means that the exercise of enforcement jurisdiction within the territory of another state will be a violation of territorial integrity <sup>32</sup> Note 32: E.g. after Adolf Eichmann [...] was abducted from Argentina by a group of Israelis, now known to be from the Israeli Secret Service (Mossad), the Argentine Government lodged a complaint with the UN Security Council [...] It is however unclear whether as a matter of international law the obligation to make reparation for a violation of territorial sovereignty such as that involved in the Eichmann case includes an obligation to return the offender. <a href="Rosalyn_Higgins" title="wikilink">Higgins, Rosalyn</a> and Maurice Floy.
