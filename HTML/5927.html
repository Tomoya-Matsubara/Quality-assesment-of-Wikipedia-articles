<p><strong>Early Netherlandish painting</strong> refers to the work of artists, sometimes known as the <strong>Flemish Primitives</strong>, active in the <a href="Burgundian_Netherlands" title="wikilink">Burgundian Netherlands</a> during the 15th- and 16th-century <a href="Northern_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Northern Renaissance</a>, especially in the flourishing cities of <a href="Tournai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tournai</a>, <a href="Bruges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bruges</a>, <a href="Ghent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghent</a> and <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a> in modern-day <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>. Their work follows the <a href="International_Gothic" title="wikilink">International Gothic</a> style and begins approximately with <a href="Robert_Campin" title="wikilink">Robert Campin</a> and <a href="Jan_van_Eyck" title="wikilink">Jan van Eyck</a> in the early 1420s. It lasts at least until the death of <a href="Gerard_David" title="wikilink">Gerard David</a> in 1523,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> although many scholars extend it to the start of the <a href="Dutch_Revolt" title="wikilink">Dutch Revolt</a> in 1566 or 1568. Early Netherlandish painting overlaps in time with the early and <a href="High_Renaissance" title="wikilink">High</a> <a href="Italian_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Italian Renaissance</a> but is seen as an independent artistic culture, separate from the <a href="Renaissance_humanism" title="wikilink">Renaissance humanism</a> that characterised developments in Italy. Because the works of these painters represent the culmination of the northern European <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> artistic heritage and the incorporation of <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> ideals, the painters are sometimes categorised as belonging to both the <a href="Renaissance_art" title="wikilink">Early Renaissance</a> and Late Gothic.</p>
<p>The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, <a href="Rogier_van_der_Weyden" title="wikilink">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, <a href="Dieric_Bouts" title="wikilink">Dieric Bouts</a>, <a href="Petrus_Christus" title="wikilink">Petrus Christus</a>, <a href="Hans_Memling" title="wikilink">Hans Memling</a>, <a href="Hugo_van_der_Goes" title="wikilink">Hugo van der Goes</a> and <a href="Hieronymus_Bosch" title="wikilink">Hieronymus Bosch</a>. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and <a href="illusionism_(art)" title="wikilink">illusionism</a>, and their work often features complex <a href="iconography" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconography</a>. Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The works consist mostly of panel paintings, either as single panels or more complex <a href="altarpiece" title="wikilink">altarpieces</a>, usually in the form of hinged <a href="triptych" title="wikilink">triptychs</a>, <a href="diptych" title="wikilink">diptychs</a> or <a href="polyptych" title="wikilink">polyptychs</a>. The period is also noted for its sculpture, <a href="tapestry" title="wikilink">tapestries</a>, <a href="illuminated_manuscripts" title="wikilink">illuminated manuscripts</a>, <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a>, and carved <a href="retable" title="wikilink">retables</a>.</p>
<p>The period occurred during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre in Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. In conjunction with production by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold on commissions from foreign princes or to merchants through market stalls. The majority of the works were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries and today only a few thousand examples survive. Northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century with the reinvigoration of interest in Early Netherlandish art. <a href="Art_historian" title="wikilink">Art historians</a> spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still hotly debated.</p>
<h2 id="terminology-and-scope">Terminology and scope</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Early Netherlandish art&quot; applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the northern European areas controlled by the <a href="Burgundian_Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dukes of Burgundy</a> and later the <a href="Seventeen_Provinces" title="wikilink">Habsburg dynasty</a>. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of both modern France, Germany, Belgium and Holland.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon" width="240" /> The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. &quot;Late Gothic&quot; is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the <a href="medieval_art" title="wikilink">art of the Middle Ages</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the early 1900s the artists were variously referred to in English as the &quot;Bruges school&quot; or the &quot;Old Netherlandish school&quot;. &quot;Flemish Primitives&quot; is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that became popular after 1902<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In this context, &quot;primitive&quot; does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. <a href="Erwin_Panofsky" title="wikilink">Erwin Panofsky</a> preferred the term <em><a href="ars_nova" title="wikilink">ars nova</a></em> (&quot;new art&quot;), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as <a href="Guillaume_Dufay" title="wikilink">Guillaume Dufay</a> and <a href="Gilles_Binchois" title="wikilink">Gilles Binchois</a>, who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> When the <a href="House_of_Valois-Burgundy" title="wikilink">Burgundian dukes</a> established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook.<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht11&quot;/&gt; According to <a href="Otto_P&lt;U+00E4&gt;cht" title="wikilink">Otto P&lt;U+00E4&gt;cht</a> a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a &quot;revolution took place in painting&quot;; a &quot;new beauty&quot; in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world. This new approach become popular throughout Europe.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with <a href="Jan_van_Eyck" title="wikilink">Jan van Eyck</a> identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school's genesis was in France or Germany.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Those arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of <a href="Max_Jakob_Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder" title="wikilink">Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder</a>, Panofsky, and P&lt;U+00E4&gt;cht, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as &quot;Early Netherlandish painting&quot;, although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 14th century as <a href="Gothic_art" title="wikilink">Gothic art</a> gave way to the <a href="International_Gothic" title="wikilink">International Gothic</a> era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of <a href="illuminated_manuscript" title="wikilink">illuminated manuscripts</a>. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as <a href="Melchior_Broederlam" title="wikilink">Melchior Broederlam</a> and <a href="Robert_Campin" title="wikilink">Robert Campin</a>, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and <a href="House_of_Valois-Anjou" title="wikilink">House of Valois-Anjou</a> dukes such as <a href="Philip_the_Bold" title="wikilink">Philip the Bold</a>, <a href="Louis_I,_Duke_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Louis I of Anjou</a> and <a href="Jean,_Duke_of_Berry" title="wikilink">Jean, Duke of Berry</a>.

<p>Following van Eyck's innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Johan_Huizinga" title="wikilink">Johan Huizinga</a> said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to &quot;fill with beauty&quot; the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble <em><a href="Madonna_of_Bruges" title="wikilink">Madonna and Child</a></em> by <a href="Michelangelo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michelangelo</a> to Bruges in 1506,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and the arrival of <a href="Raphael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Raphael</a>'s <a href="Raphael_Cartoons" title="wikilink">tapestry cartoons</a> to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo's <em>Madonna</em> based on a type developed by <a href="Hans_Memling" title="wikilink">Hans Memling</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of <a href="Gerard_David" title="wikilink">Gerard David</a> in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists, including <a href="Quentin_Matsys" title="wikilink">Quentin Matsys</a> and Hieronymus Bosch, maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In the early 1500s artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The painting of the early-16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of <a href="Renaissance_humanism" title="wikilink">Renaissance humanism</a>, turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of <a href="Northern_Mannerism" title="wikilink">Northern Mannerism</a> around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> peaking with the <a href="Limbourg_brothers" title="wikilink">Limbourg brothers</a> and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leafs of the <a href="Turin-Milan_Hours" title="wikilink">Turin-Milan Hours</a> are usually attributed.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother <a href="Hubert_van_Eyck" title="wikilink">Hubert</a>. According to <a href="Georges_Hulin_de_Loo" title="wikilink">Georges Hulin de Loo</a>, Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours &quot;constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Jan van Eyck's use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th century art historian <a href="Giorgio_Vasari" title="wikilink">Giorgio Vasari</a> claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated,<ref name="P<U+00E4>cht11&quot;/&gt; indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck utilised a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly, it allowed him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by Robert Campin and <a href="Rogier_van_der_Weyden" title="wikilink">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a> and Poland in the east to Austria and <a href="Swabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swabia</a> in the south.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Rogier de la Pasture in <a href="Tournai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tournai</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The German Hans Memling and the Estonian <a href="Michael_Sittow" title="wikilink">Michael Sittow</a> both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. <a href="Simon_Marmion" title="wikilink">Simon Marmion</a> is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from <a href="Amiens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amiens</a>, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to in the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as <a href="Matthias_Corvinus" title="wikilink">Matthias Corvinus</a>, <a href="King_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">King of Hungary</a>, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a <a href="valet_de_chambre" title="wikilink">valet de chambre</a> at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine &quot;Mettengelde&quot; (&quot;with the money&quot;).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Vrancke_van_der_Stockt" title="wikilink">Vrancke van der Stockt</a> invested in land.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as <a href="Stefan_Lochner" title="wikilink">Stefan Lochner</a> and the painter known as the <a href="Master_of_the_Life_of_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">Master of the Life of the Virgin</a>, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a>, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; <a href="Ulm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulm</a>, <a href="Nuremberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> and <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> were the most important artistic centres in the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Empire</a> at the start of the 16th century.

Even progressive artists such as <a href="Jan_Gossaert" title="wikilink">Jan Gossaert</a> made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's <em><a href="Madonna_in_the_Church" title="wikilink">Madonna in the Church</a></em>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Gerard David linked the styles of <a href="Bruges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bruges</a> and <a href="Antwerp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antwerp</a>, often travelling between the cities.

<p>By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht D&lt;U+00FC&gt;rer emulated van Eyck's precision.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. <a href="Hieronymus_Bosch" title="wikilink">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences.

<p>The <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Reformation</a> brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>, one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern.

<h2 id="technique-and-material">Technique and material</h2>
<p>Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established <a href="Realism_(arts)" title="wikilink">naturalism</a> as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted &quot;gold that looked like gold&quot;),<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="wikilink">reflection</a>. They moved beyond the flat <a href="Perspective_(visual)" title="wikilink">perspective</a> and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the <em><a href="Arnolfini_Portrait" title="wikilink">Arnolfini Portrait</a></em>, Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and enable <a href="wet-on-wet" class="uri" title="wikilink">wet-on-wet</a> techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The paintings were most often painted on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas. The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Wood supports allow for <a href="Dendrochronology" title="wikilink">dendrochronological</a> dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. <a href="Lorne_Campbell_(art_historian)" title="wikilink">Lorne Campbell</a> notes that most are &quot;beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, &quot;done for the artist's amusement&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Glue-size" title="wikilink">Glue</a> binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Well known and relatively well preserved &lt;U+2013&gt; though substantially damaged &lt;U+2013&gt; examples include Matsys' <em><a href="Virgin_and_Child_with_Saints_Barbara_and_Catherine" title="wikilink">Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine</a></em> (c. 1415&lt;U+2013&gt;25)<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and Bouts' <em><a href="The_Entombment_(Bouts)" title="wikilink">Entombment</a></em> (c. 1440&lt;U+2013&gt;55).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles.

<h2 id="guilds-and-workshops">Guilds and workshops</h2>
<p>The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan <a href="guild" title="wikilink">guilds</a> to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting; overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply and maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a &quot;<a href="masterpiece" class="uri" title="wikilink">masterpiece</a>&quot; that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's <em><a href="The_Descent_from_the_Cross_(van_der_Weyden)" title="wikilink">Descent from the Cross</a></em>, in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a <a href="crossbow" class="uri" title="wikilink">crossbow</a> to reflect its commission for a chapel for the <a href="Leuven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leuven</a> guild of archers.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The masters typically built up inventories of prepainted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak <a href="Deesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deesis</a> passage in van Eyck's <em>Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych</em> being a better-known example.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Typically a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In this case, the master would usually produce the <a href="underdrawing" class="uri" title="wikilink">underdrawing</a> or overall composition to be painted by assistants. As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>By the 1400s the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic</a> coast, the north German and Polish regions, the <a href="Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberian Peninsula</a>, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The mid-century saw the development of <a href="art_dealer" title="wikilink">art dealership</a> as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Prototypes were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display on their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class &lt;U+2013&gt; city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.<ref name="Campbell 1976 188<U+2013>189&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Less expensive cloth paintings (<em><a href="Glue-size" title="wikilink">t&lt;U+00FC&gt;chlein</a></em>) were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings.<ref name="Campbell 1976 188<U+2013>189&quot;/&gt; Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specifically desired themes. Changes might vary from something such as having an individualized panel added to the prefabricated pattern, or more simply having an individualized image of the donor depicted as one of the saints. The addition of coats-of-arms were frequently the smallest and only changes &lt;U+2013&gt; an addition seen in van der Weyden's <em><a href="Saint_Luke_Drawing_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin</a></em>, which has an original and several variations.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the &quot;excellent work that he does in his craft&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Jan van Eyck painted the <em><a href="Annunciation_(van_Eyck,_Washington)" title="wikilink">Annunciation</a></em> while in Philip's employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke's portrait painter in the 1440s.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries.

<p>The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus.

<p>Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps &quot;the most important aspect of early Flemish art&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and &quot;was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular &quot;always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality&quot;.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, &quot;descriptive data were rearranged ... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the &quot;essential truth of Christian doctrine&quot; can be found in &quot;the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the <em><a href="Lucca_Madonna" title="wikilink">Lucca Madonna</a></em>). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as <em>Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</em>, where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing,<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a &quot;promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth&quot;.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that &quot;Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed.&quot;<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> His treatment of architectural details, <a href="Niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niches</a>, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that &quot;the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth.&quot;<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>

<p>Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on <a href="Byzantine_art" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the <em><a href="Cambrai_Madonna" title="wikilink">Cambrai Madonna</a></em> is probably the best known.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the <a href="Immaculate_Conception" title="wikilink">Immaculate Conception</a> and her <a href="Assumption_of_Mary" title="wikilink">Assumption into heaven</a>. In a culture that venerated the possession of <a href="relic" title="wikilink">relics</a> as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> By the early 1400s, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in <a href="limbo" class="uri" title="wikilink">limbo</a> was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid 15th century Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the <a href="Man_of_Sorrows" title="wikilink">Man of Sorrows</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>Those who could afford to commissioned <a href="donor_portrait" title="wikilink">donor portraits</a>. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length <a href="Madonna_(art)" title="wikilink">Marian portraits</a>. These echoed the &quot;miracle-working&quot; Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> </p>

Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's <a href="commons:File:Rogier_van_der_Weyden_-_Portrait_of_Charles_the_Bold_-_WGA25709.jpg" title="wikilink">portrait</a> of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck's lost <em><a href="Portrait_of_Isabella_of_Portugal_(van_Eyck)" title="wikilink">Portrait of Isabella of Portugal</a></em>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings.<ref name="Campbell 1976 188<U+2013>189&quot;/&gt; Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts.

At the start of the 15th century Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to &quot;include as many pictures as they could afford&quot;, which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of <a href="indulgence" class="uri" title="wikilink">indulgence</a>. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> as seen in Christus' 1450&lt;U+2013&gt;60 panel <em>Portrait of a Young Man</em>, now in the <a href="National_Gallery" title="wikilink">National Gallery</a>, which shows a small leaf with text to the <em><a href="Veil_of_Veronica" title="wikilink">Vera icon</a></em> illustrated with the head of Christ.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and <a href="Utrecht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utrecht</a>. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in the number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of <a href="Liturgical_book" title="wikilink">liturgical texts</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> According to Thomas Kren, Philip's &quot;library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state &lt;U+2013&gt; his politics and authority, his learning and piety&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and <a href="Margaret_of_York" title="wikilink">Margaret of York</a>; his granddaughter <a href="Mary_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Mary of Burgundy</a> and her husband <a href="Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Maximilian I</a>; and to his son-in-law, <a href="Edward_IV_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward IV</a>. Edward was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the <a href="Royal_Library_of_Belgium" title="wikilink">Royal Library of Belgium</a> and the <a href="Royal_manuscripts,_British_Library" title="wikilink">English Royal Library</a>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, <a href="James_IV_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James IV of Scotland</a> and <a href="Eleanor_of_Viseu" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Viseu</a>.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the &quot;Hours of Raoul d'Ailly&quot;.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> An example is the <a href="Hours_of_Mary_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Nassau book of hours</a> (c. 1467&lt;U+2013&gt;80) by the <a href="Vienna_Master_of_Mary_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy</a>, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish <a href="Master_of_James_IV_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Master of James IV of Scotland</a> (possibly <a href="Gerard_Horenbout" title="wikilink">Gerard Horenbout</a>),<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>During the early-19th-century collecting cut-out 15th and 16th century Netherlandish miniatures or parts of them in albums became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as <a href="William_Young_Ottley" title="wikilink">William Young Ottley</a>, leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> </p>

<p>During the mid-15th century <a href="tapestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">tapestry</a> was one of the most expensive and prized artistic product in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 1400s, especially in the cities of <a href="Arras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arras</a>, Bruges and <a href="Tournai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tournai</a>. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, <a href="Pope_Julius_II" title="wikilink">Pope Julius II</a> sent <a href="Raphael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Raphael</a>'s <a href="Raphael_Cartoons" title="wikilink">cartoons</a> to Brussels to be woven into hangings.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> These woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the <a href="Congress_of_Arras" title="wikilink">Congress of Arras</a> in 1435,<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (<em>tout autour</em>) with tapestries showing scenes of the &quot;Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room &quot;was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece&quot;. Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from <em><a href="Roman_de_la_Rose" title="wikilink">The Romance of the Rose</a></em>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> For about two centuries, during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced &quot;innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen.&quot;<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. <a href="Charles_V_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles V of France</a> had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. <a href="John,_Duke_of_Berry" title="wikilink">Jean de Berry</a> owned 19, while <a href="Mary_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Mary of Burgundy</a>, <a href="Isabella_of_Valois" title="wikilink">Isabella of Valois</a>, <a href="Isabeau_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Isabeau of Bavaria</a> and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Tapestry production began with design.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> The designs, or <a href="Cartoon#Fine_art" title="wikilink">cartoons</a> (<em>klein patroons</em> in Flemish, <em>petit patrons</em> in French), were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Tapestry_with_Scenes_from_the_Passion_of_Christ.jpg" title="fig:Unknown Flemish weaver, Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ, c. 1470&lt;U+2013&gt;90. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam" alt="Unknown Flemish weaver, Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ, c. 1470&lt;U+2013&gt;90. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam" width="260" /> Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver &lt;U+2013&gt; which often had to be imported.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by <a href="Colart_de_Laon" title="wikilink">Colart de Laon</a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's &lt;U+2013&gt; and presumably his commissioner's &lt;U+2013&gt; considerable embarrassment.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch's <em><a href="Garden_of_Earthly_Delights" title="wikilink">Garden of Earthly Delights</a></em> resembles, &quot;in its precise symbolism ... a medieval tapestry&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="triptychs-and-altarpieces">Triptychs and altarpieces</h3>
<p>Northern <a href="triptych" title="wikilink">triptychs</a> and <a href="polyptych" title="wikilink">polyptychs</a> were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 1500s. During the 1400s they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for <a href="liturgy" title="wikilink">liturgical</a> settings.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="The_Braque_Triptych_interior.jpg" title="fig:Rogier van der Weyden, Braque Triptych, c. 1452. Oil on oak panels. Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e du Louvre, Paris.

Oil on oak panels. Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e du Louvre, Paris. This triptych is noted for the floating inscriptions and speech balloon stretching from panel to panel, and for the landscape uniting the panels." width="560" /> Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The <em><a href="Ghent_Altarpiece" title="wikilink">Ghent Altarpiece</a></em>, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<p>The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the <a href="Holy_Family" title="wikilink">Holy Family</a>, or in early works, especially from the <a href="Siena" title="wikilink">Sienese</a> or Florentine traditions, was overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442&lt;U+2013&gt;45 <em><a href="Miraflores_Altarpiece" title="wikilink">Miraflores Altarpiece</a></em> and c. 1452 <em><a href="Braque_Triptych" title="wikilink">Braque Triptych</a></em>. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>

<p>Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Few of these very early examples survive,<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. <a href="Till-Holger_Borchert" title="wikilink">Till-Holger Borchert</a> describes how they bestowed a &quot;prestige which, in the first half of the fifteenth century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving.&quot;<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of <a href="division_of_labour" title="wikilink">division of labour</a>.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-1500s. Later the <a href="iconoclasm" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconoclasm</a> of the Reformation deemed them offensive,<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that &quot;it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings.&quot;<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="diptychs">Diptychs</h3>
<p><a href="Diptych" title="wikilink">Diptychs</a> were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame);<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Originating from conventions in <a href="Book_of_Hours" title="wikilink">Books of Hours</a>, diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval &quot;treasury art&quot; -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The <a href="tracery" class="uri" title="wikilink">tracery</a> seen in works such as van der Weyden's <em><a href="Virgin_and_Child_Enthroned_(van_der_Weyden)" title="wikilink">Virgin and Child</a></em> reflects ivory carving of the period.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the <a href="House_of_Valois-Burgundy" title="wikilink">House of Valois-Burgundy</a>,<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> and refined by <a href="Hugo_van_der_Goes" title="wikilink">Hugo van der Goes</a>, Hans Memling and later <a href="Jan_van_Scorel" title="wikilink">Jan van Scorel</a>.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>

There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child,<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits &lt;U+2013&gt; often of husbands and their wives<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; alongside saints or the Virgin and Child.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the &quot;place of honour&quot; alongside the divine.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p>Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion &lt;U+2013&gt; exemplified by the <a href="Devotio_Moderna" title="wikilink">Devotio Moderna</a> movement &lt;U+2013&gt; grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a &quot;matter of small scale and meticulous detail&quot;. The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the &quot;experience of miraculous visions.&quot;<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels may be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on a general design offered on the open market, while the donor panel was added after a patron was found.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single &quot;genre&quot; pictures.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> </p>

<p>Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> his seminal 1432 <em><a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;al_Souvenir" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;al Souvenir</a></em> is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> His <em><a href="Arnolfini_Portrait" title="wikilink">Arnolfini Portrait</a></em> is filled with symbolism,<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> as is the <em>Madonna of Chancelor Rolin</em>, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<p>Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>

<p>Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> In his 1462 <em><a href=":commons:File:Bouts_Portrait_of_a_Man_1462.jpg" title="wikilink">Portrait of a Man</a></em>, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape,<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> while in the 1500s, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in <a href="fresco" class="uri" title="wikilink">fresco</a> and illuminated manuscripts.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring <a href="Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="wikilink">Leonardo</a>'s positioning of the <a href="Mona_Lisa" title="wikilink">Mona Lisa</a> in front of a landscape view.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist <a href="Jean_Fouquet" title="wikilink">Jean Fouquet</a> and the Germans <a href="Hans_Pleydenwurff" title="wikilink">Hans Pleydenwurff</a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> and Martin Schongauer among others.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view &lt;U+2013&gt; popularised during the Italian <a href="Quattrocento" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quattrocento</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> Van Eyck's 1433 <em><a href="Portrait_of_a_Man_(Self_Portrait?)" title="wikilink">Portrait of a Man</a></em> is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential <a href="betrothal" title="wikilink">betrothals</a>, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
<p>Around 1508, Albrecht D&lt;U+00FC&gt;rer described the function of portraiture as &quot;preserving a person's appearance after his death&quot;.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> During the 15th century, portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being <a href=":commons:File:Jan_van_Eyck_-_Portrait_of_Cardinal_Niccol&lt;U+00F2&gt;_Albergati_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" title="wikilink">van Eyck's study</a> for his <em><a href="Portrait_of_Cardinal_Niccol&lt;U+00F2&gt;_Albergati" title="wikilink">Portrait of Cardinal Niccol&lt;U+00F2&gt; Albergati</a></em>.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>

Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or <a href="Arcade_(architecture)" title="wikilink">arcades</a>. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c. 1430 <em>Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych</em> and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435&lt;U+2013&gt;40 <em>Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin</em>.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the <a href="Labours_of_the_Months" title="wikilink">Labours of the Months</a> landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the <em>Tr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</em>. The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the Turin-Milan Hours, which show rich landscapes in the tiny <em>bas de page</em> scenes.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> These, according to P&lt;U+00E4&gt;cht, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. <a href="Simon_Bening" title="wikilink">Simon Bening</a> &quot;explored new territory in the genre of landscape&quot;, seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 <em><a href="Grimani" title="wikilink">Grimani Breviary</a></em>.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
<p>From the late 15th century a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably <a href="Konrad_Witz" title="wikilink">Konrad Witz</a> in the mid-1400s, and later <a href="Joachim_Patinir" title="wikilink">Joachim Patinir</a>.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from <a href="Haarlem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haarlem</a>, <a href="Leiden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leiden</a> and <a href="&#39;s-Hertogenbosch" class="uri" title="wikilink">'s-Hertogenbosch</a>. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>
<p>Patinir developed what is now called the <a href="world_landscape" title="wikilink">world landscape</a> genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the <a href="Danube_school" title="wikilink">Danube school</a>. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called &quot;landscape&quot; format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a <a href="long_shot" title="wikilink">long</a> rather than a <a href="medium_shot" title="wikilink">medium shot</a>. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere <a href="staffage" class="uri" title="wikilink">staffage</a>. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>The most popular subjects of this type include the <a href="Flight_into_Egypt" title="wikilink">Flight into Egypt</a> and the plight of hermits such as Saints <a href="Jerome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerome</a> and <a href="Anthony_the_Great" title="wikilink">Anthony</a>.

This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, &quot;picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours &lt;U+2013&gt; actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism&quot;.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a></p>

Uffizi, Florence" width="200" /> The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> However Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;that elegant harmony and grace ... which is called beauty&quot;, evident, for example, in <a href="Andrea_Mantegna" title="wikilink">Andrea Mantegna</a>'s <em><a href=":File:Andrea_Mantegna_-_The_Dead_Christ.jpg" title="wikilink">Entombment</a></em>.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> By the early 16th century the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north-south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Hugo van der Goes' <em><a href="Portinari_Altarpiece" title="wikilink">Portinari Altarpiece</a></em>, in Florence's <a href="Uffizi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uffizi</a>, played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like <a href="Giovanni_Bellini" title="wikilink">Giovanni Bellini</a> came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<p>Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his <em>Virgin and Child with Two Angels</em>. By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; <a href="Michaelangelo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michaelangelo</a> claimed it was appealing only to &quot;monks and friars&quot;.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy.

From 1520, outbursts of reformist <a href="iconoclasm" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconoclasm</a> broke out across much of Northern Europe.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tudors</a> and the <a href="English_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">English Commonwealth</a>, or unofficial and often violent, as in the <em><a href="Beeldenstorm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beeldenstorm</a></em> or &quot;Iconoclastic Fury&quot; in 1566 in the Netherlands. On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where <a href="Marcus_van_Vaernewijck" title="wikilink">Marcus van Vaernewijck</a> (1518&lt;U+2013&gt;69) chronicled the events. He wrote of the <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em> being &quot;taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters&quot;.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566,<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> followed by more losses in the Spanish <a href="Sack_of_Antwerp" title="wikilink">Sack of Antwerp</a> in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>
<p>Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes,<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low &lt;U+2013&gt; even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of the period's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches,<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's <em>Madonna in the Church</em> and van der Weyden's <em><a href="commons:File:Rogier_van_der_Weyden_and_workshop_-_Exhumation_of_St_Hubert_NG_783.jpg" title="wikilink">Exhumation of St Hubert</a></em>. Van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches according to Nash, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, &quot;any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes&quot;. Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's <em><a href="The_Justice_of_Trajan_and_Herkinbald" title="wikilink">The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald</a></em> polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em>.

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Some painters, such as <a href="Adriaen_Isenbrandt" title="wikilink">Adriaen Isenbrandt</a> and <a href="Ambrosius_Benson" title="wikilink">Ambrosius Benson</a> of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
<p>The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s,<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>
<p>Because Jan van Eyck's life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period's innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Works attributed to Jan have since shrunk to around 26&lt;U+2013&gt;28, following in part from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling,<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by &quot;names of convenience&quot;. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the &quot;notname&quot; term is often used, a derivative of a German term. Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Fl&lt;U+00E9&gt;malle.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a></p>
<p>Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, &quot;much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied&quot;.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called <a href="Master_of_the_Legend_of_the_Magdalen" title="wikilink">Master of the Legend of the Magdalen</a>, who may have been <a href="Pieter_van_Coninxloo" title="wikilink">Pieter van Coninxloo</a>, is one of the more notable examples;<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
<p>The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. D&lt;U+00FC&gt;rer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by <a href="Lucas_de_Heere" title="wikilink">Lucas de Heere</a> in 1565 and <a href="Karel_van_Mander" title="wikilink">Karel van Mander</a> in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include <a href="Ciriaco_de&#39;_Pizzicolli" title="wikilink">Cyriacus Ancona</a> in 1449, <a href="Bartolommeo_Fazio" title="wikilink">Bartolommeo Fazio</a> in 1456, and <a href="Giovanni_Santi" title="wikilink">Giovanni Santi</a> in 1482.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rediscovery">Rediscovery</h2>
<p>The dominance of Northern <a href="Mannerism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mannerism</a> in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; <a href="Mary_of_Hungary_(governor_of_the_Netherlands)" title="wikilink">Mary of Hungary</a> and <a href="Philip_II_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Philip II of Spain</a> both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht D&lt;U+00FC&gt;rer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. <a href="Giorgio_Vasari" title="wikilink">Giorgio Vasari</a> in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c. 1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
<p>The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When <a href="The_Louvre" title="wikilink">Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e du Louvre</a> was converted to an art gallery during the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, Gerard David's <em>Marriage at Cana</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; then attributed to van Eyck &lt;U+2013&gt; was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French <a href="Campaigns_of_1794_in_the_French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="wikilink">conquered the Low Countries</a>. These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher <a href="Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel" title="wikilink">Karl Schlegel</a>, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to <a href="Ludwig_Tieck" title="wikilink">Ludwig Tieck</a>, who had the piece published in 1805.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1821 <a href="Johanna_Schopenhauer" title="wikilink">Johanna Schopenhauer</a> became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers <a href="Sulpiz_Boisser&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" title="wikilink">Sulpiz</a> and <a href="Melchior_Boisser&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" title="wikilink">Melchior Boisser&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> in Heidelberg.

Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1830 the <a href="Belgian_Revolution" title="wikilink">Belgian Revolution</a> split Belgium from the Netherlands of today and created new national divisions among the cities of <a href="Bruges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bruges</a> (home of van Eyck and Memling), <a href="Antwerp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antwerp</a> (Matsys), Brussels (van der Weyden and Bruegel) and Leuven (Bouts). As the newly created state of Belgium sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling's reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master's match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of <a href="House_of_Oettingen-Wallerstein" title="wikilink">Oettingen-Wallerstein</a> at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin <a href="Albert,_Prince_Consort" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a> arranged a viewing at <a href="Kensington_Palace" title="wikilink">Kensington Palace</a>; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a><a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> At a period when London's <a href="National_Gallery" title="wikilink">National Gallery</a> sought to increase its prestige,<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Lock_Eastlake" title="wikilink">Charles Eastlake</a> purchased Rogier van der Weyden's <em><a href="The_Magdalen_Reading" title="wikilink">The Magdalen Reading</a></em> panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin's &quot;small but choice&quot; collection of early Netherlandish paintings.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a></p>
<p>Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 1800s. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first exhibition of Netherlandish art with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a &quot;turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art&quot;.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling's pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a></p>
<p>The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period &lt;U+2013&gt; outside of nationalistic borders &lt;U+2013&gt; suggesting in his book <em><a href="The_Waning_of_the_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">The Waning of the Middle Ages</a></em> that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a> Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners.

<p>The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian <a href="Max_Jakob_Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder" title="wikilink">Max Jakob Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder</a>'s pioneering <em>Meisterwerke der Niederl&lt;U+00E4&gt;ndischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts</em>. Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder focused on providing biographical detail about the painters, establishing attribution, and closely examining the major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German <a href="Erwin_Panofsky" title="wikilink">Erwin Panofsky</a>'s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedl&lt;U+00E4&gt;nder's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early <a href="Italian_Renaissance_painting" title="wikilink">Italian renaissance</a>.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a></p>

Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting &lt;U+2013&gt; as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>

<p>More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> The conservation of the <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em> in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. The technical examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> According to <a href="Craig_Harbison" title="wikilink">Craig Harbison</a>, &quot;Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were.&quot;<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a &quot;prayer book mentality&quot; available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
