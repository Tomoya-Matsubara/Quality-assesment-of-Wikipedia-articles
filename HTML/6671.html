<p>The <strong>Fifteenth Amendment</strong> (<strong>Amendment XV</strong>) to the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a> prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the <a href="suffrage" title="wikilink">right to vote</a> based on that citizen's &quot;<a href="Race_(classification_of_humans)" title="wikilink">race</a>, <a href="Colored" title="wikilink">color</a>, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. It was ratified on February 3, 1870, as the third and last of the <a href="Reconstruction_Amendments" title="wikilink">Reconstruction Amendments</a>.</p>
<p>In the final years of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> and the <a href="Reconstruction_Era" title="wikilink">Reconstruction Era</a> that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the narrow election of <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a> to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black voters was important for the party's future. After rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude on February 26, 1869. The amendment survived a difficult ratification fight and was adopted on March 30, 1870.</p>
<p><a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> decisions in the late nineteenth century interpreted the amendment narrowly, and by 1910, most black voters in the South faced obstacles such as <a href="poll_tax" title="wikilink">poll taxes</a> and <a href="literacy_test" title="wikilink">literacy tests</a>, from which white voters were exempted by <a href="grandfather_clause" title="wikilink">grandfather clauses</a>. A system of <a href="white_primaries" title="wikilink">whites-only primaries</a> and violent reprisals by groups such as the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a> also <a href="Voter_suppression" title="wikilink">suppressed</a> black participation.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, the Court interpreted the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in <em><a href="Guinn_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Guinn v. United States</a></em> (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the &quot;Texas primary cases&quot; (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the <a href="Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Twenty-fourth Amendment</a>, which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and <em><a href="Harper_v._Virginia_State_Board_of_Elections" title="wikilink">Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections</a></em> (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in the American political system.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>In the final years of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> and the <a href="Reconstruction_Era" title="wikilink">Reconstruction Era</a> that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and the 1865 <a href="Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Thirteenth Amendment</a>, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republicans</a> grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a>-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous <a href="Three-Fifths_Compromise" title="wikilink">Three-Fifths Compromise</a>, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1865, Congress passed what would become the <a href="Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the <a href="Black_Codes_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Black Codes</a> passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. The Civil Rights Act was vetoed by President <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a>, an uncompromising white supremacist. Congress overrode his veto in April 1866, but the experience encouraged them to seek Constitutional guarantees of black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities. In the same month, Congress proposed the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless of race. After a bitter struggle that included attempted <a href="rescission" title="wikilink">rescissions</a> of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment stopped short of guaranteeing the franchise to black citizens, and included language specifically acknowledging that the states could disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a>.</p>
<p>Though the <a href="Radical_Republicans" title="wikilink">Radical Republicans</a> had advocated legal equality between whites and blacks since before the war's end, the party refused to include the issue in the platform at their <a href="1868_Republican_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1868 National Convention</a>. However, the party's narrow win in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1868" title="wikilink">1868 presidential election</a>, in part due to the support of black voters, convinced many in the party that black suffrage was necessary for future electoral success.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Anticipating an increase in Democratic membership in the following Congress, Republicans used the <a href="lame_duck_session" title="wikilink">lame duck session</a> of the <a href="40th_United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">40th United States Congress</a> to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Representative <a href="John_Bingham" title="wikilink">John Bingham</a>, the primary author of the Fourteenth Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a broader proposal banning voter restriction on the basis of &quot;race, color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs&quot; was rejected. A proposal to specifically ban <a href="literacy_test" title="wikilink">literacy tests</a> was also rejected.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Some representatives from the North, where <a href="Nativism_(politics)" title="wikilink">nativism</a> was a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to foreign-born citizens, as did representatives from the West, where <a href="Chinese_American" title="wikilink">Chinese Americans</a> were banned from voting. Both Southern and Northern Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote to Southerners disenfranchised for support of the <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederacy</a>, and were concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would re-enfranchise this group.</p>
<p>A House and Senate <a href="conference_committee" title="wikilink">conference committee</a> proposed the amendment's final text, which banned voter restriction only on the basis of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In order to attract the broadest possible base of support, the amendment made no mention of poll taxes or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of blacks to hold office. This compromise proposal was approved by the House on February 25, 1869 and the Senate the following day.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The vote in the House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it. The final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting. Some Radicals, such as Massachusetts Senator <a href="Charles_Sumner" title="wikilink">Charles Sumner</a>, abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes.</p>
<h3 id="ratification">Ratification</h3>
<p>Though many of the original proposals for the amendment had been moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, &quot;it was hard going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>One source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">women's suffrage</a> movement, which before and during the Civil War had made common cause with the <a href="abolitionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">abolitionist</a> movement. However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the <a href="American_Equal_Rights_Association" title="wikilink">American Equal Rights Association</a>, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the <a href="National_Woman_Suffrage_Association" title="wikilink">National Woman Suffrage Association</a> of <a href="Susan_B._Anthony" title="wikilink">Susan B. Anthony</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, who opposed the amendment, and the <a href="American_Woman_Suffrage_Association" title="wikilink">American Woman Suffrage Association</a> of <a href="Lucy_Stone" title="wikilink">Lucy Stone</a> and <a href="Henry_Browne_Blackwell" title="wikilink">Henry Browne Blackwell</a>, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified the amendment soon after its proposal.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified. Newly elected President <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a> (a Republican) strongly endorsed the amendment and privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <img src="15th-amendment-celebration-1870.jpg" title="fig:1870 celebration of the Fifteenth Amendment as a guarantee of African American voting rights" alt="1870 celebration of the Fifteenth Amendment as a guarantee of African American voting rights" width="190" /> The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, attempted to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight (three-fourths of the total states), and forestalling any court challenge as a result of New York's <a href="rescission" class="uri" title="wikilink">rescission</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Secretary of State <a href="Hamilton_Fish" title="wikilink">Hamilton Fish</a> certified the amendment on March 30, 1870.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The amendment was subsequently ratified by additional states, beginning with New Jersey on February 15, 1871. Oregon, California, Maryland, Kentucky, and Tennessee all ratified the amendment in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded, feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete. President Grant said of the amendment that it &quot;completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came to life&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president <a href="James_A._Garfield" title="wikilink">James A. Garfield</a> stated that the amendment's passage &quot;confers upon the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands.&quot;</p>

<p>The first known black voter after the amendment's adoption was <a href="Thomas_Mundy_Peterson" title="wikilink">Thomas Mundy Peterson</a>, who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870 in the <a href="Perth_Amboy,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Perth Amboy, New Jersey</a> mayoral election.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

The Court also stated that the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by &quot;appropriate legislation.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Court wrote:</p>

<p><a href="White_supremacist" title="wikilink">White supremacists</a> such as the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) used paramilitary violence to prevent black people from voting.

In <em><a href="United_States_v._Cruikshank" title="wikilink">United States v.

<p>From 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of blacks. <a href="White_primaries" title="wikilink">White-only primary elections</a> also served to reduce the influence of blacks in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of <a href="lynch_mob" title="wikilink">lynch mobs</a> and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In <em><a href="Guinn_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Guinn v.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act required states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the federal government for approval before they could take affect, a process called &quot;preclearance.&quot; The Supreme Court originally upheld these provisions as constitutional in <em><a href="South_Carolina_v._Katzenbach" title="wikilink">South Carolina v.

The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment &quot;commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> According to the Court, &quot;Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the &lt;U+2018&gt;pervasive,&lt;U+2019&gt; &lt;U+2018&gt;flagrant, &lt;U+2018&gt;widespread,&lt;U+2019&gt; and &lt;U+2018&gt;rampant&lt;U+2019&gt; discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation.&quot; The preclearance provision itself was not struck down, but without a valid coverage formula, it no longer has any effect; it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
