<p>The <strong>War in Darfur</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is a major armed-conflict in the <a href="Darfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darfur</a> region of <a href="Sudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudan</a>. It began in February 2003 when the <a href="Sudan_Liberation_Movement/Army" title="wikilink">Sudan Liberation Movement/Army</a> (SLM/A) and <a href="Justice_and_Equality_Movement" title="wikilink">Justice and Equality Movement</a> (JEM) rebel groups took up arms against the <a href="Government_of_Sudan" title="wikilink">Government of Sudan</a> which they accused of marginalizing Darfur's non-<a href="Arab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arab</a> population. The government responded to attacks by arming <a href="Janjaweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janjaweed</a> militias and carrying out a campaign of <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnic cleansing</a> against non-Arabs in Darfur resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president <a href="Omar_al-Bashir" title="wikilink">Omar al-Bashir</a> for <a href="genocide" class="uri" title="wikilink">genocide</a> and <a href="crimes_against_humanity" title="wikilink">crimes against humanity</a> by the <a href="International_Criminal_Court" title="wikilink">International Criminal Court</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>One side of the conflict was composed mainly of the official Sudanese military and police, and the <a href="Janjaweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janjaweed</a>, a Sudanese <a href="militia" class="uri" title="wikilink">militia</a> group recruited mostly from the <a href="Arabization" title="wikilink">Arabized</a> indigenous Africans and few Arab <a href="Bedouin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedouin</a> of the northern <a href="Rizeigat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rizeigat</a>; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remain uninvolved in the conflict.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The other combatants are made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim <a href="Fur_people" title="wikilink">Fur</a>, <a href="Zaghawa_people" title="wikilink">Zaghawa</a>, and <a href="Masalit_people" title="wikilink">Masalit</a> ethnic groups. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supports the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it has provided financial assistance and weapons to the militia as well as coordinated joint attacks,many against civilians, along with the group.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>There are various estimates on <a href="Darfur_Genocide#Mortality_figures" title="wikilink">the number of human casualties</a> which range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease inflicted by the conflict. There have also been mass displacements and coercive migrations, forcing millions into refugee camps or over the border and creating a large <a href="humanitarian_crisis" title="wikilink">humanitarian crisis</a> and is regarded by many, like US Secretary of State Colin Powell, as either a genocide, or acts of genocide.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue further peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, talks have been disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the February agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, has said they will boycott further negotiations.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The conflict's origin goes back to land disputes between semi-nomadic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the population of Darfur is predominantly Muslim, the conflict may not be only about race or religion, but about resources as the nomadic tribes facing drought are going after the territory of sedentary farmers.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Boston Globe columnist Fred Jacoby has accused Sudan of practicing apartheid against Christians in what is now South Sudan &quot;where tens of thousands of black Africans in the country's southern region, most of them Christians or animists, have been abducted and sold into slavery by Arab militias backed by the Islamist regime in Khartoum.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Alan_Dershowitz" title="wikilink">Alan Dershowitz</a> has pointed to Sudan as an example of a government that &quot;actually deserve(s)&quot; the appellation &quot;apartheid.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Other distinguished people who have accused the regime in Sudan of practising &quot;apartheid&quot; against non-Arabs include former Canadian Minister of Justice <a href="Irwin_Cotler" title="wikilink">Irwin Cotler</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The usage of the terms &quot;Arab&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; has been opposed, because all parties involved in the Darfur conflict&lt;U+2014&gt;whether they are referred to as 'Arab' (particularly <a href="Baggara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baggara</a>/<a href="Janjaweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janjaweed</a>) or as 'African,&lt;U+2019&gt; are equally indigenous. The Janjaweed group recruited mostly from the <a href="Arabization" title="wikilink">Arabized</a> indigenous Africans/Baggara and few Arab <a href="Bedouin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedouin</a> of the northern <a href="Rizeigat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rizeigat</a>; while the majority of Arab groups in Darfur remain uninvolved in the conflict.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="beginning-of-the-conflict">Beginning of the conflict</h3>
<p>The beginning point of the conflict in the Darfur region is typically said to be 26 February 2003, when a group calling itself the <a href="Darfur_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">Darfur Liberation Front</a> (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on <a href="Golo,_Sudan" title="wikilink">Golo</a>, the headquarters of <a href="Jebel_Marra" title="wikilink">Jebel Marra</a> District. Even prior to this attack, however, a conflict had erupted in Darfur, as rebels had already attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys, and the government had engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the <a href="Marrah_Mountains" title="wikilink">Marrah Mountains</a>. The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on the mountain on 25 February 2002 and the Sudanese government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002. Chroniclers Julie Flint and <a href="Alex_de_Waal" title="wikilink">Alex de Waal</a> state that the beginning of the rebellion is better dated to 21 July 2001, when a group of <a href="Zaghawa_people" title="wikilink">Zaghawa</a> and <a href="Fur_people" title="wikilink">Fur</a> met in <a href="Abu_Gamra" title="wikilink">Abu Gamra</a> and swore oaths on the <a href="Qur&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qur'an</a> to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It should be noted that nearly all of the residents of Darfur are Muslim, including the <a href="Janjaweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janjaweed</a>, as well as the government leaders in <a href="Khartoum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khartoum</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>On 25 March 2003, the rebels seized the garrison town of <a href="Tine,_Sudan" title="wikilink">Tine</a> along the Chadian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms. Despite a threat by President <a href="Omar_al-Bashir" title="wikilink">Omar al-Bashir</a> to &quot;unleash&quot; the army, the military had little in reserve. The army was already deployed both to the south, where the <a href="Second_Sudanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Second Sudanese Civil War</a> was drawing to an end, and to the east, where <a href="Eastern_Front_(Sudan)" title="wikilink">rebels</a> sponsored by <a href="Eritrea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eritrea</a> were threatening a newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to <a href="Port_Sudan" title="wikilink">Port Sudan</a>. The rebel <a href="Guerilla_warfare" title="wikilink">guerilla tactic</a> of hit-and-run raids to speed across the semi-desert region proved almost impossible for the army, untrained in desert operations, to counter. However, its aerial bombardment of rebel positions on the mountain was devastating.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>At 5:30 am on 25 April 2003, a joint <a href="Sudan_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Sudan Liberation Army</a> (SLA) and <a href="Justice_and_Equality_Movement" title="wikilink">Justice and Equality Movement</a> (JEM) force in 33 <a href="Toyota_Land_Cruiser" title="wikilink">Toyota Land Cruisers</a> entered <a href="al-Fashir" class="uri" title="wikilink">al-Fashir</a> and attacked the sleeping garrison. In the next four hours, four <a href="Antonov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antonov</a> bombers and helicopter gunships (according to the government; seven according to the rebels) were destroyed on the ground, 75 soldiers, pilots and technicians were killed and 32 were captured, including the commander of the air base, a <a href="Major_General" title="wikilink">Major General</a>. The success of the raid was unprecedented in Sudan; in the twenty years of the war in the south, the rebel <a href="Sudan_People&#39;s_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Sudan People's Liberation Army</a> (SPLA) had never carried out such an operation.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-janjaweed-enter-the-conflict-2003">The Janjaweed enter the conflict (2003)</h3>
<p><img src="Darfur_IDPs_children_sitting.jpg" title="fig:Internally displaced persons&#39; camp" alt="Internally displaced persons&#39; camp" /> The al-Fashir raid was a turning point both militarily and psychologically. The armed forces had been humiliated by the al-Fashir raid and the government was faced with a difficult strategic situation. The incompetent armed forces would clearly need to be retrained and redeployed to fight this new kind of war and there were well-founded concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the army. Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese military intelligence. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, the rebels won 34 of 38 engagements. In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at <a href="Kutum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kutum</a>, killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners; and in mid-July, 250 were killed in a second attack on Tine. The SLA began to infiltrate farther east, threatening to extend the war into <a href="Kordofan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kordofan</a>.</p>
<p>However, at this point the government changed its strategy. Given that the army was being consistently defeated, the war effort depended on three elements: military intelligence, the air force, and the <a href="Janjaweed" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janjaweed</a>, armed <a href="Baggara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baggara</a> herders whom the government had begun directing in suppression of a <a href="Masalit_people" title="wikilink">Masalit</a> uprising in 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;1999. The Janjaweed were put at the center of the new <a href="counter-insurgency" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-insurgency</a> strategy. Though the government consistently denied supporting the Janjaweed, military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a paramilitary force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery. The military planners were doubtlessly aware of the probable consequences of such a strategy: similar methods undertaken in the <a href="Nuba_Mountains" title="wikilink">Nuba Mountains</a> and around the southern oil fields during the 1990s had resulted in massive human rights violations and <a href="forced_displacement" title="wikilink">forced displacements</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The better-armed Janjaweed quickly gained the upper hand. By the spring of 2004, several thousand people &lt;U+2013&gt; mostly from the non-Arab population &lt;U+2013&gt; had been killed and as many as a million more had been driven from their homes, causing a major humanitarian crisis in the region. The crisis took on an international dimension when over 100,000 refugees poured into neighbouring <a href="Chad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chad</a>, pursued by Janjaweed militiamen, who clashed with Chadian government forces along the border. More than 70 militiamen and 10 Chadian soldiers were killed in one gun battle in April. A United Nations observer team reported that non-Arab villages were singled out while Arab villages were left untouched: <img src="Villages_destroyed_in_the_Darfur_Sudan_2AUG2004.jpg" title="fig:Destroyed villages " alt="Destroyed villages " /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 23 Fur villages in the Shattaya Administrative Unit have been completely depopulated, looted and burnt to the ground (the team observed several such sites driving through the area for two days). Meanwhile, dotted alongside these charred locations are unharmed, populated and functioning Arab settlements. In some locations, the distance between a destroyed Fur village and an Arab village is less than 500 meters.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 2011 study in the <em>British Journal of Sociology</em>, &quot;The Displaced and Dispossessed of Darfur: Explaining the Sources of a Continuing State-Led Genocide,&lt;U+201D&gt; examined 1,000 interviews with Black African participants who fled from 22 village clusters in Darfur to various refugee camps in 2003 and 2004. The study found that: 1) The frequency of hearing racial epithets during an attack was 70% higher when it was led by the Janjaweed alone compared to official police forces; it was 80% higher when the Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government attacked together; 2) Risk of displacement was nearly 110% higher during a joint attack compared to when the police or Janjaweed acted alone, and 85% higher when Janjaweed forces attacked alone compared to when the attack was only perpetrated by the Sudanese Government forces; 3) Attacks on food and water supplies made it 129% more likely for inhabitants to be displaced compared to attacks that involved house burnings or killing of persons; 4) Perpetrators knew and took &lt;U+201C&gt;special advantage&lt;U+201D&gt; of the susceptibility of Darfur residents to attacks focused on basic resources. This vulnerability came against the backdrop of increased regional desertification.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u20132005">2004&lt;U+2013&gt;2005</h3>
<p>In 2004, Chad brokered negotiations in <a href="N&#39;Djamena" class="uri" title="wikilink">N'Djamena</a>, leading to the <a href="April_8_Humanitarian_Ceasefire_Agreement" title="wikilink">April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement</a> between the Sudanese government, the JEM, and the SLA. One group which did not participate in the April cease-fire talks or agreement &lt;U+2013&gt; the <a href="National_Movement_for_Reform_and_Development" title="wikilink">National Movement for Reform and Development</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; splintered from the JEM in April. Janjaweed and rebel attacks continued despite the ceasefire, and the <a href="African_Union" title="wikilink">African Union</a> (AU) formed a <a href="Ceasefire_Commission" title="wikilink">Ceasefire Commission</a> (CFC) to monitor its observance.</p>
<p>In August, the African Union sent 150 <a href="Rwanda" title="wikilink">Rwandan</a> troops in to protect the ceasefire monitors. It, however, soon became apparent that 150 troops would not be enough, so they were joined by 150 <a href="Nigeria" title="wikilink">Nigerian</a> troops.</p>
<p>On 18 September, the United Nations Security Council issued <a href="United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1564" title="wikilink">Resolution 1564</a> declaring that the government of Sudan had not met its commitments and expressing concern at helicopter attacks and assaults by the Janjaweed militia against villages in Darfur. It welcomed the intention of the African Union to enhance its monitoring mission in Darfur and urged all member states to support such efforts.</p>
<p>During April 2005, after the government of Sudan signed a ceasefire agreement with <a href="Sudan_People&#39;s_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Sudan People's Liberation Army</a> which led to the end of the <a href="Second_Sudanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Second Sudanese Civil War</a>, the <a href="African_Union_Mission_in_Sudan" title="wikilink">African Union Mission in Sudan</a> force was increased by 600 troops and 80 military observers. In July, the force was increased by about 3,300 (with a budget of 220 million dollars). In April 2005, AMIS was increased to about 7,000.</p>
<p>The scale of the crisis led to warnings of an imminent disaster, with <a href="United_Nations_Secretary-General" title="wikilink">United Nations Secretary-General</a> <a href="Kofi_Annan" title="wikilink">Kofi Annan</a> warning that the risk of genocide was frighteningly real in Darfur. The scale of the Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the <a href="Rwandan_Genocide" title="wikilink">Rwandan Genocide</a>, a parallel hotly denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants and even young children and babies, were more akin to the <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnic cleansing</a> used in the <a href="Yugoslav_wars" title="wikilink">Yugoslav wars</a> and warned that the region's remoteness meant that hundreds of thousands of people were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based <a href="International_Crisis_Group" title="wikilink">International Crisis Group</a> had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of <a href="starvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">starvation</a> and disease.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <img src="Rwandan_Soldiers_airlifted_to_Darfur_17july2005.jpg" title="fig:AMIS soldiers from Rwanda preparing to depart to Darfur in 2005." alt="AMIS soldiers from Rwanda preparing to depart to Darfur in 2005." width="229" /></p>
<p>On 10 July 2005, Ex-SPLA leader <a href="John_Garang" title="wikilink">John Garang</a> was sworn in as Sudan's vice-president.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> However, on 30 July, Garang died in a helicopter crash.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> His death had long-term implications and, despite improved security, talks between the various rebels in the Darfur region progressed slowly.</p>
<p>An attack on the Chadian town of <a href="Adr&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adr&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> near the Sudanese border led to the deaths of three hundred rebels in December. Sudan was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The escalating tensions in the region led to the <a href="government_of_Chad" title="wikilink">government of Chad</a> declaring its hostility toward Sudan and calling for Chadian citizens to mobilise themselves against the &quot;common enemy&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> (See <a href="Chad-Sudan_conflict" title="wikilink">Chad-Sudan conflict</a>)</p>

Kofi Annan called for the deployment of 18,000 international peacekeepers in Darfur to replace the African Union force of 7,000 (<a href="African_Union_Mission_in_Sudan" title="wikilink">AMIS</a>).<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In one incident at <a href="Kalma,_Sudan" title="wikilink">Kalma</a>, seven women, who ventured out of a refugee camp to gather firewood, were gang-raped, beaten and robbed by the Janjaweed.

<p>On 14 September, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, <a href="Minni_Minnawi" title="wikilink">Minni Minnawi</a>, stated that he did not object to the UN peacekeeping force, in opposition to the Sudanese government's view that such a deployment would be an act of Western invasion.

<p>On 2 October, with the UN force plan suspended indefinitely because of Sudanese opposition, the AU announced that it would extend its presence in the region until 31 December 2006.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Two hundred UN troops were sent to reinforce the AU force.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> On 6 October, the UNSC voted to extend the mandate of the <a href="United_Nations_Mission_in_Sudan" title="wikilink">United Nations Mission in Sudan</a> until 30 April 2007.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> On 9 October, the <a href="Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="wikilink">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> listed Darfur as the most pressing food emergency out of the forty countries listed on its <em>Crop Prospects and Food Situation</em> report.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> On 10 October, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="Louise_Arbour" title="wikilink">Louise Arbour</a>, claimed that the Sudanese government had prior knowledge of attacks by Janjaweed militias in Buram, <a href="South_Darfur" title="wikilink">South Darfur</a> the month before, an attack which saw hundreds of civilians killed.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

The measures were said to strengthen existing sanctions by prohibiting US citizens from engaging in oil-related transactions with Sudan (although US companies had been prohibited from doing any business with Sudan since 1997), freezing the assets of complicit parties and denying them entry to the US.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The AU mission's lack of funding and equipment meant that aid workers' work in Darfur was severely limited by fighting. Some warned that the humanitarian situation could deteriorate to levels seen in 2003 and 2004, when UN officials called Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>On 22 October, the Sudanese government told UN envoy <a href="Jan_Pronk" title="wikilink">Jan Pronk</a> to leave the country within three days. Pronk, the senior UN official in the country, had been heavily criticized by the army after he posted a description of several recent military defeats in Darfur to his personal blog.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> On 1 November, the US announced that it would formulate an international plan which it hoped the Sudanese government would find more palatable.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> On 9 November, senior Sudanese presidential advisor Nafie Ali Nafie told reporters that his government was prepared to start unconditional talks with the <a href="National_Redemption_Front" title="wikilink">National Redemption Front</a> (NRF) rebel alliance, but noted he saw little use for a new peace agreement. The NRF, which had rejected the May Agreement and sought a new peace agreement, did not issue a comment.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 2006, Darfur Arabs started their own rebel group, the Popular Forces Troops, and announced on 6 December that they had repulsed an assault by the Sudanese army at Kas-Zallingi the previous day. In a statement, they called the Janjaweed mercenaries who did not represent Darfur's Arabs. They were the latest of numerous Darfur Arab groups to have announced their opposition to the government's war since 2003, some of which had signed political accords with rebel movements.</p>
<p>The same period saw an example of a tribe-based split within the Arab forces, when relations between the farming <a href="Terjem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Terjem</a> and nomadic, camel-herding <a href="Mahria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahria</a> tribes became tense. Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, and Mahria leaders said the Terjem had been stealing their animals. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of South Darfur, said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a seasonal migration, trampling through Terjem territory near the <a href="Bulbul_River" title="wikilink">Bulbul River</a>.

Also on 18 November, the AU reported that Sudanese military and Sudanese-backed militias had launched a ground and air operation in the region which resulted in about 70 civilian deaths. The AU stated that this &quot;was a flagrant violation of security agreements&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>On 25 November, a spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights accused the Sudanese government of having committed &quot;a deliberate and unprovoked attack&quot; against civilians in the town of Sirba on 11 November, which claimed the lives of at least 30 people. The Commissioner's statement maintained that &quot;contrary to the government&lt;U+2019&gt;s claim, it appears that the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on civilians and their property in Sirba,&quot; and that this also involved &quot;extensive and wanton destruction and looting of civilian property&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>The violence has spread over the border to <a href="Chad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chad</a>. On 31 March 2007 Janjaweed militiamen killed up to 400 people in the volatile eastern border region of Chad near Sudan. The attack took place in the border villages of Tiero and Marena. The villages were encircled and then fired upon. Fleeing villagers were later subsequently chased. The women were robbed and the men shot according to the <a href="UNHCR" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNHCR</a>.

The Reuters News Service reported that &quot;Deby's fears that <a href="Mahamat_Nouri" title="wikilink">Nouri</a>'s UFDD may have been receiving Saudi as well as Sudanese support could have pushed him to sign the Saudi-mediated pact with Bashir on Thursday&quot;. Colin Thomas-Jensen, an expert on Chad and Darfur who works International Crisis Group think-tank has grave doubts as to whether &quot;this new deal will lead to any genuine thaw in relations or improvement in the security situation&quot;. Additionally The Chadian rebel Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD) which has fought a hit-and-run war against Chad President Deby's forces in east Chad since 2006 stated that the Saudi-backed peace deal would not stop its military campaign.

After seizing the strategic military airbase at Wadi-Sayedna, the Sudanese soldiers eventually defeated the rebels. A JEM force headed to the Al-Ingaz bridge to cross the <a href="White_Nile" title="wikilink">White Nile</a> into Khartoum, but was repulsed forces.

<p>In January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. <a href="Tijani_Sese" title="wikilink">Tijani Sese</a>, stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document proposed by the joint-mediators in Doha. The proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were also included, this authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would also continue to exist during this period.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In February, the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice-president from the region.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>On 29 January, the leaders of the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and intention to attend the Doha forum on 5 February.

<p>In September 2004, the <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a> estimated that there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to <a href="starvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">starvation</a>. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> and others have estimated even more.</p>

Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 April 2006, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that &quot;extant data, in aggregate, strongly suggest that total excess mortality in Darfur, over the course of more than three years of deadly conflict, now significantly exceeds 450,000,&quot; but this has not been independently verified.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>

<p>In July 2009, the Christian Science Monitor published an op-ed stating that many of the published mortality rates have been misleading because they include a large number of people who have died of disease and malnutrition, as well as those who have died from direct violence.

<p>After an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to have the genocide charges added.

The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied &quot;an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor&quot; and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> In July 2010, <a href="Sudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudan</a>'s president <a href="Omar_al-Bashir" title="wikilink">Omar al-Bashir</a> was finally charged by Hague for orchestrating Darfur genocide, three counts of genocide in Darfur by the <a href="International_Criminal_Court" title="wikilink">International Criminal Court</a>. <a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<p>It is expected that al-Bashir will not face trial in <a href="The_Hague" title="wikilink">The Hague</a> until he is apprehended in a nation which accepts the ICC's jurisdiction, as Sudan is not a state party to the Rome Statute which it signed but didn't ratify.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at <a href="McGill_University" title="wikilink">McGill University</a> in Montreal and a former war crimes prosecutor, says although he may not go to trial, &quot;He will effectively be in prison within the Sudan itself...Al-Bashir now is not going to be able to leave the Sudan without facing arrest.&quot;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> The Prosecutor has publicly warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace.

<p>Some analysts think that the ICC indictment is counterproductive and harms the peace process. Only days after the ICC indictment, al-Bashir expelled 13 international aid organizations from Darfur and disbanded three domestic aid organizations.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> In the aftermath of the expulsions, conditions in the displaced camps deteriorated,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> and women were particularly affected.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Previous ICC indictments, such as the arrest warrants of the LRA leadership in the ongoing war at northern Uganda, were also accused of harming peace processes by criminalizing one side of a war.

<p><a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a> issued a report<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> accusing Russia and the People's Republic of China of supplying arms, ammunition and related equipment to Sudan. This hardware has been transferred to Darfur for use by the government and the Janjaweed(Arab) militias and thus violating a UN arms embargo against Darfur. In its report it showed a photo of <a href="Nanchang_Q-5" title="wikilink">Chinese-made Fantan fighters</a> that have been seen at <a href="Nyala,_Sudan" title="wikilink">Nyala</a>, Darfur and a <a href="Ukraine" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a> <a href="Antonov-26" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antonov-26</a> aircraft (painted white). The report provided evidence (including eyewitness testimony) that the Sudan Air Force has been conducting a pattern of indiscriminate aerial bombings of villages in Darfur and eastern Chad, a country not officially a part of the conflict using ground attack jet fighters and Antonov planes. The report contained an image of a Russian made <a href="Mi-24" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mi-24</a> attack helicopter (reg. n&lt;U+00B0&gt; 928) at Nyala airport in Darfur, Sudan in March 2007. For several years the Sudan Air Force has used this type of attack helicopter for operations during Janjaweed attacks on villages in Darfur. The report also showed evidence that the government has been camouflaging military aircraft and helicopters by painting them white and in doing so, tried to cover up their military use by claiming that they were civilian in nature. The white Antonov-26 aircraft was reported to have been used in Darfur in bombing missions. Recently it has been confirmed by Airforces Monthly Magazine for June 2007, that China and Iran have financed and delivered &quot;newer&quot; aircraft for Sudan. The most recent additions have been 15&lt;U+2013&gt;20 Chinese A5 Fantan ground attack aircraft, which are actually quite obsolete. Also confirmed by Airforces Monthly is the use of Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships and <a href="Mil_Mi-171" title="wikilink">Mil Mi-171Assault</a> Helicopters. They have been photographed painted in UN markings and white color for disguised use in illegal attack missions into the Darfur Region. The base in which they have been seen is at Nyala Airport in the Darfur Region. 8 Hinds have been confirmed operating in the Darfur region. One An-26 transport has been also confirmed delivered from a Russian civil aviation corporation. This aircraft is modified with bomb racks, and painted in U.N. white for illegal bombing missions into Darfur. The aircraft serial 7705 is used, but actually confirmed as 26563. Training for Sudanese crew has recently been confirmed to have been conducted and ongoing at Dezful-Ardestani Air Base in southern Iran. China and Russia denied they had broken UN sanctions. China has a close relationship with Sudan and increased its military co-operation with the government in early 2007. Because of Sudan's plentiful supply of oil, China considers good relations with Sudan to be a strategic necessity that is needed to fuel its booming economy.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a><a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> China also has direct commercial interests in Sudan's oil.

Additionally, it owns the largest single share (40 percent) of Sudan&lt;U+2019&gt;s national oil company, Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> China has also consistently opposed economic and non-military sanctions on Sudan.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a><a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a><a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Recently, however, a 2007 Small Arms Survey research paper suggested that China may be changing its stance on Darfur due to international pressure.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>

<p>Tsim Al Bashir has sought the assistance of numerous non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him, he said- &quot;From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard_Prunier" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Prunier</a>, a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world's most powerful countries have largely limited themselves in expressing concerns and demand for the United Nations to take action in solving the genocide in Darfur. The UN, lacking both the funding and military support of the wealthy countries, has left the African Union to deploy a token force (AMIS) without a mandate to protect civilians. In the lack of foreign political will to address the political and economic structures that underlie the conflict, the <a href="international_community" title="wikilink">international community</a> has defined the Darfur conflict in humanitarian assistance terms and debated the label of &quot;genocide.&quot;<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>

The Russian planes were disguised as UN Planes which violate the Geneva Conventions. The Janjaweed also used Russian small arms to murder and loot, these Russian weapons spread into neighboring Chad.
