<p>The <strong>Pocantico River</strong> is a  <a href="tributary" class="uri" title="wikilink">tributary</a> of the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> in western central <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester County, New York</a>, United States. It rises from Echo Lake, in the <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Town" title="wikilink">town</a> of <a href="New_Castle,_New_York" title="wikilink">New Castle</a> south of the <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Hamlet" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> of <a href="Millwood,_New_York" title="wikilink">Millwood</a>, and flows generally southwest past <a href="Briarcliff_Manor" title="wikilink">Briarcliff Manor</a> to its outlet at <a href="Sleepy_Hollow,_New_York" title="wikilink">Sleepy Hollow</a>. Portions of the towns of <a href="Mount_Pleasant,_New_York" title="wikilink">Mount Pleasant</a>, <a href="Ossining_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">Ossining</a> and <a href="Tarrytown,_New_York" title="wikilink">Tarrytown</a> are within its  <a href="watershed" class="uri" title="wikilink">watershed</a>.</p>
<p>Writer <a href="Washington_Irving" title="wikilink">Washington Irving</a>, who lived in the area for most of his life, was inspired by the undeveloped area above the river's mouth to write his classic &quot;<a href="The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow" title="wikilink">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a>&quot;. Later in the 19th century much of the land was purchased by the <a href="Rockefeller_family" title="wikilink">Rockefeller family</a> as part of their <a href="Kykuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kykuit</a> estate; today much of that land has become <a href="Rockefeller_State_Park_Preserve" title="wikilink">Rockefeller State Park Preserve</a>. A former reservoir used by the city of <a href="New_Rochelle" title="wikilink">New Rochelle</a> has likewise been converted into county-run Pocantico Lake Park. While the river runs predominantly through those parks and suburban land,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is still one of the most <a href="water_pollution" title="wikilink">polluted</a> tributaries of the Hudson.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="course">Course</h2>
<p>In the past the Pocantico was considered to have two different sources, but today it is acknowledged that it rises from Echo Lake in <a href="Echo_Lake_State_Park_(New_York)" title="wikilink">the eponymous state park</a> located in the <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Town" title="wikilink">town</a> of <a href="New_Castle,_New_York" title="wikilink">New Castle</a> between <a href="Saw_Mill_River" title="wikilink">Saw Mill River</a> Road (<a href="New_York_State_Route_100" title="wikilink">New York State Route 100</a>) and the <a href="Taconic_State_Parkway" title="wikilink">Taconic State Parkway</a>, just southwest of the <a href="unincorporated_community" title="wikilink">unincorporated</a> <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Hamlet" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> of <a href="Millwood,_New_York" title="wikilink">Millwood</a>. The lake is  above sea level, in a narrow valley between Cabin Ridge to the east and a similarly steep ridge on the west. Its surrounding terrain is primarily wooded and lightly developed outside of the two roads. At a dam on its south end, the river begins.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after draining the lake, the Pocantico flows under Route 100, which it remains closely parallel to for the next few miles. About  from its source, the stream crosses the town line from New Castle into neighboring <a href="Ossining_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">Ossining</a>, soon forming the boundary between that town and neighboring <a href="Mount_Pleasant,_New_York" title="wikilink">Mount Pleasant</a> on its west. A short distance to the south, the river crosses back under Saw Mill River Road and receives its first <a href="tributary" class="uri" title="wikilink">tributary</a>, the unnamed outlet of <a href="Campfire_Lake" title="wikilink">Campfire Lake</a> to the northeast, as it, Route 100 and the <a href="North_County_Trailway" title="wikilink">North County Trailway</a> diverge from the Taconic. The river, road and trail continue heading to the southwest as the Pocantico begins to form the <a href="Briarcliff_Manor" title="wikilink">Briarcliff Manor</a> <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Village" title="wikilink">village</a> line at the <a href="Chappaqua,_New_York" title="wikilink">Chappaqua</a> Road crossing.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Another 1,200 feet south of that crossing, it recrosses Saw Mill River Road just north of where it merges with the Briarcliff&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Peekskill,_New_York" title="wikilink">Peekskill</a> Parkway (also <a href="New_York_State_Route_9A" title="wikilink">State Route 9A</a>). After flowing under the parkway, it passes just east of downtown Briarcliff Manor and then crosses Saw Mill River Road and the parkway again, meandering a little further to the east into residential neighborhoods, then turning south through the village's Jackson Road Park. After that it flows due south to the immediate east of the parkway, itself to the immediate east of a steep slope.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>After a slight swing east towards the Taconic, the river crosses under the parkway for the last time and continues on a more southwesterly course past  Beech Hill into  <a href="Pocantico_Lakes_Park" title="wikilink">Pocantico Lakes Park</a>. It widens amid swampy areas on either side as it receives <a href="Caney_Brook" title="wikilink">Caney Brook</a> from the north and then becomes Pocantico Lake. Midway along the lake, the municipal boundary leaves the river, putting it entirely within the town of Mount Pleasant. The dam at the lake's south end is at  above sea level, a loss of  from the Pocantico's source at Echo Lake.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>From there, it flows southwestward again. At Old Sleepy Hollow Road it enters <a href="Rockefeller_State_Park_Preserve" title="wikilink">Rockefeller State Park Preserve</a>, at over  the largest of the three <a href="protected_area" title="wikilink">protected areas</a> the river flows through. The road continues to parallel it on the east as it turns south; on the west it is paralleled by the preserve's Pocantico River Trail, which follows it for a mile and a half ().<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> All three cross under Phelps Way (<a href="New_York_State_Route_117" title="wikilink">State Route 117</a>) and turn south.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Within the preserve meanders between hills amidst woodland interrupted by large clearings. Other trails cross it on stone bridges. About  after entering the preserve, the Pocantico crosses into the village of <a href="Sleepy_Hollow,_New_York" title="wikilink">Sleepy Hollow</a>. A short distance to the south, it receives <a href="Rockefeller_Creek" title="wikilink">Rockefeller Creek</a> from the <a href="Pocantico_Hills" title="wikilink">Pocantico Hills</a> to the east. It bends north, away from the road, to receive its last named tributary, <a href="Gory_Brook" title="wikilink">Gory Brook</a>, from the north, where it turns abruptly south again. After another quarter-mile () it crosses under the <a href="Old_Croton_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Old Croton Aqueduct</a>, a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> (NHL), and leaves the preserve, continuing straight through a steep, narrow wooded ravine in a slightly southwesterly direction.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <img src="View_of_Philipsburg_Manor_(Sleepy_Hollow)_New_York.jpg" title="fig:The river, spillway, and impoundment at the Philipsburg Manor House" alt="The river, spillway, and impoundment at the Philipsburg Manor House" /> As it flows between <a href="Sleepy_Hollow_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Sleepy Hollow Cemetery</a> to the west and the village's Douglas Park to the east, the river drops below  in elevation. On the north edge of another residential neighborhood, it bends eastward. After flowing under <a href="U.S._Route_9_in_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 9</a>, it is again impounded, creating the <a href="mill_pond" title="wikilink">mill pond</a> at the <a href="Philipsburg_Manor_House" title="wikilink">Philipsburg Manor House</a>, another NHL.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>From that outlet, it meanders northwest past the former <a href="Tarrytown_Truck_Assembly" title="wikilink">Tarrytown Truck Assembly</a> plant, widening into a <a href="flood_plain" title="wikilink">flood plain</a> as it does. It bends north to pass another village park on the east, then north around that to divide the park from the residential area of Philipse Manor to its north. After flowing under the railroad tracks used by <a href="Metro-North" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metro-North</a>'s <a href="Hudson_Line_(Metro-North)" title="wikilink">Hudson Line</a> and <a href="Amtrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>'s <a href="Empire_Service_(train)" title="wikilink">Empire Service</a>, it flows under the entrance road to the county's Kingsland Point Park and empties into the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
