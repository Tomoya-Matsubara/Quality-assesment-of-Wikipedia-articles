<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Nobles rebelled against the king, and Fa&lt;U+2019&gt;se Footrage, among them, sneaks into the royal castle to kill the king -- or, in other variants, the Eastmure king kills that king because his suit for the queen was rejected. The queen pleads for her life until her child is born. Fa&lt;U+2019&gt;se Footrage tells her that if the baby is a boy, he will die. He sets guards on her, but she gets them drunk and leaves out a window. She has a son in a pigstye. Wise William is sent to seek her, and when he finds her, she persuades him to change her son for his daughter. When the boy is grown, Wise William takes him by the royal castle and tells him the truth. The son kills Fa&lt;U+2019&gt;se Footrage, rewards Wise William, and marries the daughter that his mother raised. </p>
