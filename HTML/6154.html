<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Wayne County authorities began planning for a new airport in the western portions of the county as early as 1927, and the county acquired one square mile of land for an aviation facility, to be called Wayne County Airport, at the corner of Middlebelt and Wick Roads on the northeastern corner of today's airport, the following year. Construction was completed in 1929, and the first official landing took place on February 22, 1930. That same year, Thompson Aeronautical Corporation, a forerunner of <a href="American_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Airlines</a>, inaugurated service from Wayne County. From 1931 until 1945, the airport housed Michigan National Guard operations. The original runway (14/32) was later decommissioned however parts of it remain today as Taxiway Ark, transversing from southeast of Runway 3L/21R through Runway 9L/27R and ending northwest of Runway 3R/21L.</p>
<p>Between 1947 and 1950, county officials decided to expand the small airport to become Detroit's primary airport. The airport was renamed Detroit-Wayne Major Airport in 1947 and over the next three years expanded in size threefold as three more runways were built. (Today's Runways 3L/21R and 9L/27R in 1949 and Runway 4R/22L in 1950) During this time, most commercial traffic shifted from small <a href="Detroit_City_Airport" title="wikilink">Detroit City Airport</a> (now Coleman Young International Airport) northeast of downtown Detroit to the larger <a href="Willow_Run_Airport" title="wikilink">Willow Run Airport</a> over twenty miles west of the city, and ten miles west of Wayne County Airport.</p>
<p>Throughout the early 1950s, more large airlines, including <a href="Pan-Am" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pan-Am</a> and <a href="BOAC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BOAC</a>, began operations at Detroit-Wayne Major. 1956 marked a major turning point in the history of the growing airport. American Airlines agreed to shift operations to Detroit-Wayne, doing so two years later, accompanied by four other carriers. Also, the Commercial Aviation Administration (now the <a href="FAA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FAA</a>) announced that year the inclusion of Detroit-Wayne with the first group of American airports to receive new long-range radar equipment, enabling the airport to become the first inland airport in the United States certified for jet aircraft operations. Also in 1958, the L.C. Smith (South) Terminal was completed to accommodate the new carriers, and the airport was renamed to its present name.</p>
<p>During the next decade, the remaining passenger traffic at Willow Run gradually shifted to Metro Airport, and the North Terminal (later renamed the Davey Terminal) opened in 1966 to accommodate the new arrivals. Growing international traffic necessitated the building of a third terminal, the Michael Berry International Terminal, in 1974. The last of its original three parallel runways (3R/21L) was completed in 1976. A new parallel cross winds runway (9R/27L) opened in 1993.</p>
<p><a href="Republic_Airlines" title="wikilink">Republic Airlines</a> began hub operations in 1984, and its merger with <a href="Northwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northwest Airlines</a> in 1986 expanded the hub greatly. Transpacific operations began in 1987 with non-stop flights to Tokyo. The last of Metro's six runways (4L/22R) was completed in December 2001. The most recent addition to Metro airport, as well as the most significant, was the opening of the mile-long, 122-gate, $1.2 billion McNamara Terminal in the airport's midfield in 2002.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>An interesting footnote: The present Runway 3L/21R has held four different identifier names. When opened in 1949, it was simply Runway 3/21. With the opening of the new west side Runway 3L/21R in 1950, the original 3/21 was renamed 3R/21L. With the opening of the new east side Runway 3R/21L in 1976, it was renamed 3C/21C. With the opening of Runway 4L/22R in December 2001 and the consequent splitting of the field into two sectors (3/21 on the east and 4/22 on the west) Runway 3C/21C was renamed Runway 3L/21R.</p>

<h3 id="michael-berry-terminal">Michael Berry Terminal</h3>
<p>The Berry Terminal was the former international terminal at DTW. All international passengers would arrive at this terminal, go through customs and immigrations, and continue on to their connecting flights by bus to adjacent terminals. With four gates, the terminal is now used for scheduled and charter flights. Upon completion of the new North Terminal, the Berry Terminal will be razed.</p>

<h3 id="edward-h.-mcnamara-terminal">Edward H. McNamara Terminal</h3>
<p>The McNamara Terminal, also referred to as <em>The Northwest WorldGateway</em>, opened on <a href="February_25" title="wikilink">February 25</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>. It was the replacement for the older aged Davey Terminal, which principally housed <a href="Northwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Northwest Airlines</a>.</p>
<p>The terminal is mainly used by Northwest Airlines, but houses several other airlines as well, many of which are affiliated with the <a href="Skyteam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skyteam</a> airline alliance (of which Northwest is a member). It has three concourses, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, which house 122 gates with shopping and dining in the center of &quot;A&quot; concourse (known as &quot;the link&quot;), as well as throughout the concourses. The &quot;A&quot; concourse has a <a href="people_mover" title="wikilink">people mover</a>, known as the &quot;ExpressTram&quot; that gets passengers from one end of the <a href="mile" class="uri" title="wikilink">mile</a>-long (1.6 <a href="kilometer" title="wikilink">km</a>) Concourse A to the other, arriving at the three different boarding stations, &quot;Main&quot;,&quot;North&quot;, and &quot;South&quot;, in less than 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The &quot;A&quot; concourse holds 64 gates with 10 gates being used for international departures and arrivals processing. The &quot;A&quot; concourse is intended for the bigger types of Northwest aircraft and all international arrivals. The concourse holds over 1.5 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a> of <a href="moving_walkway" title="wikilink">moving walkway</a><a href="s" class="uri" title="wikilink">s</a>. <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> and <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> signage is found mostly throughout the terminal (because of regular flights to and from points in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>), as well as other languages located in central areas.</p>
<p>The 10 international gates have dual <a href="jetbridges" class="uri" title="wikilink">jetbridges</a> for a quicker deplaning time. They also contain two exit configurations depending on the arriving flight. Domestic arrivals follow the upper path directly into the terminal while international arrivals proceed downstairs to customs and immigration. The customs and immigration office located in the terminal's lower level is built to quickly process as many as 3,200 passengers an hour. The immigration office leads back up and out into the lobby in the center of the &quot;A&quot; concourse, where passengers can enjoy the <a href="restaurant" title="wikilink">restaurants</a> and <a href="Retailing#Shops_and_stores" title="wikilink">shops</a> on the concourse, or continue on their journey to their final destination.</p>
<p>The &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; concourses currently have 58 gates. The gates are used for Northwest's short-haul and regional flights as well as Continental and Delta flights. All regional flights, with the exception of a limited few <a href="SAAB" class="uri" title="wikilink">SAAB</a> aircraft departing from the end of Concourse B, have <a href="jetbridges" class="uri" title="wikilink">jetbridges</a>, eliminating the need for outdoor boarding.</p>

<p>The airport is accessible from <a href="Interstate_94" title="wikilink">I-94</a>, which is the closest entrance to the Berry and Smith Terminals. The McNamara Terminal is immediately accessible from <a href="Interstate_275_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">I-275</a>. John D.
