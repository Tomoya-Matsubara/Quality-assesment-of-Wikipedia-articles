<p><strong>Howards Alias</strong> are a popular band in the modern <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> underground punk scene. They formed in <a href="1999_in_music" title="wikilink">1999</a> in <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> and blend an eclectic mix of <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="Progressive_music" title="wikilink">progressive</a>, <a href="Punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk</a> and <a href="ska" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska</a> influences into their own musical output.</p>
<p>The band have released three full-length albums. The first - <a href="The_Chameleon_Script" title="wikilink">The Chameleon Script</a> - was released by Good Clean Fun Records in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, with the sophomore and third albums being released on the <a href="Household_Name_Records" title="wikilink">Household Name Records</a> label in <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> and <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> respectively. During their career, Howards Alias have also released a split <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a> with friends <a href="Desa_(band)" title="wikilink">DESA</a> and contributed to several international <a href="Punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk</a> compilation CDs.</p>

<p><img src="Howardsalias.jpg" title="fig:Howards Alias circa 2002. Left to right: Jevon Snell, Matthew Reynolds, Stevie McCusker, Nicholas Horne" alt="Howards Alias circa 2002. Left to right: Jevon Snell, Matthew Reynolds, Stevie McCusker, Nicholas Horne" width="300" /> Howards Alias began at the end of <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>, writing songs mostly in the <a href="ska-punk" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska-punk</a> vein. Even by the time that <a href="The_Chameleon_Script" title="wikilink">The Chameleon Script</a> was released in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, it became apparent that the band's sound was somewhat more mature and defined than the usual <a href="Third_wave_ska" title="wikilink">third wave</a> sound that had been overdone in previous years. The album was critically acclaimed;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> even by notorious <a href="UK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UK</a> rock weekly <a href="Kerrang!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerrang!</a>, who awarded it four &quot;K&quot;s out of five.</p>
<p>The band continued to tour hard with bands such as <a href="Lightyear_(band)" title="wikilink">Lightyear</a>, <a href="Captain_Everything!" title="wikilink">Captain Everything!</a>, <a href="No_Comply" title="wikilink">No Comply</a>, <a href="Sonic_Boom_Six" title="wikilink">Sonic Boom Six</a>, <a href="Desa_(band)" title="wikilink">DESA</a> and <a href="Rx_Bandits" title="wikilink">Rx Bandits</a> (who are generally acknowledged as a major influence in later Howards Alias work).</p>
<p>In early 2004, the band wrote three new songs for inclusion on a split <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a> with <a href="Desa_(band)" title="wikilink">DESA</a>. The EP showed a change of direction from <a href="The_Chameleon_Script" title="wikilink">The Chameleon Script</a>, with the band dropping a lot of the predominant ska influences. This showed a transition that the band cemented with the release of <a href="The_Answer_Is_Never" title="wikilink">The Answer Is Never</a> later in the same year. The album was hailed by critics as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; and &quot;one of the best British rock records ever made&quot;, with <a href="http://www.europunk.net">EuroPunk.net</a> firmly stating &quot;If you claim to love music, you owe it to yourself to own this record, simply as that&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <img src="Howards_Alias_Promo_1.jpg" title="fig:Howards Alias circa early 2005. Left to right: Nicholas Horne, Matthew Reynolds, Jon Warren, Stevie McCusker" alt="Howards Alias circa early 2005. Left to right: Nicholas Horne, Matthew Reynolds, Jon Warren, Stevie McCusker" width="250" /> Longtime drummer Jevon Snell left the band in early <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> (soon to join another <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a>-based band: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/chinmusicrocks">Chin Music</a>), and was replaced by Jon Warren of <a href="http://www.workinlunch.com">Workin Lunch</a>. The band went into the studio with this new line-up to record the follow-up to <a href="The_Answer_Is_Never" title="wikilink">The Answer Is Never</a>. The result was <a href="Beat_Heart,_Beat" title="wikilink">Beat Heart, Beat</a>, which was released in the July of <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Less of a drastic step and more of a natural progression from the previous album, the critical reception of the album was mostly positive. The inclusion of a keyboard (played by the multi-talented Nicholas Horne) was particularly praised for adding a new depth to the Howards Alias sound.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some older fans, however, were alienated by the step even further away from the original <a href="ska-punk" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska-punk</a> roots of the band.</p>
<h2 id="split">Split</h2>
<p>With extensive touring taking its toll on inter-band friendships, bassist Stevie and drummer Jon both left the band after a tour to support the release of <a href="Beat_Heart,_Beat" title="wikilink">Beat Heart, Beat</a>. Guitarist and vocalist <a href="Matthew_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Matthew Reynolds</a> left a message on the band's website and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/howardalias">MySpace</a> informing fans that the band would split up after a final tour. <a href="http://www.petermiles.com">Peter Miles</a> - producer of <a href="The_Answer_Is_Never" title="wikilink">The Answer Is Never</a> and <a href="Beat_Heart,_Beat" title="wikilink">Beat Heart, Beat</a> - was recruited to play bass, and friend <a href="http://www.lloydwilliams.co.uk">Lloyd Williams</a> took drum duties.</p>
<p><a href="Matthew_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Matthew Reynolds</a> spoke in an interview with <a href="http://www.punknews.co.uk">PunkNews.co.uk</a>, regarding the reasons behind the split:</p>
<p>&quot;''I think, like; circumstance, basically. We haven't had an interview yet asking us that so it's kind of a bit weird. I think basically we've been touring for a long time and have played a lot of shows. I don't want to sound like I'm whining, cos' it's nothing like that. We've always been a bit unlucky as far as money is concerned. We're not the best people in the world at handling money. Also, there's not a lot of money to be earned playing to little crowds across the country all the time. We don't have a lot of money and that kind of put pressure on the band, I think, and the tour in July lasted about thirty-something days. It was kind of like we were in a time bomb waiting to happen. It kind of built until the point where we felt we weren't getting on because of the circumstances we were in. No-one was happy, none of us had any stability in life. We'd tour, and that's really fun; but then we'd go home. Not so much me and Nick, but Jon and Steve really felt that they didn't really have any stability at home. Neither of them had a place to live, so they were sleeping on mates' floors and things like that. They couldn't afford to buy food a lot of the time. After a while it kind of got to them both. It got to me as well - I'm not trying to, like, pass the buck, if that's what it sounds like. It was all of us equally, it was kind of like... building up.</p>
<p>''We decided at the end of the tour we'd take some time off and we got together a month or so later and talked about it. We then decided it would be the best thing for all of us just to call it a day really.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Howards Alias split up in October <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, with a final hometown show at The Nexus club in <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a>, <a href="UK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UK</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Thinkpol.jpg" title="fig:Matthew Reynolds with brother Andrew Reynolds performing in Thinkpol, Manchester Satan&#39;s Hollow, 2005" alt="Matthew Reynolds with brother Andrew Reynolds performing in Thinkpol, Manchester Satan&#39;s Hollow, 2005" width="300" /> In January of <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, <a href="Matthew_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Matthew Reynolds</a> revealed plans of a new musical outlet - Thinkpol. Named after the <a href="Thought_police" title="wikilink">Thought Police</a> of <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>'s novel <em><a href="Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="wikilink">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em>, the band had a more straightforward and accessible <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> sound than Howards Alias. The band originally consisted of Matthew Reynolds, brother Andrew Reynolds, Peter Miles and Robert King. Peter Miles left the band and was replaced by Nicholas Horne, fresh from his short stint playing <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a> in <a href="NoComply" class="uri" title="wikilink">NoComply</a>.</p>
<p>Thinkpol released two demo CDs with three songs on each, although many more were written for inclusion on their planned debut album. Whether or not any of these will resurface as Howards Alias songs is currently unknown.</p>
<h2 id="reformation">Reformation</h2>
<p>On September 25 <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the following message appeared on Thinkpol's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thinkpolmusic">MySpace</a>:</p>
<p>''Hello good people of the world.</p>
<p>''Thinkpol are no longer a band.</p>
<p><em>For future reference go to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/howardsalias">www.myspace.com/howardsalias</a></em></p>
<p>This was followed by news of a December tour and fourth album to follow in <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, much to the delight of Howards Alias fans everywhere. The current incarnation of the band includes Matthew Roberts - formerly of <a href="NoComply" class="uri" title="wikilink">NoComply</a> - on saxophone.</p>
<h2 id="skylar">Skylar</h2>
<p><a href="Skylar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skylar</a> is the reggae/traditional ska side-project of four members of the underground UK band Howards Alias. Their original drummer - Jon Warren - was also formerly a member of Howards Alias. The band was formed in March 2004 as an outlet for &quot;Matt to use material he was writing that wasn't suitable for the other band he plays in.&quot; To this end, all Skylar songs and lyrics are written by Matthew Reynolds.</p>
<p>The band have released an <a href="Skylar_(album)" title="wikilink">eponymous debut album</a>, recorded in only eleven hours by Peter Miles. It was self-released in a plastic sleeve with a basic photocopied cover, available from Howards Alias gigs and the band's official website, before being remixed and re-released with new cover art and an additional two songs by Do The Dog Music in April 2006.</p>
<p>On December 4th 2006, Skylar supported the seminal modern reggae outfit <a href="Easy_Star_All-Stars" title="wikilink">Easy Star All-Stars</a> at The Brook in Southampton, UK. Skylar have also been making progress on their sophomore album.</p>
