<p><strong>Technopark Kerala</strong> is an <a href="industrial_park" title="wikilink">industrial park</a> in <a href="Thiruvananthapuram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thiruvananthapuram</a> (also called Trivandrum), <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> dedicated to <a href="electronics" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, <a href="software" class="uri" title="wikilink">software</a>, and other <a href="Information_Technology" title="wikilink">Information Technology</a> (IT) ventures.

<h2 id="history-and-mission">History and mission</h2>
<p>In July 1990, the Government of Kerala conceptualized Technopark as a facility to foster the development of high-technology industries in the state. Technopark was set up under the auspices of Electronics Technology Park, Kerala — an autonomous body under the Department of Information Technology of the government of Kerala.</p>
<p>Technopark's aim was to create infrastructure and provide support required for the development of high-technology companies. Its stated mission is to <em>&quot;Provide, Viably, Superior Environment and Services with Assured Quality of Service to Make Technology Businesses Intrinsically Competitive And Successful, and Promote Regional Development through Synergistic Linkages Between Industry, Government and Academia, based on Continuous Improvement and Innovation&quot;</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The foundation stone for the first building in Technopark was laid on <a href="March_31" title="wikilink">March 31</a> <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a> by then Kerala Chief Minister, <a href="E.K._Nayanar" title="wikilink">E.K. Nayanar</a>. Noted industrialist K.P.P. Nambiar was Technopark's first Chairman. Technopark was formally dedicated to the nation by then Prime Minister, <a href="P.V._Narasimha_Rao" title="wikilink">P.V. Narasimha Rao</a> in 1992.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Since then, Technopark has been growing steadily both in size and employee strength. Park Centre, Pamba and Periyar were the only buildings in the beginning. Since then, Technopark has periodically added new buildings such as Nila, Gayathri and Bhavani. With the inauguration of the 850,000 sq ft. (85,000 sq m.) Thejaswini on <a href="February_22" title="wikilink">February 22</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Technopark became the largest IT Park in India.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Technopark aims to provide all the infrastructure and support facilities needed for IT/ITES and electronics companies to function. In addition to built-up office space, it also provides all utilities as well as the connectivity. This is done either directly or through private partners. In addition, Technopark provides <a href="Business_incubator" title="wikilink">business incubation</a> facilities for start-up firms as well as some social infrastructure for the <a href="personnel" class="uri" title="wikilink">personnel</a> working in the park.</p>
<h3 id="buildings">Buildings</h3>
<p><img src="bhavaniinterior.jpg" title="fig: Interior of Bhavani building" alt=" Interior of Bhavani building" width="200" /> There are currently about a dozen buildings inside the Technopark campus intended for <a href="software_development" title="wikilink">software development</a>. Six of the buildings in Technopark are named after rivers in Kerala—the <a href="Pamba_River" title="wikilink">Pamba</a>, the <a href="Periyar_River" title="wikilink">Periyar</a>, the <a href="Nila_River" title="wikilink">Nila</a>, the <a href="Chandragiri_River" title="wikilink">Chandragiri</a>, the <a href="Gayathri_River" title="wikilink">Gayathri</a> and the <a href="Bhavani_River" title="wikilink">Bhavani</a>. The seventh building is named <em>Thejaswini</em> and was commissioned in February 2007, with over 600,000 sq ft. (60,000 sq m.) of carpet area. There are also independent buildings of private enterprises such as <a href="Tata_Consultancy_Services_Limited" title="wikilink">TCS</a>, M-Square, IVL, NEST, IBS, Leela Group and others inside the Phase I campus. These buildings aggregate to a total of about 3.5 million sq ft. (350,000 sq m.) of space, either complete or under construction.</p>

<h2 id="socio-economic-impact">Socio-economic impact</h2>
<p>Technopark has come to be the single largest source of employment in Kerala,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> with over fifteen thousand people working directly in the facility itself. Thus its impact on the city of Trivandrum has been very significant.</p>
<p>Its cosmopolitan workforce has helped bring diversity to the city's population, along with other national entities like the <a href="Vikram_Sarabhai_Space_Centre" title="wikilink">Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre</a>, Southern Command HQ of the <a href="Indian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Indian Air Force</a>, Government of India offices and major educational institutions.</p>
<p>The Government has plans to setup an IT Corridor along the <a href="Indian_Highways" title="wikilink">National Highway</a>-47 (<a href="NH_47" title="wikilink">NH 47</a>), starting from Technopark towards <a href="Kollam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kollam</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Plans are underway to convert the NH 47 into a four lane, high speed corridor. The need for providing high speed connectivity to the neighbouring city of Kochi has also been emphasised to catalyse the spread of IT, by experts like Kiran Karnik — president of <a href="NASSCOM" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASSCOM</a>, India's apex organisation of IT firms.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The influx of high-income IT professionals has also resulted in the arrival of high-end apartment complexes, retail chains, top class hotels, multiplexes and all the other facilities of a modern city. Other facilities like an improved road network and a high speed transportation avenue along the alignment of the IT Corridor are also in process or being planned.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> A massive <em>International Convention Center</em> is also coming up nearby, at <a href="Akkulam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akkulam</a>. Being built at a cost of Rs 150 Crores ($US 32 Million) by a <a href="joint_venture" title="wikilink">joint venture</a> of the Raheja Group and the Government of Kerala, it will further boost the supporting infrastructure of Technopark.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The increase in air travel brought about by the growing IT industry has also prompted the massive expansion in flight services, especially domestic flights, to and from the nearby <a href="Trivandrum_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Trivandrum International Airport</a>. Connectivity with IT hubs like <a href="Bangalore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangalore</a>, <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a> and <a href="Hyderabad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyderabad</a> have significantly improved in recent months. This has benefited the general populace as well.</p>
<p>The combined disposable income of Technopark employees has brought an infusion of wealth into the entire region through secondary service activities like <a href="retail" class="uri" title="wikilink">retail</a>, <a href="hospitality" class="uri" title="wikilink">hospitality</a>, <a href="transportation" class="uri" title="wikilink">transportation</a>, <a href="financial_services" title="wikilink">financial services</a> and so on. With a potential hundred and fifty thousand IT professionals working in the four Phases of Technopark by 2012,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> the impact on the economy of the city and its suburbs, with a population of about 2 million, will be significant.</p>
