The Palace, which served as the imperial residence and the administrative centre of Japan for most of the <a href="Heian_Period" title="wikilink">Heian Period</a> (from <a href="794" class="uri" title="wikilink">794</a> to <a href="1185" class="uri" title="wikilink">1185</a>), was located at the north-central location of the city in accordance with the Chinese models used for the design of the capital.</p>
<p>The Palace encompassed a large rectangular <a href="#Greater_Palace_(Daidairi)" title="wikilink">walled enclosure</a>, which contained several ceremonial and administrative buildings including the government ministries. Inside this enclosure was the separately walled <a href="#Inner_Palace_(Dairi)" title="wikilink">residential compound</a> of the <a href="Emperor_of_Japan" title="wikilink">emperor</a> or the <em>Inner Palace</em>. In addition to the emperor's living quarters the Inner Palace contained the residences of the imperial consorts as well as certain official and ceremonial buildings more closely linked to the person of the emperor.</p>
<p>The original role of the Palace was to manifest the centralised government model adopted by Japan from <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> in the <a href="7th_century" title="wikilink">7th century</a> and to provide an appropriate setting for the emperor's residence and the conduct of great affairs of state and the accompanying ceremonies. While the residential function of the Palace continued until <a href="12th_century" title="wikilink">12th century</a>, the facilities built for grand state ceremonies began to fall into disuse already in the <a href="9th_century" title="wikilink">9th century</a> due to both the abandonment of several statutory ceremonies and procedures and the transfer of several remaining ceremonies into the smaller-scale setting of the Inner Palace.</p>
<p>From the mid-Heian period, the Palace suffered several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions both emperors and some of the office functions resided outside of the Palace. These events, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further diminish the importance of the Palace as the administrative centre. Finally in <a href="1227" class="uri" title="wikilink">1227</a> the Palace was burned down and never reconstructed again. The Palace site has been built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of the palace is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings as well as limited excavations conducted mainly since the late <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>.</p>

The south-eastern corner of the Greater Palace was located in the middle of the present-day <a href="Nijo_Castle" title="wikilink">Nij&lt;U+014D&gt; Castle</a>. The main entrance to the palace was the <a href="Suzakumon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suzakumon</a> gate (), which formed the northern terminus of the great <a href="Suzaku_Avenue" title="wikilink">Suzaku Avenue</a> that ran through the centre of the city from the <a href="Rash&lt;U+014D&gt;mon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rash&lt;U+014D&gt;mon</a> gate. The palace was thus facing south and presiding over the exactly symmetrical plan of Heian-ky&lt;U+014D&gt;. In addition to the Suzakumon gate, the palace had 13 other gates located symmetrically along the side walls. A  led to each of the gates except for the three along the northern side of the palace, which was coterminous with the northern boundary of the city itself.</p>

It was based on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the <a href="7th_century" title="wikilink">7th century</a> onwards.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The main building within the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in was the  or the Great Audience Hall, facing south at the northern end of the compound. This was a large (approximately 52 m (170 ft) east to west and 20 m (65 ft) north to south<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>) Chinese-style building with white walls, vermilion pillars and green tiled roofs, intended to host the most important state ceremonies and functions. The southern part of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in was occupied by the Twelve Halls where the bureaucracy was seated for ceremonies according to strict order of precedence. The <a href="Heian_Jing&lt;U+016B&gt;" title="wikilink">Heian Jing&lt;U+016B&gt;</a> shrine in Kyoto includes an apparently faithful reconstruction of the Daigokuden in somewhat reduced scale.</p>
<p>It was in the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in that Accession Audiences were held, the <a href="Emperor_of_Japan" title="wikilink">emperor</a> was supposed to preside over early morning deliberations on major state affairs by the by the bureaucracy, receive monthly reports from officials, hold New Year Congratulations and receive foreign ambassadors.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, the practice of the morning deliberations ceased to be followed already by <a href="810" class="uri" title="wikilink">810</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> as did the monthly reports, foreign ambassadors were no longer received for most of the Heian period, and the New Year celebrations were abbreviated and moved into the <a href="#Inner_Palace_(Dairi)" title="wikilink">Dairi</a> by the end of the <a href="10th" class="uri" title="wikilink">10th</a> century, leaving the Accession Audiences and certain Buddhist ceremonials to be the only ones held in the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in.<ref name="McCullough & McCullough pp. 836<U+2013>837&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The Buraku-in was another large rectangular Chinese-style compound, situated to the west of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in. It was built for official celebrations and banquets and used also for other types of entertainment such as archery contest.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Like the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in, also the Buraku-in had a hall at the central northern end of the enclosure overseeing the court. This hall, the , was used by the emperor and courtiers presiding over activities in the Buraku-in. However, like the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in, the Buraku-in also fell gradually into disuse as many functions were moved to the Dairi.<ref name="McCullough & McCullough pp. 836<U+2013>837&quot;/&gt; Its site is one of the few within the Palace area that has been excavated.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from the Inner Palace, the remaining area of the Greater Palace was occupied by ministries, lesser offices, workshops, storage buildings and the large open space of the <em>Banqueting Pine Grove</em> or  to the east of the Dairi. The buildings of the <em>Council of State</em> or  were situated in a walled enclosure immediately to the east of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in, laid out in the typical symmetrical plan of buildings opening to a courtyard in the south. The Palace also housed the , apart from <a href="T&lt;U+014D&gt;-ji" class="uri" title="wikilink">T&lt;U+014D&gt;-ji</a> and <a href="Sai-ji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sai-ji</a>, the only <a href="Buddhism" title="wikilink">Buddhist</a> establishment permitted within the capital.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Its placement right next to the Inner Palace shows the influence of the <a href="Shingon_Buddhism" title="wikilink">Shingon sect</a> during the early Heian Period.</p>
<h2 id="inner-palace-dairi">Inner Palace (Dairi)</h2>
<figure>
<img src="DairiPlan.png" title="Schematic plan of the Inner Palace" alt="Schematic plan of the Inner Palace" width="350" /><figcaption>Schematic plan of the Inner Palace</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Inner Palace or Dairi was located to the north-east of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in, somewhat to the east of the central north-south axis of the Greater Palace. It housed the <em>Throne Hall</em>, the emperor's quarters and the pavilions of the imperial consorts and ladies-in-waiting. The Dairi was enclosed within two sets of walls: the outer walls enclosed in addition to the Dairi itself some household offices, storage areas and the , a walled area of <a href="Shinto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shinto</a> buildings associated with the emperor's religious functions and situated to the west of the Dairi itself, at the geographic centre of the Greater Palace. The principal gate of the larger enclosure was the  located in the southern wall along the median north-south axis of the Dairi.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The Dairi proper, the residential compound of the emperor, was enclosed within another set of walls to the east of Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;wain. It measured approximately 215 m (710 ft) north to south and 170 m (560 ft) east to west.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The main gate was the  at the centre of the southern wall of the Dairi enclosure, immediately to the north of the Kenreimon gate. In contrast to the solemn official Chinese-style architecture of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in and the Buraku-in, the Dairi was built in more intimate Japanese architectural style &lt;U+2014&gt; if still on a grand scale. The Inner Palace represented a variant of the <a href="Shinden_zukuri" title="wikilink">shinden style</a> architecture used in the aristocratic villas and houses of the period. The buildings, with unpainted surfaces and gabled and shingled cypress bark roofs, were raised on elevated wooden platforms and connected to each other with covered and uncovered slightly elevated passages. Between the buildings and passages were gravel yards and small gardens.</p>
<p>The largest building of the Dairi was the <em>Throne Hall</em> or , a building reserved for official functions. It was a rectangular hall measuring approximately 30 m (98 ft) east to west and 25 m (82 ft) north to south,<ref name="McCullough pp. 115<U+2013>116&quot;/&gt; and situated along the median north-south axis of the Dairi, overseeing a rectangular courtyard and facing the Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;meimon gate. An orange tree and a cherry tree stood symmetrically on both sides of the front staircase of the building. The courtyard was flanked on both sides by smaller halls connected to the Shishinden, creating the same configuration of buildings (influenced by Chinese examples) that was found in the aristocratic shinden style villas of the period.</p>
<p><img src="Kyoto_palace02.jpg" title="fig:The Shishinden of the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, built according to Heian period models" alt="The Shishinden of the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, built according to Heian period models" width="300" /> The Shishinden was used for official functions and ceremonies that were not held at the Daigakuden of the Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in complex. It took over much of the intended use of the larger and more formal building from an early date, as the daily business of government ceased to be conducted in the presence of the emperor in the Daigokuden already at the beginning of the <a href="ninth_century" title="wikilink">ninth century</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Connected to this diminishing reliance on the official government procedures described in the <em><a href="Ritsury&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink">Ritsury&lt;U+014D&gt; code</a></em> was the establishment of a personal secretariat to the emperor, the <em>Chamberlain's Office</em> or . This office, which increasingly took over the role of coordinating the work of government organs, was set up in the , the hall to the south-west of the Shishinden.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>To the north of the Shishinden stood the , a similarly constructed hall of somewhat smaller size that was intended to function as the emperor's living quarters. However, beginning already in the <a href="ninth_century" title="wikilink">ninth century</a>, the emperors often chose to reside in other buildings of the Dairi. A third still smaller hall, the  was located next to the north along the main axis of the Dairi. After the Dairi was rebuilt following a fire in <a href="960" class="uri" title="wikilink">960</a>, the regular residence of the emperors moved to the smaller ,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> an east-facing building located immediately to the north-west from Shishinden. Gradually the Seiry&lt;U+014D&gt;den began to be used increasingly for meetings as well, with emperors spending much of their time in this part of the Palace. The busiest part of the building was the , where high-ranking nobles came to meet in the presence of the emperor.</p>
<p>The empress, as well as the official and unofficial imperial consorts, was also housed in the Dairi, occupying buildings in the northern part of the enclosure. The most prestigious buildings, housing the empress and the official consorts, were the ones that had appropriate locations for such use according to the originally Chinese design principles (the , the  and the ), as well as the ones closest to the imperial residence in Seiry&lt;U+014D&gt;den (the  and the ).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The lesser consorts and ladies-in-waiting occupied other buildings in the northern half of the Dairi.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="Imperial_Regalia_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Imperial Regalia of Japan</a>, the emperor's replica of the <a href="Yata_no_kagami" title="wikilink">sacred mirror</a>, was also housed in the  of the Dairi.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The present-day <a href="Kyoto_Gosho" title="wikilink">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a>, located in what was the north-eastern corner of Heian-ky&lt;U+014D&gt;, reproduces much of the Heian-period Dairi, in particular the Shishinden and the Seiry&lt;U+014D&gt;den.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Palace was the first and most important construction to be erected at the new capital of Heian-ky&lt;U+014D&gt;, where the court moved in <a href="794" class="uri" title="wikilink">794</a> following <a href="Emperor_Kanmu" title="wikilink">Emperor Kanmu</a>'s order. The Palace was not completely ready by the time of the move, however&lt;U+2014&gt;the Daigokuden was completed only in <a href="795" class="uri" title="wikilink">795</a>, and the government office in charge of its construction was disbanded only in <a href="805" class="uri" title="wikilink">805</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The grand Chinese-style compounds of Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;d&lt;U+014D&gt;-in and Buraku-in started to fall into disuse quite early on, in parallel with the decline of the elaborate Chinese-inspired <em>ritsury&lt;U+014D&gt;</em> government processes and bureaucracy, which were gradually either abandoned or reduced to empty forms. The centre of gravity of the Palace complex moved into the Inner Palace or Dairi, and the Shishinden and later even the Seiry&lt;U+014D&gt;den overtook the role of the Daigokuden as the places where official government business was conducted.</p>
<p>In parallel with concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began to be regarded as increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: indeed, uninhabited buildings were avoided for the fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the Palace went into decline, and by early <a href="11th_century" title="wikilink">11th century</a> only one Palace gate, the Y&lt;U+014D&gt;meimon in the east wall, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the Palace by the first half of 11th century.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Fires were a constant problem with the palace compound constructed almost entirely of wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in <a href="876" class="uri" title="wikilink">876</a>, <a href="1068" class="uri" title="wikilink">1068</a> and in <a href="1156" class="uri" title="wikilink">1156</a> despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of <a href="1177" class="uri" title="wikilink">1177</a> which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never rebuilt again. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in <a href="1063" class="uri" title="wikilink">1063</a> and was never rebuilt.<ref name="McCullough pp. 174<U+2013>175&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>As of <a href="960" class="uri" title="wikilink">960</a>, also the Dairi was repeatedly destroyed by fires, but it was systematically rebuilt and used as the official imperial residence until the late <a href="12th_century" title="wikilink">12th century</a>.<ref name="McCullough pp. 174<U+2013>175&quot;/&gt; During periods of rebuilding the Dairi following fires, the emperors had to stay frequently at their secondary  palaces within the city. Often these secondary palaces were provided to the emperor by the powerful <a href="Fujiwara_clan" title="wikilink">Fujiwara</a> family, which especially in the latter part of the Heian period exercised <em>de facto</em> control of politics through providing the consorts to successive emperors. Thus the residences of the maternal grandparents of the emperors started to usurp the residential role of the Palace already before the end of the Heian period. The institution of the rule by retired emperors or the  from <a href="1086" class="uri" title="wikilink">1086</a> further added to the declining importance of the Palace as the retired emperors exercised power from their own residential palaces inside and outside of the city.</p>
<p>After a fire in <a href="1177" class="uri" title="wikilink">1177</a>, the original Palace complex was abandoned and the emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former <em>sato-dairi</em>) within the city and villas outside of it. And in <a href="1227" class="uri" title="wikilink">1227</a> a fire finally destroyed what remained of the Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In <a href="1334" class="uri" title="wikilink">1334</a> <a href="Emperor_Go-Daigo" title="wikilink">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> issued an edict to the effect of rebuilding the Greater Palace, but no resources were found to support this and project came to nothing.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The present <a href="Kyoto_Gosho" title="wikilink">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a> is located immediately to the west of the site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>While the Palace itself has been completely destroyed, significant amount of information regarding it has been obtained from contemporary and almost contemporary sources. The Heian Palace figures as a background for action in many Heian period literary texts, both fiction and non-fiction These provide important information on the Palace itself, court ceremonies and functions held there as well as everyday routines of the courtiers living or working there. Notable examples include the <a href="Tale_of_Genji" title="wikilink">Tale of Genji</a> by <a href="Murasaki_Shikibu" title="wikilink">Murasaki Shikibu</a>, the so-called <a href="Pillow_Book" title="wikilink">Pillow Book</a> by <a href="Sei_Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nagon" title="wikilink">Sei Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nagon</a> and the chronicle <a href="Eiga_Monogatari" title="wikilink">Eiga Monogatari</a>. In addition, paintings in certain <a href="emakimono" class="uri" title="wikilink">emakimono</a> picture scrolls depict (sometimes fictional) scenes that took place at the Palace; the Genji Monogatari Emakimono, dating from about <a href="1130" class="uri" title="wikilink">1130</a> is perhaps the best-known example. Finally, there are also partially damaged contemporary maps of the palace from the 10th and 12th centuries showing the layout and function of the buildings within Dairi.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to literary evidence, archaeological excavation conducted mainly since the late 1970s have revealed further information about the Palace. In particular, the existence and location of buildings such as the Buraku-in compound has been verified against the contemporary documentary sources.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
