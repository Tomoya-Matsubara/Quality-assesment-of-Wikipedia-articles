<p><strong><em>Supernature</em></strong> is the third <a href="album" class="uri" title="wikilink">album</a> by British <a href="Electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic</a> duo <a href="Goldfrapp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goldfrapp</a>. It was released by <a href="Mute_Records" title="wikilink">Mute Records</a> on 22 August 2005 in the United Kingdom, and was the duo's first album to receive mixed reviews. Most critics complimented its blend of <a href="Pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> and electronic music, while others called it uninspiring.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Supernature</em> was a top five album in Goldfrapp's native United Kingdom, and its lead single &quot;<a href="Ooh_La_La_(Goldfrapp_song)" title="wikilink">Ooh La La</a>&quot; was a top five single.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In North America, where &quot;<a href="Number_1_(song)" title="wikilink">Number 1</a>&quot; was promoted as the first single, the album was released on 7 March 2006, peaking low on the <a href="Billboard_charts" title="wikilink">Billboard charts</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The album represented a change in Goldfrapp's musical style, and featured pop and electronic-dance music; inspirations were <a href="Disco" title="wikilink">disco music</a> artist <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a> and <a href="New_Wave_(music)" title="wikilink">New Wave</a> band <a href="New_Order" title="wikilink">New Order</a>. <em>Supernature</em> received a <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> nomination in 2007 for &quot;<a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Electronic/Dance_Album" title="wikilink">Best Electronic/Dance Album</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In January 2006, the album was certified <a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">platinum</a> in the UK, and has sold one million copies worldwide as of early 2007.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recording-and-production">Recording and production</h2>
<p><em>Supernature</em> contains music in the same pop and electronic-dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's 2003 album <em><a href="Black_Cherry_(album)" title="wikilink">Black Cherry</a></em> (especially <em>Black Cherry</em>'s singles &quot;<a href="Strict_Machine" title="wikilink">Strict Machine</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Twist_(Goldfrapp_song)" title="wikilink">Twist</a>&quot;), but it focuses on subtle <a href="hook_(music)" title="wikilink">hooks</a> instead of large choruses. Goldfrapp's lead singer <a href="Alison_Goldfrapp" title="wikilink">Alison Goldfrapp</a> called the album's writing process &quot;an electronic, glam cross between <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> and north-east <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and said that she was inspired by artists such as <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a> and <a href="New_Order" title="wikilink">New Order</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Goldfrapp and <a href="Will_Gregory" title="wikilink">Will Gregory</a> recorded the bulk of <em>Supernature</em> in late 2004 in the countryside of <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a>, England&lt;U+2014&gt;the same place they recorded <em>Black Cherry</em>. They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was &quot;very basic&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Goldfrapp has said that the duo respect certain boundaries when writing <a href="lyrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyrics</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> referring to their studio sessions as a &quot;democratic affair&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The lyrical content of the song &quot;Number 1&quot;, which became the album's second single, is about the importance and meaning of relationships, even though they do not necessarily last.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="College_Music_Journal" title="wikilink">College Music Journal</a></em>, Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create <a href="dance_music" title="wikilink">dance music</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, the singles released from <em>Black Cherry</em> were successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Although this made the duo nervous, &quot;<a href="Ooh_La_La_(Goldfrapp_song)" title="wikilink">Ooh La La</a>&quot; was the group's first song to feature the <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">electric guitar</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognizable rhythm.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="Four-on-the-floor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Four-on-the-floor</a> <a href="bass_drum" title="wikilink">bass drums</a> are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the <a href="piano_pop" title="wikilink">piano</a> <a href="ballad" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballad</a> &quot;Let It Take You&quot; features evening-effects composed on a synthesizer.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> &quot;You Never Know&quot; begins with Alison Goldfrapp executing a synthesized voice, supported by both <a href="timbre" title="wikilink">pads</a> and synthesizers.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Goldfrapp and Gregory have cited &quot;Satin Chic&quot; as their favourite song on <em>Supernature</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Alison Goldfrapp named the Roland String synth as one of her favourite <a href="musical_keyboard" title="wikilink">keyboards</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> &quot;Number 1&quot; features an old synth and a <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass</a> arrangement that the group began to use frequently after recording the song. Another Roland String model, the SH-09, is another favourite; she played the duo's song &quot;<a href="Train_(Goldfrapp_song)" title="wikilink">Train</a>&quot; (2003) on it and enjoys the sounds that it makes.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Goldfrapp was also impressed by a Russian synth, enamored with its <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian-language writing</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critical-response">Critical response</h2>
<p><em>Supernature</em> received mixed reviews from pop music critics. In a review for <a href="PopMatters" class="uri" title="wikilink">PopMatters</a>, Adrien Begrand said that &quot;although <em>Supernature</em> lacks the imagination of <em>Felt Mountain</em> and the saucy brilliance of <em>Black Cherry</em>, it doesn't pander to the pop crowd&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> said the album was &quot;toxic and delicious&quot; and that &quot;<em>Supernature</em> will make you do bad things — and like it&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, <a href="Pitchfork_Media" title="wikilink">Pitchfork Media</a> reviewer Nitsuh Abebe was less impressed, and wrote that the album's songs &quot;keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH.com wrote a review for every song on <em>Supernature</em>, and although he felt that it was a &quot;curious, rather than classic, record&quot;, he criticized it for &quot;fading out early on, with poor, low quality songs at the end which leave the listener feeling cheated&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a> reviewer Heather Phares called <em>Supernature</em> &quot;Goldfrapp's most accessible album&quot; and named &quot;Ooh La La&quot; as its best song.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In a review for Canadian-based <a href="Jam!" title="wikilink"><em>Jam</em> Canoe</a>, Andrew Carver praised the different sounds on <em>Supernature</em>, which range from &quot;a blend of future noise&quot; to &quot;crushed velvet corruption&quot;; he described the album as &quot;one sharp recording&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Jessica Suarez of <em><a href="Spin_magazine" title="wikilink">Spin</a></em> magazine compared &quot;Ooh La La&quot; with <em>Black Cherry</em>'s &quot;Strict Machine&quot;, saying that &quot;Ooh La La&quot; sounds &quot;so simplistic that [its] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy&quot;. She praised &quot;Ride a White Horse&quot; and &quot;Fly Me Away&quot; for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's &quot;velvet-soft vocals, which stay that way even when heavily processed&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A less favourable reception came from <em><a href="Stylus_magazine" title="wikilink">Stylus</a></em> magazine reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated &quot;<em>Supernature</em> is not a great album&quot; and called several of its tracks too &quot;dull&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine included the album in its list of the top fifty albums of 2006, ranking it at number thirty-two.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> At the <a href="Grammy_Awards_of_2007" title="wikilink">2007 Grammy Awards</a>, Goldfrapp received two nominations for &quot;<a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Electronic/Dance_Album" title="wikilink">Best Electronic/Dance Album</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Dance_Recording" title="wikilink">Best Dance Recording</a>&quot; for &quot;Ooh La La&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
