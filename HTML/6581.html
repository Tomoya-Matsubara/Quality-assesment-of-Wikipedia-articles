<p>The <strong>Battle of the Barracks</strong> () was a series of engagements between the <a href="Croatian_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Croatian National Guard</a> (<em>Zbor narodne garde</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; ZNG, later renamed the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a>) and the <a href="Law_enforcement_in_Croatia" title="wikilink">Croatian police</a> on one side and the <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (<em>Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; JNA) on another in September–November 1991. The battle took place around numerous JNA posts throughout <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>, starting with Croatian forces blockading the JNA barracks, weapons storage depots and other facilities. It formally began on 14 September, and its objective was to neutralise the JNA positions in the ZNG-held territory and secure arms and ammunition to the poorly equipped ZNG.</p>
<p>The Battle of the Barracks was an escalation of the conflict between Croatian authorities and the <a href="Croatian_Serb" title="wikilink">Croatian Serbs</a> who <a href="Log_Revolution" title="wikilink">openly revolted</a> in August 1990 and the JNA efforts to preserve the <a href="SFR_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslav federation</a>. At the same time, Croatia made moves towards <a href="Independence_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">achieving its independence</a> from Yugoslavia. The Battle of the Barracks briefly preceded the start of the <a href="1991_Yugoslav_campaign_in_Croatia" title="wikilink">JNA's campaign in Croatia</a>—itself amended in early September to add relief of the blockaded barracks to the operation plans. However, the JNA's advance was largely curbed by the ZNG, and it relieved only few JNA facilities.</p>
<p>The ZNG and the police captured small and isolated JNA posts, as well as a number of large weapons depots and barracks, including the entire 32nd (<a href="Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din</a>) Corps of the JNA. The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weapons, including 250 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces and large supply of <a href="small_arms" title="wikilink">small arms</a> and ammunition—proving crucial in defence against the JNA advances in the early stage of the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a>. Some of the JNA facilities surrendered without any fight, while others put up armed resistance to the takeover. In some places, this caused civilian casualties as the barracks were situated in urban areas. Legal charges of abuse or killing of captured JNA personnel, as well as charges with war crimes against civilian population were filed in Croatia, but most defendants remain at large.</p>
<p>In November, the JNA and Croatia reached several agreements to end the blockade and pull out the JNA out of Croatia. The pullout was completed by 4 January 1992, except in areas around <a href="Dubrovnik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dubrovnik</a>, and on the islands of <a href="Vis_(island)" title="wikilink">Vis</a> and <a href="Lastovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lastovo</a>. The JNA maintained its presence there until the summer of 1992. As the JNA withdrew from the areas it controlled in Croatia, it was replaced by the <a href="UNPROFOR" title="wikilink">UN peacekeepers</a> agreed upon by the <a href="Vance_plan" title="wikilink">Vance plan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In 1990, following the <a href="Croatian_parliamentary_election,_1990" title="wikilink">electoral defeat</a> of the government of the <a href="Socialist_Republic_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Socialist Republic of Croatia</a>, ethnic tensions worsened. The <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (<em>Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; JNA) confiscated Croatia's <a href="Territorial_Defense_Forces_(Yugoslavia)" title="wikilink">Territorial Defence</a> (<em>Teritorijalna obrana</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; TO) weapons to minimize resistance.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an <a href="Log_Revolution" title="wikilink">open revolt</a> of the <a href="Serbs_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Croatian Serbs</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the <a href="Dalmatia" title="wikilink">Dalmatian</a> hinterland around <a href="Knin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knin</a>, (approximately  northeast of <a href="Split,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Split</a>),<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> parts of the <a href="Lika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lika</a>, <a href="Kordun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kordun</a>, <a href="Banovina_(region)" title="wikilink">Banovina</a> and <a href="eastern_Croatia" title="wikilink">eastern Croatia</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Republic_of_Serbia_(1990&lt;U+2013&gt;2006)" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, supported by <a href="Socialist_Republic_of_Montenegro" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> and Serbia's provinces of <a href="Vojvodina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vojvodina</a> and <a href="Autonomous_Province_of_Kosovo_and_Metohija" title="wikilink">Kosovo</a> unsuccessfully tried to obtain <a href="Yugoslav_Presidency" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Presidency</a>'s approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The denied request, and <a href="Pakrac_clash" title="wikilink">a bloodless skirmish</a> between Serb insurgents and <a href="Lu&lt;U+010D&gt;ko_Anti-Terrorist_Unit" title="wikilink">Croatian special police</a> in March,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> prompted the JNA itself to ask the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies, the JNA was denied on 15 March. Serbian President <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s control.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to <a href="Plitvice_Lakes_incident" title="wikilink">the first fatalities</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In early April, leaders of Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control, viewed by the <a href="Government_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Government of Croatia</a> as a breakaway region, with Serbia.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve <a href="battalion" title="wikilink">battalions</a> adopting military organization of the units. In addition there were 9,000–10,000 regionally organized reserve police. The reserve police was set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but the reserve force lacked weapons.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> As a response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the <a href="Croatian_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Croatian National Guard</a> (<em>Zbor narodne garde</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; ZNG) in May.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This was achieved by <a href="wikt:Amalgamation" title="wikilink">amalgamation</a> of the special police battalions into four all-professional guards brigades consisting at that point of approximately 8,000 troops combined, and their subordination to the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a> headed by retired JNA <a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Martin_&lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj" title="wikilink">Martin &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj</a>. The regional police, expanded to 40,000 by then, was also attached to the ZNG and reorganized in 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. However the guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully armed with <a href="small_arms" title="wikilink">small arms</a>, while heavier weapons, as well as a command and control structure were lacking throughout the ZNG.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to use of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> weapons taken from museums and film studios.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> At the time, Croatian stockpile of weapons consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000-strong special police was established then to replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved in the January–September 1991. The initial plan of <a href="Croatian_President" title="wikilink">Croatian President</a> <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a> was to win support from the <a href="European_Community" title="wikilink">European Community</a> (EC) and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> for Croatia, and dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Capturing the JNA barracks and storage depots was first advocated by &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj in late 1990. He urged Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man again to adopt the plan in early 1991, and in summer of that year while the JNA fought <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>'s TO in the <a href="Ten-Day_War" title="wikilink">Ten-Day War</a> in June–July 1991. His calls were echoed by <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;ime_&lt;U+0110&gt;odan" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0160&gt;ime &lt;U+0110&gt;odan</a>, who replaced &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj as the Defence Minister in July. &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj remained in command of the ZNG though.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to defence even though actions of the JNA appeared coordinated with the Croatian Serb military.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The impression was reinforced by <a href="buffer_zone" title="wikilink">buffer zones</a> the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG—the JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of territory they captured before the JNA arrived. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from the Serbia's TO and <a href="Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Serbia)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> stocks.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 1991, &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj and &lt;U+0110&gt;odan's demands were backed up by a number of <a href="Croatian_Parliament" title="wikilink">Croatian Parliament</a> members during a parliamentary debate. This led Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man to sack &lt;U+0110&gt;odan the same month he was appointed the Defence Minister, and &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj resigned his post on 3 August. Nonetheless, deteriorating situation in the east of Croatia,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> including JNA forces removing the ZNG from <a href="Baranja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baranja</a> and intermittent fighting around <a href="Osijek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osijek</a>, <a href="Vukovar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vukovar</a> and <a href="Vinkovci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vinkovci</a>,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> as well as increasing losses and growing conviction that the JNA actively supports the Croatian Serb revolt, forced Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the JNA to withdraw to its barracks by the end of the month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider the JNA an army of occupation and take corresponding action.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> On 1 September, the EC proposed a cease-fire and a peace conference was accepted by Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man, despite his ultimatum demanding the JNA to return to its barracks by 31 August, and by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency, <a href="Stjepan_Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Stjepan Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The move was motivated by Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's impression that the conference would drag endlessly while the ZNG loses ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

Those included the entire stocks of the JNA 32nd (Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din) Corps and nearly all the weapons previously confiscated from the Croatia's TO.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The JNA lost control of eight brigades, including one armoured and two mechanized brigades, and three artillery regiments, while additional forces in the JNA Fifth Military District and the Military-Maritime District remained pinned down by the blockade.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Significance of the Battle of the Barracks was reinforced by introduction of a <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> (UN) <a href="United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_713" title="wikilink">arms embargo</a> on 25 September.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The Battle of the Barracks resulted in a very large increase of ZNG/HV capabilities—allowing complete arming of its existing units, raising of additional 40–42 brigades and fielding 200,000 troops in addition to 40,000 police by the end of the year.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> In the battle, the ZNG/HV captured 250 tanks, 400–500 heavy artillery pieces, 180,000 small arms and 2 million tonnes of ammunition. In addition, 3,000 officers left the JNA and joined the HV.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>While there are is no information on the total number of troops or casualties involved on either side, the JNA garrisons in Croatia were significantly undermanned at the time.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> The JNA <a href="order_of_battle" title="wikilink">order of battle</a> developed in 1980s specified a handful of battalions at full <a href="combat_readiness" title="wikilink">combat readiness</a> in Croatia. Those were elements of the 140th Mechanised Brigade in Zagreb, the 31st Armoured Brigade in <a href="Dugo_Selo" title="wikilink">Dugo Selo</a>, just to the east of Zagreb, the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade in Osijek, the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade in &lt;U+0160&gt;ibenik and the 139th Marine Infantry Brigade in Pula.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> In 1990, the &quot;A&quot; classification, requiring 60–100% troop levels,<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> was assigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade in Jastrebarsko, a battalion of the 622nd Motorised Brigade in <a href="Petrinja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrinja</a>,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade in Rijeka, and the 265th Mechanised Brigade in Bjelovar and Koprivnica.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> The 221st Motorised Brigade, based in Knin was reinforced with &quot;A&quot; class armoured and mechanised battalions.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> In addition, an armoured battalion was added to the 622nd Mechanised Brigade, and a mechanised battalion to JNA garrisons in Vinkovci and Vukovar each in May 1991.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Likewise, Croatian forces were strained between the blockade and manning the positions held against the JNA and Croatian Serb militias elsewhere.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Surrendered JNA troops were either transported to Serbia, exchanged for <a href="prisoners_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoners of war</a> captured elsewhere, or provided civilian clothing and released.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>Both in 1991 and years later, &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj criticised Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's decision to disregard his advice to attack the JNA barracks earlier than September—specifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in June–July 1991. He argued that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of strategic situation in Croatia, would serve Croatian defensive needs the best. Furthermore, he claimed that the JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise required forces and that all prerequisites for a <a href="decisive_victory" title="wikilink">decisive victory</a> against the JNA were met.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Tus thought that Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man kept postponing the blockade because of the international community exerted a pressure against confrontation with the JNA,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> while <a href="Zdravko_Tomac" title="wikilink">Zdravko Tomac</a>, deputy <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">prime minister</a> of a <a href="national_unity_government" title="wikilink">national unity government</a> at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj's view was militarily correct, Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's position was politically better.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt; conversely claimed that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces confronted it earlier on because JNA capabilities declined during the summer of 1991.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vance-plan">Vance plan</h3>

<p>The JNA campaign in Croatia ended in a stalemate, leading the belligerents to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> formulated as the <a href="Vance_plan" title="wikilink">Vance plan</a>—a result of a diplomatic mission by the <a href="Special_Envoy" title="wikilink">Special Envoy</a> of the <a href="Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> <a href="Cyrus_Vance" title="wikilink">Cyrus Vance</a>, aided by United States diplomat <a href="Herbert_Okun" title="wikilink">Herbert Okun</a>,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> and <a href="Under-Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> for Special Political Affairs <a href="Marrack_Goulding" title="wikilink">Marrack Goulding</a>,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> to <a href="SFR_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a> aimed at a negotiated end of hostilities in Croatia. The plan proposed a ceasefire, the protection of civilians in specific areas designated as <a href="United_Nations_Protected_Area_(UNPROFOR)" title="wikilink">UN Protected Areas</a> and deployment of a UN force to Croatia. The Vance plan provided for the end of the Croatian blockade of the JNA barracks, the withdrawal of all JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of delivery of humanitarian aid.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a <a href="UNPROFOR" title="wikilink">UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia</a>, later initiated through the subsequent <a href="United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_721" title="wikilink">United Nations Security Council Resolution 721</a> of 27 November.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the last ceasefire agreement, the UN peacekeepers only started to deploy on 8 March 1992.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="evacuation-of-the-jna">Evacuation of the JNA</h3>
<p>The JNA continued to evacuate following the Geneva Accord. The remaining seven JNA facilities in Rijeka area were evacuated throughout November, and the last barracks evacuated were those in <a href="Trsat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trsat</a> on 10 December.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In &lt;U+0160&gt;ibenik, the JNA evacuated two barracks and four depots from 25 November until 24 December, turning the confiscated Croatian TO weapons over to the HV on 10 December—but the weapons remained in a sealed storage under ECMM supervision until 25 December, as required by the &lt;U+017D&gt;itni&lt;U+0107&gt; agreement. The bulk of the evacuation took place by rail via Knin, and a part of the force was moved by sea to Montenegro. The evacuation agreement required, as in case of Zadar evacuation, removal of the evacuated units from Croatian soil, but the JNA fulfilled that commitment only in a part.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> The &quot;Divulje&quot; base of the JNA near <a href="Trogir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trogir</a> started to evacuate by sea on 4 December, after an additional agreement signed by Rudolf and Mladeni&lt;U+0107&gt; regulating surrender of the TO weapons to the HV and evacuation from &quot;Lora&quot; naval base in Split.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>The evacuation was halted once again when it was determined that some of the TO weapons are missing from the JNA facilities in Split. The issue was resolved through an agreement of 18 December made between Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;eta and Agoti&lt;U+0107&gt;, stipulating that the JNA would provide the HV with the missing weapons from its own stocks, and the evacuation resumed. Since the JNA did not have sufficient weapons to achieve that in Split, a Yugoslav Navy ship delivered  of weapons and ammunition from <a href="Kumbor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kumbor</a> in Montenegro to Split on 1 January 1992.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The last JNA forces left the area of Split on 4 January.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Elsewhere in Croatia, the JNA also evacuated its facilities. Pullout from &quot;Mar&lt;U+0161&gt;al Tito&quot; and &quot;Kerestinec&quot; barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> and was completed by the end of 1991.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> <a href="Istria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Istria</a> was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, turning over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV. Quantity of the TO weapons turned over in Istria, where the JNA evacuated 78 facilities, was sufficient to arm two combat brigades.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor and unsuccessful HV attack on &quot;Meku&lt;U+0161&gt;je&quot; barracks in Karlovac.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment,<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> When its troops eventually pulled out from Croatia, JNA left their equipment to the <a href="Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina" title="wikilink">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a>,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The JNA maintained positions near <a href="Dubrovnik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dubrovnik</a> until July,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-crimes">War crimes</h2>
<p>Croatian authorities charged deputy head of the Bjelovar police Operations department and three special police force members with death of five JNA prisoners and shooting of a civilian in the aftermath of the Bjelovar barracks surrender. They were acquitted after 12 years of legal proceedings, after the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> ordered their trial repeated twice.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Head of Bjelovar crisis centre was also charged with war crimes in 2012, but  his trial is still pending.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Croatia also charged numerous JNA officers who held posts in the blockaded garrisons. In Osijek alone, 13 JNA officers were charged with war crimes against civilian population, including causing death of 307 and severe injuries to 171 persons, but none were arrested .<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>There were war crime charges brought against JNA commander of the 32nd (Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din) Corps, General <a href="Vladimir_Trifunovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Vladimir Trifunovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>.

In early 1996, Trifunovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was pardoned and released,<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> and the Yugoslav authorities paid him 62,000 <a href="Euro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euro</a> compensation for spending nearly two years in a prison.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In 2013, Trifunovi&lt;U+0107&gt; formally requested re-trial in Croatia.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
