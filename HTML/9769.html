<p><strong>Lafayette Ronald Hubbard</strong> (March 13, 1911 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 24, 1986), better known as <strong>L. Ron Hubbard</strong> (and often referred to by his initials, <strong>LRH</strong>), was an American <a href="pulp_magazines" title="wikilink">pulp fiction</a> author turned religious leader who founded the <a href="Church_of_Scientology" title="wikilink">Church of Scientology</a>. After establishing a career as a writer of pulp fiction, becoming best known for his <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> and <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> stories, he developed a self-help system called <a href="Dianetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dianetics</a> which was first published in 1950. He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and rituals as part of a <a href="new_religious_movement" title="wikilink">new religious movement</a> that he called <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a>. His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Although many aspects of Hubbard's life are disputed, there is general agreement about its basic outline.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Born in <a href="Tilden,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Tilden, Nebraska</a>, he spent much of his childhood in <a href="Helena,_Montana" title="wikilink">Helena, Montana</a>. He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a>, was posted to a U.S. naval base on <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>. He attended <a href="George_Washington_University" title="wikilink">George Washington University</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> at the start of the 1930s before beginning a career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served in the U.S. Navy during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, commanding vessels in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. He ended the war in hospital and a few years later developed Dianetics, &quot;the modern science of mental health&quot;. He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization. During the late 1960s and early 1970s he spent much of his time at sea aboard his personal fleet of ships as Commodore of the <a href="Sea_Organization" title="wikilink">Sea Organization</a>, an elite inner group of Scientologists. He returned to the United States in the mid-1970s but went into seclusion at the end of the decade, dying on a ranch near <a href="Creston,_California" title="wikilink">Creston, California</a> in January 1986.</p>
<p>Hubbard was and remains an extremely controversial figure and many details of his life are still disputed. The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in <a href="hagiography" title="wikilink">hagiographic</a> terms, drawing on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer, world traveler and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines including photography, art, poetry and philosophy. His critics have characterized him as a liar, a charlatan and a madman, and many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen concludes that the Church of Scientology's narrative &quot;becomes meaningful only if it is perceived as a legend or a myth,&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> though the Church itself rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is anything other than plain historical fact.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a former United States Navy sailor, and Ledora May Waterbury, who had originally trained as a teacher.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> After moving to <a href="Kalispell,_Montana" title="wikilink">Kalispell, Montana</a>, the family settled in 1913 in the city of Helena.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Hubbard's father re-enlisted in the Navy in April 1917, while his mother Ledora May worked as a clerk for the state government.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology describe Hubbard as &quot;a child prodigy of sorts&quot; who rode a horse before he could walk and was able to read and write by the age of four.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A Scientology profile says that he was brought up on his grandfather's &quot;large cattle ranch in Montana&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> where he spent his days &quot;riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> His grandfather is described as a &quot;wealthy Western cattleman&quot; from whom Hubbard &quot;inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Hubbard was said to have become a &quot;<a href="blood_brother" title="wikilink">blood brother</a>&quot; of the <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> <a href="Blackfeet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blackfeet</a> tribe at the age of six through his friendship with a Blackfoot <a href="medicine_man" title="wikilink">medicine man</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

Hubbard was raised in a townhouse in the center of Helena.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but had one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside Helena.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfoot reservation. The tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he had ever been a Blackfoot blood brother.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1920s the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas. After Hubbard's father Harry rejoined the Navy, his posting aboard the <a href="USS_Oklahoma_(BB-37)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Oklahoma</em></a> in 1921 required the family to relocate to the ship's home ports, first <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a>, then <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> During a journey to <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> in in 1923 Hubbard is said to have received an education in <a href="Freudian_psychology" title="wikilink">Freudian psychology</a> from Commander Joseph &quot;Snake&quot; Thompson, a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and medic.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Scientology biographies describe this encounter as giving Hubbard training in a scientific approach to the mind, which he found unsatisfying.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The following year, Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to <a href="Puget_Sound_Naval_Shipyard_and_Intermediate_Maintenance_Facility" title="wikilink">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a> at <a href="Bremerton,_Washington" title="wikilink">Bremerton, Washington</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> His son was enrolled at Union High School, Bremerton<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and later studied at <a href="Queen_Anne_High_School_(Seattle,_Washington)" title="wikilink">Queen Anne High School</a> in Seattle.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1927 Hubbard's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station on <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a> in the <a href="Mariana_Islands" title="wikilink">Mariana Islands</a> of the South Pacific. Although Hubbard's mother also went to Guam, Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents' care in Helena, Montana to complete his schooling.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1927 and 1929 Hubbard traveled to <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and Guam. Scientology texts present this period in his life as a time when he was intensely curious for answers to human suffering and explored ancient Eastern philosophies for answers, but found them lacking.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He is described as traveling to China &quot;at a time when few Westerners could enter&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and is said to have spent his time questioning Buddhist <a href="lama" title="wikilink">lamas</a> and meeting old Chinese magicians.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> His travels were said to have been funded by his &quot;wealthy grandfather&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard's unofficial biographers present a very different account of his travels in Asia. Hubbard's diaries recorded two trips to the east coast of China. The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927. It consisted of a brief stop-over in a couple of Chinese ports before traveling on to Guam, where he stayed for six weeks before returning home. He recorded his impressions of the places he visited and disdained the poverty of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as &quot;gooks&quot; and &quot;lazy [and] ignorant&quot;. His second visit was a family holiday which took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Bundesarchiv_Bild_137-031735,_Tsingtau,_Teilansicht.jpg" title="fig:Aerial view of Qingdao, China, taken in 1930, two years after Hubbard&#39;s visit" alt="Aerial view of Qingdao, China, taken in 1930, two years after Hubbard&#39;s visit" /> After his return to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard enrolled at <a href="Helena_High_School" title="wikilink">Helena High School</a> but earned only poor grades.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the <a href="United_States_Naval_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Annapolis,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Annapolis, Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>Between October and December 1928 a number of naval families, including Hubbard's, traveled from Guam to China aboard the <em><a href="USS_Gold_Star_(AK-12)" title="wikilink">USS Gold Star</a></em>. The ship stopped at Manila in the Philippines before traveling on to <a href="Qingdao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qingdao</a> (Tsingtao) in China. Hubbard and his parents made a side trip to <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a> before sailing on to <a href="Shanghai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a> and <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, from where they returned to Guam.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Scientology accounts present a different version of events, saying that Hubbard &quot;made his way deep into Manchuria&lt;U+2019&gt;s Western Hills and beyond &lt;U+2013&gt; to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of Kublai Khan.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Hubbard did not record these events in his diary.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He remained unimpressed with China and the Chinese, writing: &quot;A Chinaman can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down.&quot; He characterized the sights of Beijing as &quot;rubberneck stations&quot; for tourists and described the palaces of the <a href="Forbidden_City" title="wikilink">Forbidden City</a> as &quot;very trashy-looking&quot; and &quot;not worth mentioning&quot;. He was impressed by the <a href="Great_Wall_of_China" title="wikilink">Great Wall of China</a> near Beijing<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> but concluded of the Chinese: &quot;They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Back on Guam, Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and failed the Naval Academy entrance examination. In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in <a href="Manassas,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Manassas, Virginia</a> to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to <a href="George_Washington_University" title="wikilink">George Washington University</a>. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="university-and-explorations">University and explorations</h2>
<p><img src="GWU_Professors_Gate.jpg" title="fig:Entrance to Hubbard&#39;s alta mater, George Washington University" alt="Entrance to Hubbard&#39;s alta mater, George Washington University" /> Hubbard studied <a href="civil_engineering" title="wikilink">civil engineering</a> during his two years at George Washington University at the behest of his father, who &quot;decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> His career at George Washington University subsequently became important, as George Malko puts it, because &quot;many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a graduate engineer, but 'a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.'&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, a Church of Scientology biography describes him as &quot;never noted for being in class&quot; and says that he &quot;thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He earned only poor grades, was placed on probation in September 1931 and dropped out altogether in the fall of 1932.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Scientology accounts say that he &quot;studied nuclear physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., before he started his studies about the mind, spirit and life&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and Hubbard himself stated that he &quot;set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> His university records indicate that his exposure to &quot;nuclear physics&quot; consisted of one class in &quot;atomic and molecular phenomena&quot; for which he earned an &quot;F&quot; grade.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>He was far more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and flying. According to Scientology biographies, &quot;he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> One account states that he was &quot;recognized as one of the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s most outstanding pilots. With virtually no training time, he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> His pilot's license, however, records that he only qualified to fly gliders rather than powered aircraft and gave up his license when he could not afford the renewal fee.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>During Hubbard's final semester he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for &quot;fifty young gentleman rovers&quot; aboard the schooner <em>Doris Hamlin</em> commencing in June 1932. The aims of the &quot;Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition&quot; were stated as being to explore and film the pirate &quot;strongholds and bivouacs of the <a href="Spanish_Main" title="wikilink">Spanish Main</a>&quot; and to &quot;collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums&quot;.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> It ran into trouble even before it had left the port of Baltimore: ten participants quit and storms blew the ship far off course to <a href="Bermuda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bermuda</a>. Eleven more members of the expedition quit there and more left when the ship arrived at <a href="Martinique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Martinique</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> With the expedition running critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard blamed the expedition's problems on the captain: &quot;the ship&lt;U+2019&gt;s dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard&lt;U+2019&gt;s hand at both the helm and the charts.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>, the U.S. Hydrographic Office, an unspecified national museum and the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em>,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> though none of those institutions have any record of this.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Hubbard would later write that the expedition &quot;was a crazy idea at best, and I knew it, but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He called it &quot;a two-bit expedition and financial bust,&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Miller, Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico in November 1932 after his father volunteered him for the <a href="American_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">Red Cross</a> relief effort following the devastating <a href="1932_San_Ciprian_hurricane" title="wikilink">1932 San Ciprian hurricane</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> In a 1957 lecture Hubbard said that he had been &quot;a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold. Towards the end of his stay on Puerto Rico he appears to have done some work for a Washington D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated, accompanying a surveyor in an investigation of a small property near the town of <a href="Luquillo,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Luquillo, Puerto Rico</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The survey was unsuccessful.

Scientology texts describe him as becoming &quot;well established as an essayist&quot; even before he had concluded college.

<p>According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was &quot;called to Hollywood&quot; to work on film scripts in the mid-1930s, although Scientology accounts differ as to exactly when this was (whether 1935,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> 1936<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> or 1937<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a>).

<p>Hubbard's authorship in mid-1938 of a still-unpublished manuscript called <em><a href="Excalibur_(L._Ron_Hubbard_work)" title="wikilink">Excalibur</a></em> is highlighted by the Church of Scientology as a key step in developing the principles of Scientology and Dianetics. The manuscript is said to have outlined &quot;the basic principles of human existence&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and to have been the culmination of twenty years of research into &quot;twenty-one races and cultures including Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, Philippine Tagalogs and, as he was wont to joke, the people of the Bronx.&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Arthur J. Cox, a contributor to John W. Campbell's <em>Astounding</em> magazine, Hubbard told a 1948 conference of science fiction fans that <em>Excalibur's</em> inspiration came during an operation in which he &quot;died&quot; for eight minutes.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> (Gerry Armstrong, Hubbard's archivist, explains this as a dental extraction performed under <a href="nitrous_oxide" title="wikilink">nitrous oxide</a>, a chemical known for its hallucinogenic effects<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a>):</p>

<p><a href="Arthur_J._Burks" title="wikilink">Arthur J. Burks</a>, the President of the American Fiction Guild, wrote that an excited Hubbard called him and said: &quot;I want to see you right away. I have written THE book.&quot; Hubbard believed that <em>Excalibur</em> would &quot;revolutionize everything&quot; and that &quot;it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, &quot;the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology.&quot;<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Burks, Hubbard &quot;was so sure he had something 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written &quot;THE book&quot; and that they were to meet him at <a href="Pennsylvania_Station_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">Penn Station</a>, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer.&quot; However, nobody bought the manuscript.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> <a href="Forrest_J_Ackerman" title="wikilink">Forrest J Ackerman</a> , later Hubbard's <a href="literary_agent" title="wikilink">literary agent</a>, recalled that Hubbard told him &quot;whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window.&quot;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Hubbard's failure to sell <em>Excalibur</em> depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: &quot;Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position.&quot;<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> He went on:</p>

Moulton in Portland, Oregon in 1943" /> After returning from Alaska, Hubbard applied to join the United States Navy. His Congressman <a href="Warren_G._Magnuson" title="wikilink">Warren G. Magnuson</a> wrote to President Roosevelt to recommend Hubbard as &quot;a gentleman of reputation&quot; who was &quot;a respected explorer&quot; and had &quot;marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States&quot;. Hubbard was described as &quot;a key figure&quot; in writing organizations, &quot;making him politically potent nationally&quot;. The Congressman concluded: &quot;Anything you can do for Mr Hubbard will be appreciated.&quot; His friend Robert MacDonald Ford, by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as &quot;one of the most brilliant men I have ever known&quot;. Hubbard was said to be &quot;a powerful influence&quot; in the Northwest and to be &quot;well known in many parts of the world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska.&quot; The letter declared that &quot;for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him.&quot; Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: &quot;I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. I just gave him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'&quot;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The Church of Scientology presents him as a &quot;much-decorated war hero who commanded a <a href="corvette" class="uri" title="wikilink">corvette</a> and during hostilities was crippled and wounded.&quot;<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Scientology publications say he served as a &quot;Commodore of Corvette squadrons&quot; in &quot;all five theaters of World War II&quot; and was awarded &quot;twenty-one medals and palms&quot; for his service.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> He was &quot;severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded&quot; to a military hospital, where he &quot;worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe.&quot;<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> He claimed to have seen combat repeatedly, telling A. E. van Vogt that he had once sailed his ship &quot;right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>. His attitude was that if you took your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days.&quot;<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>However, his official Navy service records indicate that &quot;his military performance was, at times, substandard&quot; and he received only four campaign medals rather than twenty-one. He was never recorded as being injured or wounded in combat and so never received a <a href="Purple_Heart" title="wikilink">Purple Heart</a>.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Most of his military service was spent ashore in the <a href="continental_United_States" title="wikilink">continental United States</a> on administrative or training duties. He served for a short time in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> but was sent home after quarreling with his superiors. He briefly commanded two <a href="Anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine vessels</a>, the <a href="USS_YP-422" title="wikilink">USS <em>YP-422</em></a> and <a href="USS_PC-815" title="wikilink">USS <em>PC-815</em></a>, in coastal waters off <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> and <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> in 1942 and 1943 respectively.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>After Hubbard reported that the <em>PC-815</em> had attacked and crippled or sunk two <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy_submarines" title="wikilink">Japanese submarines</a> off Oregon in May 1943, his claim was rejected by the commander of the <a href="Northwest_Sea_Frontier" title="wikilink">Northwest Sea Frontier</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Hubbard and Thomas Moulton, his second in command on the <em>PC-815</em>, later said the Navy wanted to avoid panic on the mainland.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> A month later Hubbard unwittingly sailed the <em>PC-815</em> into Mexican territorial waters and conducted gunnery practice off the <a href="Coronado_Islands" title="wikilink">Coronado Islands</a>, in the belief that they were uninhabited and belonged to the United States. The Mexican government complained and Hubbard was relieved of command. A fitness report written after the incident rated Hubbard as unsuitable for independent duties and &quot;lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation.&quot;<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> He served for a while as the Navigation and Training Officer for the <a href="USS_Algol_(AKA-54)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Algol</em></a> while it was based at Portland.

According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either &quot;by the flash of a large-caliber gun&quot; or when he had &quot;a bomb go off in my face&quot;.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Scientology texts say that he returned from the war &quot;[b]linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back&quot; and was twice pronounced dead.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>His medical records state that he was hospitalized with an acute <a href="duodenal_ulcer" title="wikilink">duodenal ulcer</a> rather than a war injury. He told his doctors that he was suffering from lameness caused by a hip infection<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> and he told <em>Look</em> magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from &quot;ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, bursitis and something wrong with my feet.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him &quot;continuous trouble&quot; for eight years, especially when &quot;under nervous stress.&quot; This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide &quot;a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems.&quot;<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>The Church of Scientology says that Hubbard's key breakthrough in the development of Dianetics was made at <a href="Oak_Knoll_Naval_Hospital" title="wikilink">Oak Knoll Naval Hospital</a> in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>. According to the Church,</p>

<p>An October 1945 Naval Board found that Hubbard was &quot;considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> He was discharged from hospital on December 4, 1945 and transferred to inactive duty on February 17, 1946. He resigned his commission with effect from October 30, 1950.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The Church of Scientology says he quit because the U.S. Navy &quot;attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project &quot;to make man more suggestible&quot; and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function. Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The Navy said in a statement in 1980: &quot;There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty.&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>The Church disputes the official record of Hubbard's naval career. It asserts that the records are incomplete and perhaps falsified &quot;to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> In 1990 the Church provided the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> with a document that was said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service.

<p>Hubbard's life underwent a turbulent period immediately after the war.

Hubbard had a different idea; he wrote to the U.S. Navy requesting permission to leave the country &quot;to visit Central &amp; South America &amp; China&quot; for the purposes of &quot;collecting writing material&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; in other words, undertaking a world cruise.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Aleister Crowley strongly criticized Parsons's actions: &quot;Suspect Ron playing confidence trick &lt;U+2013&gt; Jack Parsons weak fool &lt;U+2013&gt; obvious victim prowling swindlers.&quot; Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> They attempted to sail anyway but were forced back to port by a storm.

<p>Hubbard's fellow writers were well aware of what had happened between him and Parsons. L. Sprague de Camp wrote to Isaac Asimov on August 27, 1946 to tell him:</p>

<p>Scientology accounts do not mention Hubbard's involvement in occultism.

<p>The Church of Scientology says Hubbard was &quot;sent in&quot; by his fellow science fiction author Robert Heinlein, &quot;who was running off-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time.&quot; However, Heinlein's authorized biographer has said that he looked into the matter at the suggestion of Scientologists but found nothing to corroborate claims that Heinlein had been involved, and his biography of Heinlein makes no mention of the matter.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 10, 1946, Hubbard <a href="bigamy" title="wikilink">bigamously</a> married Sara, even though he was still married to Polly.

Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups had been set up across the United States.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<p>Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> The <a href="American_Psychological_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychological Association</a> criticized Hubbard's claims as &quot;not supported by empirical evidence&quot;.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> <em><a href="Scientific_American" title="wikilink">Scientific American</a></em> said that Hubbard's book contained &quot;more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing&quot;,<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> while <em><a href="The_New_Republic" title="wikilink">The New Republic</a></em> called it a &quot;bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology&quot;.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; Isaac Asimov considered it &quot;gibberish&quot;<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> while <a href="Jack_Williamson" title="wikilink">Jack Williamson</a> called it &quot;a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<p>Several famous individuals became involved with Dianetics. <a href="Aldous_Huxley" title="wikilink">Aldous Huxley</a> received auditing from Hubbard himself,<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> the poet <a href="Jean_Toomer" title="wikilink">Jean Toomer</a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> and the science fiction writers <a href="Theodore_Sturgeon" title="wikilink">Theodore Sturgeon</a><a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> and A. E. van Vogt became trained Dianetics auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became the head of the newly-established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago and Honolulu.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Dianetics was not cheap, a great many people were nonetheless willing to pay; van Vogt later recalled &quot;doing little but tear open envelopes and pull out $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor's course.&quot;<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 (equivalent to $0.5 million at 2010 prices) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation the books showed that &quot;a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for.&quot;<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard played a very active role in the Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and training auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said: &quot;He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how at a dinner party he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives &quot;all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs.&quot;<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> As Atack comments, he was &quot;a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him.&quot;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> <a href="Christopher_Evans_(computer_scientist)" title="wikilink">Christopher Evans</a> described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology:</p>

<p>Hubbard's supporters soon began to have doubts about Dianetics. Winter became disillusioned and wrote that he had never seen a single convincing Clear: &quot;I have seen some individuals who are supposed to have been 'clear,' but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state. Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis.&quot;<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the <a href="Shrine_Auditorium" title="wikilink">Shrine Auditorium</a> in Los Angeles failed disastrously.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, &quot;in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left.&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard also faced other practitioners moving into leadership positions within the Dianetics community. It was structured as an open, public practice in which others were free to pursue their own lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard's.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard's ideas with a wide variety of <a href="Esotericism" title="wikilink">esoteric</a> and even occult practices.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> By late 1950, the Elizabeth, N.J.

<p>The collapse of Hubbard's marriage to Sara created yet more problems. He had begun an affair with his 20-year-old public relations assistant in late 1950, while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> in March 1951, portraying them in a letter as <a href="Communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communist</a> infiltrators. According to Hubbard, Sara was &quot;currently intimate with [Communists] but evidently under coercion. Drug addiction set in fall 1950. Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago.&quot; Hollister was described as having a &quot;sharp chin, broad forehead, rather Slavic&quot;. He was said to be the &quot;center of most turbulence in our organization&quot; and &quot;active and dangerous&quot;.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously and annotated his correspondence with the comment: &quot;Appears mental&quot;.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Three weeks later, Hubbard and two Foundation staff seized Sara and his year-old daughter Alexis and forcibly took them to <a href="San_Bernardino,_California" title="wikilink">San Bernardino, California</a>, where he attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> He let Sara go but took Alexis to <a href="Havana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Havana</a>, <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>.

<p>Dianetics appeared to be on the edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in <a href="Wichita,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Wichita, Kansas</a>. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> The Wichita Foundation became financially unviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J.

<p>Only six weeks after setting up the Hubbard College and marrying a staff member, 18-year-old Mary Sue Whipp, Hubbard closed it down and moved with his new bride to <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix, Arizona</a>.

Ron Hubbard House museum." /> The Church of Scientology attributes its genesis to Hubbard's discovery of &quot;a new line of research&quot;, first set out in his book <em>Science of Survival</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;that man is most fundamentally a spiritual being&quot;.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Non-Scientologist writers have suggested alternative motives: that he aimed &quot;to reassert control over his creation&quot;,<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> that he believed &quot;he was about to lose control of Dianetics&quot;,<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> or that he wanted to ensure &quot;he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to ... the hated Don Purcell.&quot;<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard expanded upon the basics of Dianetics to construct a spiritually-oriented (though at this stage not religious) doctrine based on the concept that the true self of a person was a <a href="thetan" class="uri" title="wikilink">thetan</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; an immortal, omniscient and potentially omnipotent entity.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> Hubbard taught that the thetans, having created the material universe, had forgotten their god-like powers and become trapped in physical bodies.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Scientology aimed to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; each person's thetan to restore its original capacities and become once again an &quot;<a href="Operating_Thetan" title="wikilink">Operating Thetan</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a><a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by the forces of &quot;aberration&quot;, which were the result of engrams carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard introduced a device called an <a href="E-meter" class="uri" title="wikilink">E-meter</a> that he presented as having, as Miller puts it, &quot;an almost mystical power to reveal an individual's innermost thoughts.&quot;<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> He promulgated Scientology through a series of lectures, bulletins and books such as <em><a href="Scientology:_A_History_of_Man" title="wikilink">A History of Man</a></em> (&quot;a cold-blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years&quot;)<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> and <em>Scientology: 8-8008</em> (&quot;With this book, the ability to make one's body old or young at will, the ability to heal the ill without physical contact, the ability to cure the insane and the incapacitated, is set forth for the physician, the layman, the mathematician and the physicist.&quot;)<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>Scientology was organized in a very different way to the decentralized Dianetics movement. The Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS) was the only official Scientology organization. Training procedures and doctrines were standardized and promoted through HAS publications, and administrators and auditors were not permitted to deviate from Hubbard's approach.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Branches or &quot;orgs&quot; were organized as franchises, rather like a <a href="fast_food_restaurant" title="wikilink">fast food restaurant</a> chain. Each franchise holder was required to pay ten per cent of income to Hubbard's central organization. They were expected to find new recruits, known as &quot;raw meat&quot;, but were restricted to providing only basic services. Costlier higher-level auditing was only provided by Hubbard's central organization.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>Although this model would eventually be extremely successful, Scientology was a very small-scale movement at first. Hubbard started off with only a few dozen followers, generally dedicated Dianeticists; a seventy-hour series of lectures in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> Hubbard also traveled to the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> to establish his control over a Dianetics group in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. It was very much a shoestring operation; as Helen O'Brien later recalled, &quot;there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all. At 163 <a href="Holland_Park_Avenue" title="wikilink">Holland Park Avenue</a> was an ill-lit lecture room and a bare-boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet &lt;U+2013&gt; mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women.&quot;<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> On September 24, 1952, only a few weeks after arriving in London, Hubbard's wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1953, Hubbard acquired a doctorate from <a href="Sequoia_University" title="wikilink">Sequoia University</a>. According to a Scientology biography, this was &quot;given in recognition of his outstanding work on Dianetics&quot; and &quot;as an inspiration to the many people ... who had been inspired by him to take up advanced studies in this field...&quot;&quot;<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> The British government concluded in the 1970s that Sequoia University was a &quot;<a href="degree_mill" title="wikilink">degree mill</a>&quot; operated by Joseph Hough, a Los Angeles chiropractor.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Miller cites a telegram sent by Hubbard on February 27, 1953 in which he instructed Scientologist Richard de Mille to procure him a Ph.D from Hough urgently &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;FOR GOSH SAKES EXPEDITE.

<h2 id="controversies-and-crisis">Controversies and crisis</h2>
<p>By the start of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a worldwide movement with thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy.</p>
<p>The Church of Scientology says that the problems of this period were due to &quot;vicious, covert international attacks&quot; by the United States government, &quot;all of which were proven false and baseless, which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750 million dollars for conspiracy.&quot;<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> Behind the attacks, claimed Hubbard, lay a vast conspiracy of &quot;psychiatric front groups&quot; secretly controlling governments: &quot;Every single lie, false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group&lt;U+2019&gt;s members. They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind. They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field.&quot;<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard believed that Scientology was being infiltrated by saboteurs and spies and introduced &quot;<a href="List_of_Scientology_Security_Checks" title="wikilink">security checking</a>&quot;<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> to identify those he termed &quot;potential trouble sources&quot; and &quot;<a href="suppressive_person" title="wikilink">suppressive persons</a>&quot;. Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E-meters and were asked questions such as &quot;Have you ever practiced homosexuality?&quot; and &quot;Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?&quot;<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> For a time, Scientologists were even interrogated about crimes committed in past lives: &quot;Have you ever destroyed a culture?&quot; &quot;Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?&quot; &quot;Have you ever zapped anyone?&quot;<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
<p>He also sought to exert political influence, advising Scientologists to vote against <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> in the <a href="1960_United_States_presidential_election" title="wikilink">1960 presidential election</a> and establishing a Department of Government Affairs &quot;to bring government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology.&quot; This, he said, &quot;is done by high-level ability to control and in its absence by a low-level ability to overwhelm. Introvert such agencies. Control such agencies.&quot;<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>
<p>The U.S. Government was already well aware of Hubbard's activities.

<p>Following the FDA's actions, Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English-speaking world.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria, Australia</a>, where it was accused of <a href="brainwashing" class="uri" title="wikilink">brainwashing</a>, blackmail, extortion and damaging the mental health of its members.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> <a href="Anderson_Report" title="wikilink">Its report</a>, published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself.

Newspapers and politicians in the U.K. pressed the British government for action against Scientology. In July 1968, the British <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Health" title="wikilink">Minister of Health</a>, <a href="Kenneth_Robinson" title="wikilink">Kenneth Robinson</a>, announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the U.K. and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an &quot;undesirable alien.&quot;<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> Further inquiries were launched in <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> and <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard took three major new initiatives in the face of these challenges. &quot;Ethics Technology&quot; was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to &quot;<a href="Disconnection" title="wikilink">disconnect</a>&quot; from any organization or individual &lt;U+2013&gt; including family members &lt;U+2013&gt; deemed to be disruptive or &quot;suppressive&quot;.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> Scientologists were also required to write &quot;Knowledge Reports&quot; on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable &quot;Misdemenors,&quot; &quot;Crimes&quot; and &quot;High Crimes&quot;.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> The &quot;<a href="Fair_Game_(Scientology)" title="wikilink">Fair Game</a>&quot; policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an &quot;enemy&quot; of Scientology: &quot;May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist.

<p>At the start of March 1966, Hubbard created the <a href="Guardian&#39;s_Office" title="wikilink">Guardian's Office</a> (GO), a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> It dealt with Scientology's external affairs, including public relations, legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention, the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander; it issued more than forty on a single day.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> Hubbard ordered his staff to find &quot;lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence [<em>sic</em>] on [Scientology's] attackers.&quot;<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, at the end of 1966, Hubbard acquired his own fleet of ships.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> He established the &quot;Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd&quot; which purchased three ships &lt;U+2013&gt; the <em>Enchanter</em>, a forty-ton schooner,<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> the <em>Avon River</em>, an old trawler,<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a> and the <em>Royal Scotman</em> [<em>sic</em>], a former <a href="Irish_Sea" title="wikilink">Irish Sea</a> cattle ferry that he made his home and flagship.<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a> The ships were crewed by the Sea Organization or &quot;<a href="Sea_Org" title="wikilink">Sea Org</a>,&quot; a group of Scientologist volunteers, with the support of a couple of professional seamen.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a><a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a></p>

The fleet traveled as far as <a href="Corfu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corfu</a> in the eastern Mediterranean and <a href="Dakar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dakar</a> and the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> in the Atlantic, but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks. Ken Urquhart, Hubbard's personal assistant at the time, later recalled:</p>

<p>When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily telex messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and <a href="Liechtenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liechtenstein</a>.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a> Couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a></p>

French prosecutors charged him and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations in 1972. He was advised that he was at risk of being extradited to France.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a> Hubbard left the Sea Org fleet temporarily at the end of 1972, living incognito in <a href="Queens,_New_York" title="wikilink">Queens, New York</a><a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> until he returned to his flagship in September 1973 when the threat of extradition had abated.<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> Scientology sources say that he carried out &quot;a sociological study in and around New York City.&quot;<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard's health deteriorated significantly during this period.

<p>Throughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian's Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency that he had established in 1966. He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international Nazi conspiracy, which he termed the &quot;Tenyaka Memorial&quot;, through a network of drug companies, banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> In 1973 he instigated the &quot;Snow White Program&quot; and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a> The GO was ordered to &quot;get all false and secret files on Scientology, LRH ... that cannot be obtained legally, by all possible lines of approach ... i.e., job penetration, janitor penetration, suitable guises utilizing covers.&quot; His involvement in the GO's operations was concealed through the use of codenames. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as <a href="List_of_Guardian&#39;s_Office_operations#Operation_Bulldozer_Leak" title="wikilink">Operation Bulldozer Leak</a>, intended &quot;to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual [Suppressive Persons] to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity.&quot; He was kept informed of GO operations, such as the theft of medical records from a hospital, attacks on psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various time, such as the <a href="Better_Business_Bureau" title="wikilink">Better Business Bureau</a>, the <a href="American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">American Medical Association</a>, and <a href="American_Psychiatric_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychiatric Association</a>.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a></p>
<p>Members of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> After two GO agents were caught in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the IRS, the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on GO offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1977. They retrieved wiretap equipment, burglary tools and some 90,000 pages of incriminating documents. Hubbard was not prosecuted, though he was labeled an &quot;<a href="unindicted_co-conspirator" title="wikilink">unindicted co-conspirator</a>&quot; by government prosecutors. His wife Mary Sue was indicted and subsequently convicted of <a href="conspiracy_(crime)" title="wikilink">conspiracy</a>. She was sent to a federal prison along with ten other Scientologists.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard's troubles increased in February 1978 when a French court convicted him in absentia for obtaining money under false pretenses. He was sentenced to four years in prison and a 35,000<a href="French_franc" title="wikilink">F</a> ($7,000) fine.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> He went into hiding in April 1979, moving to an apartment in <a href="Hemet,_California" title="wikilink">Hemet, California</a> where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a> Hubbard faced a possible indictment for his role in <a href="Operation_Freakout" title="wikilink">Operation Freakout</a>, the GO's campaign against New York journalist <a href="Paulette_Cooper" title="wikilink">Paulette Cooper</a>, and in February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a><a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a></p>
<p>For the first few years of the 1980s, Hubbard and the Broekers lived on the move, touring the Pacific Northwest in a <a href="recreational_vehicle" title="wikilink">recreational vehicle</a> and living for a while in apartments in <a href="Newport_Beach" title="wikilink">Newport Beach</a> and Los Angeles.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> Hubbard used his time in hiding to write his first new works of science fiction for nearly thirty years &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="Battlefield_Earth_(novel)" title="wikilink">Battlefield Earth</a></em> (1982) and <em><a href="Mission_Earth_(novel)" title="wikilink">Mission Earth</a></em>, a ten-volume series published between 1985 and 1987.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a> They received mixed responses; as writer Jeff Walker puts it, they were &quot;treated derisively by most critics but greatly admired by followers.&quot;<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> Hubbard also wrote and composed music for three of his albums, which were produced by the Church of Scientology.

<p>In Hubbard's absence, members of the Sea Org staged a takeover of the Church of Scientology and purged many veteran Scientologists. A young Messenger, <a href="David_Miscavige" title="wikilink">David Miscavige</a>, became Scientology's <em>de facto</em> leader. Mary Sue Hubbard was forced to resign her position and her daughter Suzette became Miscavige's personal maid.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Church_of_Spiritual_Technology_ranch_Creston.jpg" title="fig:The ranch in San Luis Obispo County, California where Hubbard spent his final years" alt="The ranch in San Luis Obispo County, California where Hubbard spent his final years" /> For the last two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury <a href="Blue_Bird_Corporation" title="wikilink">Blue Bird</a> motorhome on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near <a href="Creston,_California" title="wikilink">Creston, California</a>. He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so, where. According to a spokesperson, he spent his time &quot;writing and researching&quot;, pursuing photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a> He repeatedly redesigned the property, spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house &lt;U+2013&gt; which went virtually uninhabited &lt;U+2013&gt; and building a quarter-mile horse-racing track with an observation tower, which reportedly was never used.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a></p>
<p>He was still closely involved in managing the Church of Scientology via secretly delivered orders<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> and continued to receive large amounts of money, of which <em>Forbes</em> magazine estimated &quot;at least $200 million gathered in Hubbard's name through 1982&quot;. In September 1985, the IRS notified the Church that it was considering indicting Hubbard for tax fraud.<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a></p>
<p>Hubbard suffered further ill-health, including chronic <a href="pancreatitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">pancreatitis</a>, during his residence at Whispering Winds.

<p>Hubbard was survived by his wife Mary Sue and all of his children except his second son Quentin. His will provided a trust fund to support Mary Sue; her children Arthur, Diana and Suzette; and Katherine, the daughter of his first wife Polly.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a> He disinherited two of his other children.<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"><sup>371</sup></a> L.

<p>The copyrights of his works and much of his estate and wealth were willed to the Church of Scientology.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376"><sup>376</sup></a> In a bulletin dated May 5, 1980, Hubbard told his followers to preserve his teachings until an eventual reincarnation when he would return &quot;not as a religious leader but as a political one&quot;.<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377"><sup>377</sup></a> The <a href="Church_of_Spiritual_Technology" title="wikilink">Church of Spiritual Technology</a> (CST), a sister organization of the Church of Scientology, has engraved Hubbard's entire corpus of Scientology and Dianetics texts on steel tablets stored in titanium containers.

<p>Hubbard is the <a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Record</a> holder for the most published author, with 1,084 works,<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379"><sup>379</sup></a> most translated book (70 languages for <em><a href="The_Way_to_Happiness" title="wikilink">The Way to Happiness</a></em>)<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"><sup>380</sup></a> and most audiobooks (185 as of April 2009).<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"><sup>381</sup></a> According to Galaxy Press, Hubbard's <em>Battlefield Earth</em> has sold over 6 million copies and <em>Mission Earth</em> a further 7 million, with each of its ten volumes becoming <a href="The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list" title="wikilink"><em>New York Times</em> bestsellers</a> on their release.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382"><sup>382</sup></a> However, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported in 1990 that Hubbard's followers had been buying large numbers of the books and re-issuing them to stores to boost sales.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"><sup>383</sup></a> Opinions are divided about his literary legacy. Scientologists have written of their desire to &quot;make Ron the most acclaimed and widely known author of all time&quot;.<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384"><sup>384</sup></a> The sociologist <a href="William_Sims_Bainbridge" title="wikilink">William Sims Bainbridge</a> writes that even at his peak in the late 1930s Hubbard was regarded by readers of <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em> as merely &quot;a passable, familiar author but not one of the best&quot;, while by the late 1970s &quot;the [science fiction] subculture wishes it could forget him&quot; and fans gave him a worse rating than any other of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; writers.<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"><sup>385</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, eighteen years after Hubbard's death, the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide. According to religious scholar <a href="J._Gordon_Melton" title="wikilink">J.

Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a desk, chair and writing equipment, ready to be used.<a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388"><sup>388</sup></a> <a href="Lonnie_D._Kliever" title="wikilink">Lonnie D. Kliever</a> notes that Hubbard was &quot;the only source of the religion, and he has no successor&quot;.

<p>The Danish historian of religions Mikael Rothstein describes Scientology as &quot;a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard.&quot; He comments: &quot;The fact that [Hubbard's] life is mythologized is as obvious as in the cases of <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>, <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> or Siddartha Gotama. This is how religion works. Scientology, however, rejects this analysis altogether, and goes to great lengths to defend every detail of Hubbard's amazing and fantastic life as plain historical fact.&quot; Hubbard is presented as &quot;the master of a multitude of disciplines&quot; who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor.<a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref391"><sup>391</sup></a> The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard's life and work as having proceeded seamlessly, &quot;as if they were a continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research&quot; even up to and beyond his death.<a href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"><sup>392</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Rothstein's assessment of Hubbard's legacy, Scientology consciously aims to transfer the <a href="charismatic_authority" title="wikilink">charismatic authority</a> of Hubbard to institutionalize his authority over the organization, even after his death. Hubbard is presented as a virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history.<a href="#fn393" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393"><sup>393</sup></a> As Rothstein puts it, &quot;reverence for Scientology's scripture is reverence for Hubbard, the man who in the Scientological perspective single-handedly brought salvation to all human beings.&quot;<a href="#fn394" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref394"><sup>394</sup></a> <a href="David_G._Bromley" title="wikilink">David G.

<p>Following Hubbard's death, <a href="Bridge_Publications_(Scientology)" title="wikilink">Bridge Publications</a> has published several stand-alone biographical accounts of his life, notably <em>The Ron Series</em>, dedicated to various aspects of Hubbard's life and work. Marco Frenschkowski notes that &quot;non-Scientologist readers immediately recognize some parts of Hubbard's life are here systematically left out: no information whatsoever is given about his private life (his marriages, divorces, children), his legal affairs and so on.&quot;<a href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"><sup>399</sup></a> The Church maintains an extensive website presenting the official version of Hubbard's life.<a href="#fn400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"><sup>400</sup></a> It also owns a number of properties dedicated to Hubbard including the Los Angeles-based L.

<p>In the late 1970s two men began to assemble a very different picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over the next four years he collected previously undisclosed records and documents on Hubbard's life. He intended to write an expos&lt;U+00E9&gt; of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts, but was unable to find a publisher.<a href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"><sup>402</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon's findings were acquired by Gerry Armstrong, a Scientologist who had been appointed Hubbard's official archivist.<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403"><sup>403</sup></a> He had been given the job of assembling documents relating to Hubbard's life for the purpose of helping Omar V. Garrison, a non-Scientologist who had written two books sympathetic to Scientology, to write an official biography. However, the documents that he uncovered convinced both Armstrong and Garrison that Hubbard had systematically misrepresented his life. Garrison refused to write a &quot;puff piece&quot; and declared that he would not &quot;repeat all the falsehoods they [the Church of Scientology] had perpetuated over the years.&quot; He wrote a &quot;warts and all&quot; biography while Armstrong quit Scientology, taking five boxes of papers with him. The Church of Scientology and Mary Sue Hubbard sued for the return of the documents while settling out of court with Garrison, requiring him to turn over the nearly-completed manuscript of the biography.<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a> In October 1984 Judge Paul G.
