<p><strong>Hurricane Inez</strong> was a late-season <a href="tropical_cyclone_scales" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a>{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of at least 111 mph (179 km/h), or a Category 3 or higher on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} that affected the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a>, <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, and <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, the first such storm on record to affect those areas. It originated from a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> over Africa, and became a tropical depression by September 21. It moved slowly westward, initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Inez on September 24. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French <a href="overseas_region" title="wikilink">overseas region</a> of <a href="Guadeloupe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadeloupe</a> on September 27. Inez severely damaged the island's banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000 people homeless. Damage on Guadeloupe was estimated at $50 million,{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1955 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">United States dollars</a> unless otherwise noted.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} and there were 40 deaths. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before restrengthening, attaining peak <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">sustained winds</a> of  on September 28. That day, a <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight reported a gust of , which was the highest recorded at the time.</p>
<p>Continuing westward, Inez made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> as a small hurricane on the <a href="Barahona_Province" title="wikilink">Barahona Peninsula</a> of the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a>. There, the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800 houses. Nationwide, there were about 100 deaths and $12 million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000 people were killed, and 60,000 people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35 million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September 30. There, 125,000 people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20 million in damage.</p>
<p>The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5 million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160 homes and 190 trailers were damaged. <a href="Sea_spray" title="wikilink">Salt spray</a> damaged crops in the region, and there was $5 million in damage and four deaths. In the <a href="Straits_of_Florida" title="wikilink">Straits of Florida</a>, Inez capsized a boat of <a href="Cuban_exile" title="wikilink">Cuban refugees</a>, killing 45 people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11 people. The hurricane threatened the northern <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a>, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of <a href="Tamaulipas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tamaulipas</a> and cut off roads to <a href="Tampico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tampico</a>. 84,000 people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500 houses. Damage was estimated at $104 million, and there were 74 deaths in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The origins of Inez were from a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> that formed over the <a href="Sahara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sahara</a> in central Africa on September 15 from the <a href="monsoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">monsoon</a>. It moved westward in the <a href="prevailing_winds" title="wikilink">prevailing winds</a>, exiting the west coast of Africa on September 18. The precursor to Inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> which was considered a tropical depression in the annual tropical cyclone summary on September 18. Tracked by satellites, the system moved to the west-southwest,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and was officially classified a tropical depression on September 21 about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. The system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest. A <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight indicated some intensification in the system, prompting the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Inez, located about  east of <a href="Martinique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Martinique</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> With warm water temperatures, the storm developed a circular area of <a href="convection_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">convection</a> over the center.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Inez slowed while curving to the west due to a <a href="subtropical_ridge" title="wikilink">ridge</a> to the north and quickly intensified,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> reaching hurricane status on September 26.</p>
<p>On September 27, Inez intensified to reach winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), making it a Category 3 on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson scale</a>. Later that day, the hurricane moved directly over <a href="Guadeloupe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadeloupe</a>. At the time, Inez was a small cyclone, with hurricane-force winds extending  from the center.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Subsequent meteorologists labeled the storm as a &quot;micro-hurricane... because of its characteristic small, tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Its structure became disrupted by the island, and the <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> rose from  to , indicative of weakening. However, Inez re-intensified after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, reaching a minimum pressure of  on September 28 while south of <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>. The Hurricane Hunters reported <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">sustained winds</a> of  at a height of , which was the highest recorded at the time. The same flight estimated surface winds between  near the center.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The peak intensity listed in the <a href="HURDAT" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane database</a> is , making Inez a strong <a href="List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes" title="wikilink">Category 4</a> hurricane.</p>
<p><img src="Hurricane_Inez_in_GOM.png" title="fig:Hurricane Inez near Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula" alt="Hurricane Inez near Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula" /> While near peak intensity, Inez was located about  southwest of <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>, and the <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> was tracked by radar from the island. Its increasing <a href="outflow_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">outflow</a> caused <a href="1966_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Tropical_Storm_Judith" title="wikilink">Tropical Storm Judith</a> to the east to dissipate. On September 29, the small but powerful hurricane made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on the <a href="Barahona_Province" title="wikilink">Barahona Peninsula</a>, and quickly weakened over land. It briefly moved offshore and struck the <a href="Tiburon_Peninsula,_Haiti" title="wikilink">southern peninsula</a> of <a href="Haiti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haiti</a> near <a href="Jacmel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jacmel</a>. The eye emerged into the <a href="Windward_Passage" title="wikilink">Windward Passage</a> near <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;og&lt;U+00E2&gt;ne" class="uri" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;og&lt;U+00E2&gt;ne</a>, although severely weakened; the pressure rose to ,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the winds decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h) over land. However, Inez quickly re-intensified over water, reaching winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on September 30 before striking southeastern Cuba near <a href="Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo_Bay" title="wikilink">Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay</a>. When Inez was over Cuba, forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm's future, and due to a weakness in the ridge to the north, it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the United States. The hurricane drifted to the west-northwest due to weak steering currents, weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of Cuba. While over water, the eye reorganized, and the storm maintained hurricane intensity. Inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central Cuba and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October 2.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after exiting Cuba into the Atlantic, Inez weakened into a tropical storm, and was moving northeastward through the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a> about 24 hours later than forecast.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At the time, the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the <a href="Bermuda_high" title="wikilink">Bermuda high</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> With little outflow and a large, diffuse circulation, Inez did not re-intensify much despite otherwise favorable conditions,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> potentially due to a nearby <a href="trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The movement slowed, and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that &quot;Inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the United States mainland than any other storm.&quot; On October 3, Inez turned to the west-southwest due to a strengthening ridge over the western Gulf of Mexico. Over the subsequent few days, the eye moved directly over the <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Florida Keys</a> from <a href="Key_Largo,_Florida" title="wikilink">Key Largo</a> to <a href="Key_West,_Florida" title="wikilink">Key West</a> and continued through the Gulf of Mexico while slowly intensifying. On October 7, Inez brushed the northern coast of the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a> with hurricane force winds. Subsequently, the ridge weakened, allowing the hurricane to turn more to the west-northwest.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On October 8, Inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140 mph (220 km/h), and a pressure of . Briefly threatening the coastline of Texas, Inez turned turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened. On October 10, the hurricane made its final landfall near <a href="Tampico,_Tamaulipas" title="wikilink">Tampico, Tamaulipas</a> in northeastern Mexico. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating on October 11.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The unusual track of Inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser</a> and <a href="Greater_Antilles" title="wikilink">Greater Antilles</a>, <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, and <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> described Inez as the &quot;first to strike the Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula in many years.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> It was also the first to move across the Gulf of Mexico without turning to the north so late in the season, and the 65 advisories issued by the NHC was the highest at the time. The path taken by Inez was compared to <a href="Hurricane_Betsy" title="wikilink">Hurricane Betsy</a> in 1965, which also slowed and moved erratically due to a ridge.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane due to the unusual path, as well as the inability to fly the Hurricane Hunters into Inez while it was over Cuba.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>In Guadeloupe, which was the first area the hurricane affected, residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters. <a href="Pan_American_World_Airways" title="wikilink">Pan American World Airways</a> canceled flights to the region.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When Inez was near peak intensity, the NHC warned residents in southern Dominican Republic and Haiti of the danger posed by the hurricane. The agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track. In general, <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">hurricane warnings</a> were issued 24 hours in advance, with the exception of southeastern Florida due to the hurricane's slowing track.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Overall, 250,000 people evacuated along the path of Inez.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> At Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay, officials ordered residents at the <a href="Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base" title="wikilink">naval base</a> to evacuate to storm shelters.
