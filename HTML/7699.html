<p>The <strong>M4 carbine</strong> is a family of firearms tracing its lineage back to earlier <a href="carbine" class="uri" title="wikilink">carbine</a> versions of the <a href="M16_rifle" title="wikilink">M16</a>, all based on the original <a href="AR-15" class="uri" title="wikilink">AR-15</a> designed by <a href="Eugene_Stoner" title="wikilink">Eugene Stoner</a> and made by <a href="ArmaLite" class="uri" title="wikilink">ArmaLite</a>. It is a shorter and lighter version of the <a href="M16_rifle#M16A2" title="wikilink">M16A2</a> <a href="assault_rifle" title="wikilink">assault rifle</a>, with 80% parts commonality.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <strong>M4</strong> has <a href="selective_fire" title="wikilink">selective fire</a> options including <a href="Semi-automatic_firearm" title="wikilink">semi-automatic</a> and <a href="Burst_mode_(firearm)" title="wikilink">three-round burst</a> (like the M16A2), while the <strong>M4A1</strong> has a &quot;<a href="Automatic_firearm" title="wikilink">full auto</a>&quot; option instead of three-round burst.</p>

<p>The M4 and its variants fire <a href="5.56x45mm_NATO" title="wikilink">5.56x45mm NATO</a> <a href="ammunition" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammunition</a> (or <a href=".223_Remington" title="wikilink">.223 Remington</a> ammunition) and are <a href="gas-operated" class="uri" title="wikilink">gas-operated</a>, air-cooled, <a href="Magazine_(firearm)" title="wikilink">magazine</a>-fed, selective fire <a href="firearms" class="uri" title="wikilink">firearms</a> with a multi-position <a href="telescoping_stock" title="wikilink">telescoping stock</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Original M4 models had a flat-ended telescoping <a href="Stock_(firearm)" title="wikilink">stock</a>, but newer models are now equipped with a redesigned telescoping stock that is slightly larger with curvature at the end. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The M4 is similar to much earlier compact M16 versions, such as the 1960s-era <a href="CAR-15#CAR-15_Commando_(XM177/GAU-5_series)" title="wikilink">XM177</a> family. Some of those visual designs are obvious in both weapons, however most of the similarities are not very noticeable.</p>

</figure>
<p>As with many <a href="carbine" title="wikilink">carbines</a>, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full-length <a href="rifle" class="uri" title="wikilink">rifle</a>. The price is slightly inferior ballistic performance compared to the full-size M16, with its nearly 6&quot; (15 cm) longer barrel. This becomes most apparent at ranges of 300 yards and beyond. Statistically, however, most small-arms engagements occur within 100 yards. This means that the M4 is very much an adequate weapon for the majority of troops. The marginal sacrifice in <a href="terminal_ballistics" title="wikilink">terminal ballistics</a> and range, in exchange for greatly improved handling characteristics, is usually thought to be a worthwhile compromise.</p>
<p>While the M4's maneuverability makes it a candidate for non-<a href="infantry" class="uri" title="wikilink">infantry</a> troops (vehicle crews, clerks and staff officers), it also makes it ideal for <a href="Close_Quarters_Battle" title="wikilink">close quarters battle</a> (CQB). The M4 was developed and produced for the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States government</a> by <a href="Colt&#39;s_Manufacturing_Company" title="wikilink">Colt Firearms</a>, which had an exclusive contract to produce the M4 family of weapons through 2009; however, a number of other manufacturers offer M4-like firearms. The M4A1, along with the <a href="M16_rifle#M16A4" title="wikilink">M16A4</a>, have mostly replaced the M16A2; the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">U.S. Air Force</a>, for example, plans to transition completely to the M4. The M4 is also the standard rifle for <a href="United_States_Air_Force_Security_Forces" title="wikilink">U.S. Air Force Security Forces members</a> whether at home station or deployed abroad. They maintain a yearly qualification on it.</p>
<p>The <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">United States Marine Corps</a> has ordered its officers (up to the rank of lieutenant colonel) and Staff Non-commissioned officers to carry the M4A1 carbine instead of the <a href="M9_pistol" title="wikilink">M9</a> handgun. This is in keeping with the Marine Corps motto, &quot;Every Marine is a rifleman.&quot; <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> <a href="corpsmen" class="uri" title="wikilink">corpsmen</a> will also be issued M4A1s instead of the M9.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Variants of the carbine built by different manufacturers are also in service with many other foreign special forces units, such as the <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> <a href="Australian_Special_Air_Service_Regiment" title="wikilink">Special Air Service Regiment</a> (SASR). While the SASR uses weapons of essentially the same pattern built by Colt for export (Colt uses different models to separate weapons for the U.S. military and those for commercial/export purposes), the British <a href="Special_Air_Service" title="wikilink">SAS</a> uses a variant on the basic theme, the <a href="Colt_Canada" title="wikilink">Colt Canada</a> (formerly <a href="Diemaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diemaco</a>) <a href="C8_Rifle#C8SFW" title="wikilink">C8SFW</a>.</p>

<p>Colt Model <em>925</em> carbines were tested fitted with the <a href="Knight&#39;s_Armament_Corporation" title="wikilink">Knight's Armament Corporation</a> (KAC) M4 RAS under the designation <strong>M4E2</strong>, but this designation appears to have been scrapped in favor of mounting this system to existing carbines without changing the designation. The U.S. Army Field Manual specifies for the Army that adding the Rail Adapter System (RAS) turns the weapon into the <strong>M4 MWS</strong> or <em>Modular Weapon System</em>.</p>
<h3 id="m4a1">M4A1</h3>
<p>The <strong>M4A1</strong> carbine is a fully-automatic variant of the basic M4 carbine intended for <a href="Special_forces" title="wikilink">special operations</a> use. The M4A1 has a &quot;S-1-F&quot; (safe/semi-automatic/fully automatic) trigger group, while the M4 has a &quot;S-1-3&quot; (safe/semi-automatic/3-round burst) trigger group. The M4A1 is used by almost all U.S special operation units. The M4A1 is especially favored by <a href="Counter-terrorism" title="wikilink">counter-terrorist</a> and <a href="special_forces" title="wikilink">special forces</a> units for close quarters combat because of the carbine's compactness and firepower. These features are also very useful in <a href="urban_warfare" title="wikilink">urban warfare</a>. Although the M4 has less effective range than the longer M16, many military analysts consider engagement with a non-specialized small arm above a range of  to be unnecessary. It is effective at ranges of  or less and has a maximum effective range of about .<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In the last few years, M4A1 carbines have been refit or received straight from factory with barrels with a thicker profile under the handguard. This is for a variety of reasons such as heat dissipation, which is useful due to the complaints of high-heat production from test soldiers, which occurs during full-auto and accuracy as a byproduct of barrel weight. These heavier barrel weapons are also fitted with a heavier buffer known as the H2. Out of three sliding weights inside the buffer, the H2 possesses two tungsten weights and one steel weight, versus the standard H buffer, which uses one tungsten weight and two steel weights. These weapons, known by Colt as the Model 921HB (for <em>Heavy Barrel</em>), have also been designated M4A1, and as far as the government is concerned the M4A1 represents both the <em>921</em> and <em>921HB</em>.</p>

<h3 id="sopmod-block-ii">SOPMOD Block II</h3>
<p>A second-generation SOPMOD kit (now known as <a href="SOPMOD_II" title="wikilink">SOPMOD II</a>) is currently under development, with many different manufacturers competing for the contract. Notable bidders include Knight's Armament Company, Atlantic Research Marketing Systems (ARMS), and Lewis Machine &amp; Tools. Daniel Defense has won the contract for the RIS-II, the next generation of rail handguards.</p>

<p>The M4/M4A1 5.56mm carbine is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire, shoulder-fired weapon with a telescoping stock. A shortened variant of the M16A2 rifle with a  barrel, the M4 provides the individual soldier operating in close quarters the capability to engage targets at extended range with accurate, lethal fire. The original M4 has <a href="Semi-automatic_firearm" title="wikilink">semi-automatic</a> and three-round burst fire modes, while the M4A1 has &quot;semi&quot; and &quot;full auto&quot;, with no three-round burst. The M4 has over 80% commonality with the M16A2 rifle and was intended to replace the <a href=".45_ACP" title="wikilink">.45 ACP</a> <a href="M3_submachine_gun" title="wikilink">M3 submachine guns</a> and selected M9 pistols and M16 rifle series with most Army units (this plan was thought to be changed with the development of the <a href="XM29_OICW" title="wikilink">XM29 OICW</a> and the <a href="XM8_rifle" title="wikilink">XM8 carbine</a>. However, both projects were canceled). The M4 is also capable of mounting an <a href="M203_grenade_launcher" title="wikilink">M203 grenade launcher</a>, the M203A1 with a 9-inch barrel as opposed to the standard 12-inch barrel of the M203 used on the M16 series of rifle.</p>
<p>Some features of the M4 and M4A1 compared to a full-length M16-series rifle include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact size</li>
<li>Shortened barrel </li>
<li>Telescoping buttstock</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there have been some criticisms of the carbine, such as lower <a href="muzzle_velocity" title="wikilink">muzzle velocities</a> and louder report due to the shorter barrel, additional stress on parts because of the shorter gas system, and a tendency to overheat faster than the M16A2.</p>

<p>In the fall 2007, the Army tested the M4 against three other carbines in &quot;<a href="Dust_storm" title="wikilink">sandstorm</a> conditions&quot; at <a href="Aberdeen_Proving_Ground" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Proving Ground</a>, <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>: the <a href="Heckler_&amp;_Koch" title="wikilink">Heckler &amp; Koch</a> <a href="XM8_rifle" title="wikilink">XM8 rifle</a>, <a href="Fabrique_Nationale_de_Herstal" title="wikilink">Fabrique Nationale de Herstal</a> <a href="FN_SCAR" title="wikilink">SOF Combat Assault Rifle</a> (SCAR) and the <a href="Heckler_&amp;_Koch_HK416" title="wikilink">Heckler &amp; Koch HK416</a>.

The Army said it planned to improve the M4 with a new cold-hammer-forged barrel to give longer life and more reliable magazines to reduce the stoppages. Magazine failures caused 239 of the M4's 882 failures. Army officials said the new magazines could be combat-ready by spring if testing went well.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gas-piston">Gas Piston</h3>
<p>Complicating the Army search for higher effectiveness in the M4 is a number of observations of M4 gas piston alternatives that suffer unintended design consequences. The first is that many of the gas piston modifications for the M4 isolate the piston so that the piston jams require the weapon be disassembled. The second is gas piston alternative use an off axis operation of the piston that can introduce carrier tilt where the bolt carrier fails to enter the buffer tube at straight angle resulting in part wearing. The third is that the use of a sound suppressor results in hot gases entering the chamber regardless of a direct-gas impingement or gas piston design choice. <a href="http://images.military.com/pix/defensetech/cna_m4_study_d0015259_a2.pdf">1</a></p>

<p>Colt previously held a U.S. <a href="trademark" class="uri" title="wikilink">trademark</a> on the term &quot;M4&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Many manufacturers have production firearms that are essentially identical to a military M4. Civilian models are sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;M4gery&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> (, , a <a href="portmanteau" class="uri" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of &quot;M4&quot; and &quot;forgery&quot;). Colt had maintained that it retains sole rights to the M4 name and design. Other manufacturers had long maintained that Colt had been overstating its rights, and that &quot;M4&quot; had now become a generic term for a shortened AR-15. In April 2004, Colt filed a lawsuit against <a href="Heckler_&amp;_Koch" title="wikilink">Heckler &amp; Koch</a> and <a href="Bushmaster_Firearms,_Inc." title="wikilink">Bushmaster Firearms</a>, claiming acts of <a href="trademark_infringement" title="wikilink">trademark infringement</a>, <a href="trade_dress" title="wikilink">trade dress</a> infringement, <a href="trademark_dilution" title="wikilink">trademark dilution</a>, false designation of origin, <a href="false_advertising" title="wikilink">false advertising</a>, <a href="patent_infringement" title="wikilink">patent infringement</a>, <a href="unfair_competition" title="wikilink">unfair competition</a>, and deceptive trade practices.

<h2 id="u.s.-citizen-ownership">U.S. citizen ownership</h2>
<p>Sales of select-fire or full automatic M4s by Colt are restricted to military and law enforcement agencies. Only under special circumstances can a private citizen own an M4 in a select-fire or fully automatic configuration. While many machine guns can be legally owned with a proper tax stamp from the <a href="Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives" title="wikilink">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a>, an amendment to the <a href="Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act" title="wikilink">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a> of 1986 barred the transfer to private citizens of machine guns made or registered in the U.S. after May 19, 1986. The only exception was for Special Occupational Taxpayers (SOT): licensed machine gun dealers with demonstration letters, manufacturers, and those dealing in exports and imports. As such, only the earliest Colt M4 prototypes built prior to May 19, 1986 would be legal to own by civilians not in the categories mentioned. However, as US firearms law considers the lower receiver of a M16/M4 type rifle to be the &quot;firearm&quot; (the serial numbered and, in the case of machine guns, registered under federal law, part of the weapon). Therefore the more common registered Colt M16 may be configured as an M4 by replacing the M16 upper receiver/barrel assembly with an M4 upper half, and replacing the fixed rifle stock with a 4 or 6-position telescoping M4 stock.</p>
