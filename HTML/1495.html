<p><strong>Rory Storm</strong> (21 September 1939 - 28 September 1972) was an English singer and musician. He was born Alan Caldwell in <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>. Storm was the singer and leader of Rory Storm and The Hurricanes, a <a href="Liverpudlian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpudlian</a> band who were contemporaries of <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> in the late 1950s, and early 1960s. <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a> was the <a href="drummer" class="uri" title="wikilink">drummer</a> for The Hurricanes before joining The Beatles in August 1962.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes were one of the most popular acts on the Liverpool and <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a> club scenes during their existence, although their attempt at a recording career was not successful. They released only two singles, the second one being a version of the <em><a href="West_Side_Story" title="wikilink">West Side Story</a></em> song &quot;<a href="America_(Leonard_Bernstein_song)" title="wikilink">America</a>&quot;, which was produced by The Beatles' manager <a href="Brian_Epstein" title="wikilink">Brian Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother at <em>Stormsville</em>, at 54 Broadgreen Road, <a href="Broadgreen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Broadgreen</a>, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a <a href="Lower_respiratory_tract_infection" title="wikilink">chest infection</a> and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A <a href="post_mortem" title="wikilink">post mortem</a> revealed that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that his mother had, after finding her son's body.</p>

<p>Storm and The Hurricanes were the headlining group at the first &quot;Beat Night&quot;, in the Orrell Park Ballroom, in March 1961.

<p>Starr considered leaving Storm at that time to join Derry and The Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined The Hurricanes.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and The Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in <a href="Southport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southport</a>.

<h2 id="later-life-and-death">Later life and death</h2>
<p>In 1967, O&lt;U+2019&gt;Brien (26) collapsed on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a> operation.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Storm disbanded The Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades <a href="Ice_Rink" title="wikilink">Ice Rink</a> in Liverpool, in <a href="Benidorm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benidorm</a> (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in <a href="Jersey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jersey</a> and <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at <em>Stormsville</em>. The <a href="post_mortem" title="wikilink">post mortem</a> revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental, although it could not be proven that his mother had committed <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> after finding Storm's body.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The funeral for Storm and his mother was at Oakvale Congregational Church, Broadgreen, on 19 October 1972. Mourners sang Storm's favourite song, &quot;<a href="You&#39;ll_Never_Walk_Alone_(song)" title="wikilink">You'll Never Walk Alone</a>&quot;. The two coffins were carried from the hearse to the <a href="cremation" class="uri" title="wikilink">cremation</a> (at Anfield Crematorium) by former band members.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> When Starr was asked why he did not attend, he said, &quot;I wasn't there when he was born either.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Although Starr had often offered to arrange for Storm to record whenever he wanted to, Storm was not interested in finding new or original material. His sister said: &quot;He [Storm] was happy to be the King of Liverpool - he was never keen on touring, he didn't want to give up running for the Pembroke Harriers...and he'd never miss a Liverpool <a href="soccer" title="wikilink">football</a> match!&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Fury, whom Storm had met at the Wyvern Club auditions, later played the part of a singer called Stormy Tempest in the film, <em><a href="That&#39;ll_Be_the_Day_(film)" title="wikilink">That'll Be the Day</a></em> (1973) which was based on Storm. In 1987, a <a href="musical_theatre" title="wikilink">musical</a> was staged in Liverpool about Storm and The Hurricanes called <em>A Need For Heroes</em>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
