The squadron was formed in February 1942 for standard transport duties during World War II, initially flying <a href="de_Havilland_Dragon" title="wikilink">de Havilland DH.84 Dragons</a> in Northern Australia. In 1943 it re-equipped with <a href="Douglas_C-47_Skytrain" title="wikilink">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>, which it operated in <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a> prior to disbanding in June 1946.</p>
<p>The unit was re-established in March 1948 as No. 34 (Communications) Squadron at <a href="RAAF_Base_Mallala" title="wikilink">RAAF Station Mallala</a>, South Australia, where it supported activities at the <a href="Woomera_Test_Range" title="wikilink">Woomera Rocket Range</a> before disbanding in October 1955. It was re-raised as No. 34 (VIP) Flight in March 1956 at RAAF Base Canberra (later Fairbairn). No. 34 Flight was redesignated No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron in July 1959, and No. 34 Squadron in June 1963. During the 1960s it operated Dakotas, <a href="Convair_CV-240_family" title="wikilink">Convair Metropolitans</a>, <a href="Vickers_Viscount" title="wikilink">Vickers Viscounts</a>, <a href="Dassault_Falcon_20" title="wikilink">Dassault Falcon-Mysteres</a>, <a href="Hawker_Siddeley_HS&amp;nbsp;748" title="wikilink">Hawker Siddeley HS&amp;nbsp;748s</a>, and <a href="BAC_One-Eleven" title="wikilink">BAC 1-11s</a>, the last three types continuing in service until the late 1980s. The squadron's fleet consisted solely of <a href="Dassault_Falcon&amp;nbsp;900" title="wikilink">Dassault Falcon&amp;nbsp;900s</a> from 1989 until 2002, when it began operating the 737 and Challenger.</p>
