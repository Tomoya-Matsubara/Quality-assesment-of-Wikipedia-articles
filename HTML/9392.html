<p>The <strong>fourteenth legislative assembly election</strong> was held on 13 April 2011 to elect members from 234 constituencies in <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a>. Results were released on 13 May 2011. Two major parties <a href="Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam" title="wikilink">Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam</a> (DMK) and <a href="All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam" title="wikilink">All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam</a> (AIADMK) faced the election as coalitions of multiple parties with the DMK front consisting of 8 parties and the AIADMK of 11 parties. <a href="Vijayakanth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vijayakanth</a>'s <a href="Desiya_Murpokku_Dravida_Kazhagam" title="wikilink">Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam</a> (DMDK) which had contested the previous elections independently allied with AIADMK coalition. <a href="Marumalarchi_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam" title="wikilink">Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam</a> boycotted the election following disagreement with Jayalalitha over seat-sharing. Tamil film actor <a href="Vijay_(actor)" title="wikilink">Vijay</a> for the first time was openly involved in Tamil Nadu politics by extending his support for ADMK.</p>
<p>The outgoing Karunanidhi government was noted for the construction of <a href="Tamil_Nadu_legislative_assembly-secretariat_complex" title="wikilink">new assembly building</a> in <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a>, execution of various developmental projects and implementation of new entitlement programs including free health care for the poor and issuance of a range of freebies such as color television to all. The numerous achievements of the administration was overshadowed by other major issues such as increasing prizes of essential items, <a href="2G_spectrum_scam" title="wikilink">2G spectrum scam</a> and undue influence of Karunanidhi's extended family in various aspects of Tamil politics and business.</p>
<p>The election commission enforced stringent measures to curb use of money power to bribe voters by paying them cash and stricter campaign descipline by imposing the 10 PM curfew. The commission headed by the chief election officer <a href="Praveen_Kumar_(Chief_Electoral_Officer)" title="wikilink">Praveen Kumar</a> was commended for conducting the election in a strict and fair manner. The election recorded the highest polling ever in the state - 77.8% of the total electorate voted in the election surpassing 76.57% polled in <a href="Madras_State_legislative_assembly_election,_1967" title="wikilink">1967 election</a>.</p>
<p>AIADMK front won the election, winning in 203 constituencies, with the AIADMK party itself winning 150 seats thus securing a simple majority to be able to form the government without the support of its coalition partners. DMDK won 29 seats more than the 23 seats won by DMK and chose to serve as an opposition party. Political analysts concluded that the election was a referendum on the outgoing DMK government and the powerful anti-incumbency sentiment helped the ADMK colaition. The results set the stage for the swearing-in of <a href="J._Jayalalitha" title="wikilink">J. Jayalalitha</a> for the third time as the Chief minister of Tamil Nadu.</p>

The government provided 1kg rice for 1 rupee, free health insurance for poor, free color television and gas stove for all. It also provided job for over 500,000 people in various departments of the government and introduced free concrete house scheme for the poor. It also implemented various road, bridge and drinking water projects in <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a> and all over Tamil Nadu.

Inflation was high during late 2010 to early 2011. The price of food and other essential commodities had increased exponentially affecting middle class and poor people. Onions were sold for Rs. 100, tomatoes for Rs. 80 and Jasmine flower for Rs. 1200 per kilo gram. This historical rise in price of essential food items was believed to be due to increased rainfall in North Indian states.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The 2G spectrum scam in India involved the issue of 122 licenses of the 2G spectrum to 85 companies including many new telecom companies with little or no experience in the telecom sector at a price set in the year 2001.

<p>While pre-polls and exit polls released before the counting showed a mixed picture and a close race, the early trends and final results pointed to a landslide victory for the AIADMK alliance and <a href="Jayalalithaa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jayalalithaa</a> heading towards her third term as Chief Minister. <a href="M._Karunanidhi" title="wikilink">M. Karunanidhi</a>, after suffering a huge loss, submitted his resignation to Governor <a href="Surjit_Singh_Barnala" title="wikilink">Surjit Singh Barnala</a>, paving way for Jayalalithaa to swear in on <a href="May_15" title="wikilink">May 15</a>. While spiraling prices, power cut, and DMK's family politics were important factors, many analysts agree that it was the corruption charges (2G spectrum scandal), that eventually led them to their ultimate defeat. This election saw Congress' worst performance in Tamil Nadu, bagging only 5 seats out of 63 seats it contested. During the campaign, they were marred with in-fighting between state Congress leader <a href="K.V._Thangkabalu" title="wikilink">K.V. Thangkabalu</a> and other Congress members and their declining support in the state.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> <a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a>.In both tamil nadu and pondicherry congress was badly defeated. In Tamil nadu it was pushed to 6th position with 5 seats this is mainly due the support rendered by congress government in Ellam and it's attitude towards tamil people.DMK which supported congress because it is seen as Tamil centric party got the worst defeat because of its alliance with congress. After the election, <a href="Jayalalithaa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jayalalithaa</a> thanked her supporters and said &quot;this is not a victory for me, but a victory for the state and the country&quot;. She further stated that she wants to &quot;rebuild the state, from the havoc created by the previous government&quot; and insisted that she does not plan to share power with her allies.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> DMDK leader, Vijaykanth, after being the second largest party in the new assembly and an important ally of AIADMK, stated that this is a &quot;victory for the people and an end to family rule&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> TDP leader and former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, <a href="Chandrababu_Naidu" title="wikilink">Chandrababu Naidu</a>, called and congratulated Jayalalithaa on her &quot;victory over corruption&quot;.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> After the loss, Congress leader <a href="Jayanthi_Natarajan" title="wikilink">Jayanthi Natarajan</a>, conceded defeat and wished the best for incoming CM, Jayalalithaa. While she admitted that 2G spectrum scam played a huge role in their defeat, she further re-iterated that they have done everything they can to be transparent and that action has been taken against individuals responsible for the corruption. Union Minister, <a href="P._Chidambaram" title="wikilink">P. Chidambaram</a> admitted that this was a huge loss for Congress in Tamil Nadu but does not believe this will affect the UPA government at the center, due to the fact that this was a loss of an alliance led by DMK and not INC. <a href="M._Karunanidhi" title="wikilink">M. Karunanidhi</a> after the loss stated, &quot;People have given me proper rest&quot; and went on to congratulate AIADMK on their victory.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
