<p><strong>Dennis Wayne Johnson</strong> (September 18, 1954 &lt;U+2013&gt; February 22, 2007), nicknamed &quot;<strong>DJ</strong>&quot;, was an American professional <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player for the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a>'s (NBA) <a href="Seattle_SuperSonics" title="wikilink">Seattle SuperSonics</a>, <a href="Phoenix_Suns" title="wikilink">Phoenix Suns</a> and <a href="Boston_Celtics" title="wikilink">Boston Celtics</a> and coach of the <a href="Los_Angeles_Clippers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Clippers</a>. He was an alumnus of <a href="Dominguez_High_School" title="wikilink">Dominguez High School</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles_Harbor_College" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Harbor College</a> and <a href="Pepperdine_University" title="wikilink">Pepperdine University</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early struggles<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and had a successful NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the <a href="Seattle_SuperSonics" title="wikilink">Seattle SuperSonics</a>, Johnson began his professional career as a <a href="shooting_guard" title="wikilink">shooting guard</a>. He eventually led the Sonics to their only NBA championship in <a href="1979_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1979</a>, winning the <a href="Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award (MVP)</a>. After a short stint with the <a href="Phoenix_Suns" title="wikilink">Phoenix Suns</a>, he became the starting <a href="point_guard" title="wikilink">point guard</a> for the <a href="Boston_Celtics" title="wikilink">Boston Celtics</a>, with whom he won two more championships. Johnson was voted into five All-Star Teams, one <a href="All-NBA_Team" title="wikilink">All-NBA</a> First and one Second Team, and nine consecutive <a href="NBA_All-Defensive_Team" title="wikilink">All-Defensive First and Second Teams</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper, Johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in NBA playoffs history.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Celtics franchise has retired Johnson's number 3 jersey, which hangs from the rafters of the <a href="TD_Garden" title="wikilink">TD Garden</a>, the home arena of the team. On April 5, 2010, the Naismith Memorial <a href="Basketball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Basketball Hall of Fame</a> officially announced that Johnson had been posthumously elected to the Hall and would be formally inducted on August 13.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Dennis Wayne Johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in <a href="Compton,_California" title="wikilink">Compton</a> in Los Angeles, California.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Originally a baseball fan and a <a href="Little_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Little Leaguer</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at <a href="Dominguez_High_School" title="wikilink">Dominguez High School</a>, Johnson measured just 5'9&quot; and played only &quot;a minute or two each game&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3&quot;,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and developed what nba.com later described as &quot;rocket launcher legs&quot;, which enabled him to jump high to grab <a href="rebound_(basketball)" title="wikilink">rebounds</a> against taller opponents.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Jim White, the coach at <a href="Los_Angeles_Harbor_College" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Harbor College</a>, had watched Johnson play <a href="Streetball" title="wikilink">street basketball</a>; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked him to enroll.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown out of the team three times in two years.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of his junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: <a href="Azusa_Pacific_University" title="wikilink">Azusa Pacific University</a> and <a href="Pepperdine_University" title="wikilink">Pepperdine University</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the <a href="1976_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1976 NBA Draft</a>, but was skeptical that any team would take him.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.</p>

<p>The <a href="Seattle_SuperSonics" title="wikilink">Seattle SuperSonics</a> took Johnson in the second round of the 1976 draft with the 29th pick and gave him a four-year contract, with which he earned a salary of $45,000 in the first year and $90,000 in the last.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In his rookie year, the <a href="1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77 NBA season</a>, Johnson, playing backup to the experienced Sonics backcourt tandem of <a href="Slick_Watts" title="wikilink">Slick Watts</a> and <a href="Fred_Brown_(basketball)" title="wikilink">Fred Brown</a>, averaged 9.2 points and 1.5 assists per game.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Sonics finished with a 40&lt;U+2013&gt;42 record<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and missed the <a href="1977_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1977 NBA Playoffs</a>, leading head coach <a href="Bill_Russell" title="wikilink">Bill Russell</a> to resign.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In the following <a href="1977&lt;U+2013&gt;78_NBA_season" title="wikilink">season</a>, the team lost 17 of the first 22 games under Russell's replacement <a href="Bob_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Bob Hopkins</a>, who was replaced by Hall of Fame coach <a href="Lenny_Wilkens" title="wikilink">Lenny Wilkens</a>, who gave Johnson a starting spot and paired him with <a href="Gus_Williams" title="wikilink">Gus Williams</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Johnson revelled in this new role, improving his averages to 12.7 points and 2.8 assists per game.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> During this period Johnson played <a href="shooting_guard" title="wikilink">shooting guard</a> and was known for his aggressive <a href="slam_dunk" title="wikilink">slam dunking</a>, in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> It was at this time that Johnson's nickname &quot;DJ&quot; was coined by play-by-play announcer <a href="Bob_Blackburn_(announcer)" title="wikilink">Bob Blackburn</a>, to help distinguish him from teammates <a href="John_Johnson_(basketball)" title="wikilink">John Johnson</a> and <a href="Vinnie_Johnson" title="wikilink">Vinnie Johnson</a> (whom Blackburn referred to as &quot;JJ&quot; and &quot;VJ&quot; respectively).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Finishing strongly, the Sonics ended the regular season with a 47&lt;U+2013&gt;35 record and made the <a href="1978_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1978 NBA Playoffs</a>. After eliminating the <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, the defending champion <a href="Portland_Trail_Blazers" title="wikilink">Portland Trail Blazers</a> and the <a href="Denver_Nuggets" title="wikilink">Denver Nuggets</a>, they almost defeated the <a href="Washington_Bullets" title="wikilink">Washington Bullets</a> by taking a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 lead in the <a href="1978_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1978 NBA Finals</a>. In a 93&lt;U+2013&gt;92 Game 3 victory, Johnson blocked seven shots&lt;U+2014&gt;the most blocks in NBA Finals history for a guard.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, the Sonics lost in seven games, partly because of Johnson's Game 7 scoring drought, in which the second-year guard missed all of his 14 field goal attempts.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Johnson later acknowledged that he simply &quot;choked&quot;; he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson and the Sonics got their revenge in the <a href="1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79 season</a>. After clinching the Pacific Division with a 52&lt;U+2013&gt;30 record,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> the team met the Bullets again in the <a href="1979_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1979 NBA Finals</a>. After losing Game 1, the Sonics won the next four games to take the finals series, helped by Johnson, who averaged almost 23 points along with six rebounds and assists per game.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He scored 32 points in a Game 4 overtime victory, and was named <a href="NBA_Finals_MVP" title="wikilink">NBA Finals MVP</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It was during this season that Johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league; he averaged 15.9 points and 3.5 assists per game, and made his first All-Defensive First Team and All-Star Game appearance.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="1979&lt;U+2013&gt;80_NBA_season" title="wikilink">following season</a>, Johnson averaged 19.0 points and 4.1 assists, appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the All-Defensive First Team and All-NBA Second Team.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> However, the Sonics lost in the <a href="1980_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">Western Conference Finals</a> against the Lakers, who had Hall of Famers <a href="Magic_Johnson" title="wikilink">Magic Johnson</a> and <a href="Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar" title="wikilink">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>. Because of the abundance of talent on the losing Sonics team, Johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Coach Wilkens grew tired of Johnson, who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability for the team.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> At the end of the season, Johnson was traded to the <a href="Phoenix_Suns" title="wikilink">Phoenix Suns</a> for <a href="Paul_Westphal" title="wikilink">Paul Westphal</a> and draft picks.

<h3 id="phoenix-suns-1980u201383">Phoenix Suns (1980&lt;U+2013&gt;83)</h3>
<p>In Phoenix, Johnson further established himself as a quality player. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14&lt;U+2013&gt;20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In this period, Johnson played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the second or third option as a Sonic.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In the first two years of Johnson's stint, the Suns were fairly successful, reaching the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons.

<h3 id="boston-celtics-1983u201390">Boston Celtics (1983&lt;U+2013&gt;90)</h3>
<p>Before the <a href="1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84 season</a>, the Celtics had repeatedly lost to the <a href="Philadelphia_76ers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia 76ers</a> in the NBA Playoffs, mainly because physical Sixers guard <a href="Andrew_Toney" title="wikilink">Andrew Toney</a> routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt. Thus, Celtics general manager <a href="Red_Auerbach" title="wikilink">Red Auerbach</a> added the perennial All-Defensive Team member Johnson to his squad.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Johnson joined a squad led by Hall of Fame forward <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a>, who played in the frontcourt with two fellow Hall of Famers, center <a href="Robert_Parish" title="wikilink">Robert Parish</a> and forward <a href="Kevin_McHale" title="wikilink">Kevin McHale</a>, a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the NBA.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Johnson described joining the Celtics as a &quot;dream come true&quot; and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager Auerbach, who was &quot;living history&quot; according to Johnson.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>With the Celtics, Johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career: after being known as a <a href="slam_dunk" title="wikilink">slam dunking</a> shooting guard with the Sonics, and an all-around scorer with the Suns, he now established himself as a <a href="point_guard" title="wikilink">point guard</a> who was defined more by playmaking than scoring.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In his first year as a Celtic, he averaged 13.2 points and 4.2 assists and was elected to the All-Defensive Second Team.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The Celtics reached the <a href="1984_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1984 NBA Finals</a>, where they met the <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, their intense <a href="Lakers&lt;U+2013&gt;Celtics_rivalry" title="wikilink">rivals since the 1960s</a>. The Celtics won 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3, and Johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on Hall of Fame Lakers playmaker Magic Johnson, limiting him to a sub-average 17 points in the last four games,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> and being at least partly responsible for several of the Laker point guard's game-deciding errors in Games 2, 4 and 7. As a result, Magic Johnson was taunted as &quot;Tragic Johnson&quot; whenever the Lakers and Celtics played against each other.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1984&lt;U+2013&gt;85_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1984&lt;U+2013&gt;85 season</a>, Johnson continued playing smothering defense, earning his next All-Defensive Second Team call-up while averaging 16.9 points and 7.3 assists per game.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The Celtics met the Lakers in the <a href="1985_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1985 NBA Finals</a> again. Johnson's big moment came in Game 4: when the score was tied 105&lt;U+2013&gt;105, teammate <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a> had the ball in the last seconds. Being double-teamed by Lakers <a href="Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar" title="wikilink">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> and Magic Johnson, Bird passed to the open Johnson, and the guard sank a  <a href="buzzer_beater" title="wikilink">buzzer beater</a> to win the game.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> However, the Lakers took their revenge this time, winning the series in six games, powered by venerable 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar. Johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career, because the Celtics were &quot;close [to winning the series]&quot; but &quot;could not get the job done&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86_NBA_season" title="wikilink">following season</a>, the Celtics made the playoffs, helped by the performance of Johnson, who made the All-Defensive Second Team again while scoring 17.8 points and 6.7 assists per game.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> After defeating the <a href="Milwaukee_Bucks" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Bucks</a> in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics reached the <a href="1986_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1986 NBA Finals</a> against the up-and-coming <a href="Houston_Rockets" title="wikilink">Houston Rockets</a>, led by the &quot;Twin Towers&quot; of centers <a href="Ralph_Sampson" title="wikilink">Ralph Sampson</a> and <a href="Hakeem_Olajuwon" title="wikilink">Hakeem Olajuwon</a>. Led by Finals MVP Larry Bird, the Celtics beat the Rockets 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2, and Johnson won his third title.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The Celtics were unable to repeat their title in <a href="1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1987</a> despite several dramatic playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive Second Team,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the <a href="1987_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals</a>, the Celtics split the first six games against the <a href="Milwaukee_Bucks" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Bucks</a> 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center <a href="Jack_Sikma" title="wikilink">Jack Sikma</a>. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In the next round, the <a href="1987_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1987 Eastern Conference Finals</a>, the Celtics faced the <a href="Detroit_Pistons" title="wikilink">Detroit Pistons</a>. The series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals, featuring a great level of personal animosity, <a href="trash_talk" title="wikilink">sharp rhetoric</a> and several physical altercations. The center of this feud was Pistons pivot <a href="Bill_Laimbeer" title="wikilink">Bill Laimbeer</a>, who brawled with Celtics players Bird and Parish.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In Game 5, Johnson was involved in a crucial play: down by one point, <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a> stole an inbound pass by Pistons point guard <a href="Isiah_Thomas" title="wikilink">Isiah Thomas</a> with six seconds left and passed it to a sprinting Johnson, who converted a difficult layup as time expired.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This play caused Celtics broadcaster <a href="Johnny_Most" title="wikilink">Johnny Most</a> to shout out one of his most famous quotes:<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a>  According to Johnson, this was his favorite play of all-time.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Game 6 and Game 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward <a href="Dennis_Rodman" title="wikilink">Dennis Rodman</a> and Johnson. In Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted Johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the <a href="1987_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1987 NBA Finals</a>, however, the Celtics succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP Magic Johnson put up a great performance, averaging 26 points and 13 assists throughout the series.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Furthermore, Johnson is lauded by the NBA as a versatile all-around weapon who played with &quot;contagious competitiveness&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> and was known for his durability: in 14 NBA seasons, he played in 1,100 of a possible 1,148 games and participated in 180 playoff games, the latter figure the 11th highest number of all time.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> At his retirement, Johnson was only the 11th NBA player to amass more than 15,000 points and 5,000 assists.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 13, 1991, the Celtics franchise retired his number 3 jersey. Johnson said he would always be a Boston Celtic, and remarked that seeing his number in the rafters gave him a &quot;special feeling&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> However, Johnson did not live to see an induction into the <a href="Basketball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Basketball Hall of Fame</a>, a fact that has been a considerable point of debate with sports journalists. <a href="Bill_Simmons" title="wikilink">Bill Simmons</a> of <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a> called his Hall of Fame snub an &quot;ongoing injustice&quot;, stating that according to him, <a href="Joe_Dumars" title="wikilink">Joe Dumars</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; a Hall of Famer known for strong defense rather than spectacular scoring, like Johnson &lt;U+2013&gt; was no better [a basketball player] than him.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Colleague Ken Shouler called Johnson &quot;one of the first guys I'd give a Hall [of Fame] pass&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Contemporary Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a> gave Johnson ultimate praise, calling him the best teammate he ever had in his biography <em>Drive</em>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a>, which is especially significant considering Bird's teammates included Hall of Famers <a href="Kevin_McHale" title="wikilink">Kevin McHale</a>, <a href="Robert_Parish" title="wikilink">Robert Parish</a>, <a href="Bill_Walton" title="wikilink">Bill Walton</a>, and <a href="Tiny_Archibald" title="wikilink">Tiny Archibald</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a>.

<p>On October 26, 2007, a learning center was dedicated in Johnson's name in the Central Branch of the YMCA of Greater Boston. The center was made possible by the donations and effort of Larry Bird and M.L. Carr. Johnson's family, Danny Ainge, Carr, and members of the YMCA and local community were present for the ribbon cutting ceremony. Donna Johnson said on behalf of her husband, &quot;If Dennis were alive he would really appreciate the thought and love the idea of the Learning Center.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>Dennis Johnson was married to Donna, his wife of 31 years, and had three children named Dwayne, Denise and Daniel.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Johnson was also known for his unusual appearance: despite being <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a>, he had <a href="freckles" class="uri" title="wikilink">freckles</a> and reddish hair.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 20, 1997, he was arrested and detained overnight for allegedly holding a knife to his wife's throat and threatening his 17-year old son.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Johnson was later charged with aggravated assault and was ordered to stay away from his family.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The prosecutors dropped the case several months later after his wife declined to press charges.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Johnson reportedly went to <a href="Relationship_counseling" title="wikilink">counseling</a> to repair his marriage.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
