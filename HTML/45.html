<p><strong><em>Big Brother 5</em></strong> in <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> was the fifth season of <strong><em><a href="Big_Brother_(UK)" title="wikilink">Big Brother</a></em></strong> in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a>, a <a href="reality_television" title="wikilink">reality show</a> shown on <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> in which a number of contestants live in an isolated house trying to avoid being evicted by the public with the aim of winning a large cash prize at the end of the run.</p>
<h2 id="housemates">Housemates</h2>
<h3 id="ahmed-aghil">Ahmed Aghil</h3>
<p>Ahmed Aghil (born March, <a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>) fled to Britain from <a href="Somalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> during the early <a href="1990s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990s</a>, and is now a successful <a href="property_developer" title="wikilink">property developer</a> and has graduated with a <a href="academic_degree" title="wikilink">degree</a> in <a href="law" class="uri" title="wikilink">law</a>. He gained a reputation for his eccentricity and his inexplicable outbursts of violence while in the house. He always remained least favourite to win, with odds ranging from 33/1 to 50/1.</p>
<p>Ahmed usually spent time alone in the garden, or asleep. He was fairly sedate, in sharp contrast to most of the house, meaning that he did not bond with anyone in the house much, and indeed was fairly irritated by many of the housemates.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of participation in the programme, Ahmed began to have spontaneous violent outbursts, in which he threw plates around, chopped the head of a <a href="papier-m&lt;U+00E2&gt;ch&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">papier-m&lt;U+00E2&gt;ch&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> statue off with a spade and screamed out loud (the first two were in response to the playing into the house of a crying baby, the first time to try to wake the housemates up, the second time to try to get them to talk after they refused to speak for a day in protest at failing a task. He explained his behaviour later on by stating that as a father, he found the sound of a crying baby extremely <a href="disturbing" class="uri" title="wikilink">disturbing</a>). It eventually became clear that he was under enormous psychological pressure in the house, and that he was becoming increasingly deranged-he recognised this himself, but refused to leave the house of his own accord, since he harboured a dream of having an eviction night and interview like all other evictees (he referred to this as &quot;his night&quot;). Eventually, it got to the point where he was asking the other housemates to nominate him for eviction. Even when he did so, he was not evicted.</p>
<p>He became somewhat unpopular in the house, with the public turning against him after an incident in the house during a weekly &quot;Big Brother <a href="Basic_Combat_Training" title="wikilink">Boot Camp</a>&quot; task, in which he was assigned the role of a <a href="Private_(rank)" title="wikilink">private</a> (along with 5 other housemates) while two others were assigned the role of <a href="sergeant" class="uri" title="wikilink">sergeant</a>. He refused to do several activities as required by the task, came to blows with (more popular) sergeant Michelle and eventually tried to instigate a <a href="military_coup" title="wikilink">military coup</a>. In an interview with the <a href="Daily_Mirror" title="wikilink">Daily Mirror</a> after the show had finished, he said that his reluctance to take part in the task was due to the memories of the militia in his own country that contributed to his claim for asylum in the UK. Despite this, the group passed the task: however, in accordance with the rules of the task, the privates were immediately up for eviction. He was evicted with 56% of the vote. In his post-eviction interview, he remarked that he did not expect to remain in the house past the third week. Ahmed recently appeared on <a href="The_Friday_Night_Project" title="wikilink">The Friday Night Project</a>, and on entering the stage he threw a stack of plates to the ground, smashing them.</p>
<h3 id="becki-seddiki">Becki Seddiki</h3>
<p>Becki Seddiki (born <a href="July_24" title="wikilink">July 24</a>, <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>) is a <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a> from London, with Italian and Moroccan blood. Big Brother told her she must nominate a housemate for eviction, she must kiss the housemate to indicate who she has chosen, this was compulsory. Her choice of Michelle as recipient of her 'Judas kiss' was hugely unpopular with viewers and resulted in her being evicted at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Since Big Brother, Becki has landed a twice weekly radio DJing slot on a radio station in London (from 2006 onwards) and is still recording her music and performing at several gigs all over the UK.</p>
<h3 id="daniel-bryan">Daniel Bryan</h3>
<p>Daniel (born <a href="January_3" title="wikilink">January 3</a>, <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>) is a <a href="hairdresser" class="uri" title="wikilink">hairdresser</a> from <a href="Kingston_upon_Hull" title="wikilink">Hull</a>. During his stay in the house, Daniel made clear that he was gay due to many conversations about fellow housemate Jason's &quot;bum&quot; and many conversations about men. Dan finished third behind Jason and Nadia. He was an extremely popular contestant on the show and was at one point nicknamed &quot;Dandalf&quot; due to his excessive wearing of a grey hooded dressing gown.</p>
<h3 id="emma-greenwood">Emma Greenwood</h3>
<p>One of the <em>lip gloss bitches</em>, Emma (born <a href="October_12" title="wikilink">October 12</a>, <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>) was formerly an <a href="administration" title="wikilink">admin</a> assistant. She was removed from the house for safety reasons after the notorious &quot;fight night&quot; in which she played a leading role. Emma is originally from <a href="Oldham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oldham</a>, Greater Manchester and had a minor singing career before and after her time in the house. Emma has also been a member of the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a></p>
<p>Since leaving the Big Brother house Emma enjoyed her &quot;moment of fame&quot; by making various public appearances, as well as appearing along side former Housemate Michelle Bass on the softcore porn channel Television X, performing links between clips during the Freeview.</p>
<p>Emma moved into a flat in London with fellow housemate Marco for several months until ultimately returning to the army.</p>
<h3 id="jason-cowan">Jason Cowan</h3>
<p>Jason Cowan, <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a> <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a>, in <a href="Hamilton,_South_Lanarkshire" title="wikilink">Hamilton, South Lanarkshire</a>. The runner-up of the series. During the house, he formed a friendship with Victor Ebuwa and Ahmed Aghil that led to the formation of a prominent clique known as the Jungle Cats. Cowan's presence at the end brought a balance to the house after all the villains had left and only friends or people that sat on the fence were left. He spent most of his time laying in bed and bitching about the other housemates with Victor, shaving every conceivable part of his body for lengthy periods of time, and exercising almost constantly. Happy on entry to the house, Jason became the house villain, he and Nadia hated each other for the second half of the show. He and Victor also had a strong dislike for the group Victor dubbed &quot;The Hareem&quot; consisting of Marco, Michelle, Emma, Nadia and to a lesser extent Stuart.</p>
<p>He was in Five's recent show <em>Commando VIP</em>, in which he and five other celebrities had to complete SAS-style tasks.</p>
<h3 id="kathryn-kitten-pinder">Kathryn &quot;Kitten&quot; Pinder</h3>
<p>Kathryn (&quot;Kat&quot;, or &quot;Kitten&quot;) Pinder (born <a href="October_13" title="wikilink">October 13</a>, <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a>) is a <a href="human_rights" title="wikilink">human</a> and <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a> <a href="activist" class="uri" title="wikilink">activist</a>. She entered the house on <a href="May_28" title="wikilink">May 28</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> and was ejected one week later on <a href="June_4" title="wikilink">June 4</a> after continuously breaking house rules and receiving three formal warnings. After her ejection, Kitten occasionally appeared on the parallel show <em><a href="Big_Brother&#39;s_Little_Brother" title="wikilink">Big Brother's Little Brother</a></em>, also on Channel 4.</p>
<p>Kitten describes herself as an <a href="anarchist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchist</a>, heavily involved in <a href="political_activism" title="wikilink">political activism</a> and opposition to war, the <a href="class_society" title="wikilink">class society</a> and <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>. Before becoming an anarchist, she used to be a member/supporter of the <a href="Alliance_for_Workers_Liberty" title="wikilink">Alliance for Workers Liberty</a>. She also claimed to be a prostitute in London at the age of 16, although her father denied this in the press, stating that she was in <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a> in <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a> at the time. She was also previously a student at the <a href="University_of_Hull" title="wikilink">University of Hull</a>. Kitten moved to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> with her <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> lover in late 2004 in order to make a fresh start after she claimed to have been shunned by the <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> community following her actions whilst in the Big Brother house.</p>
<p>On entering the Big Brother house, Kitten refused to enter until she had seen her girlfriend and made obscene gestures to the crowd and the media. This action led her to be the first housemate to be booed on entry to the house. Her behaviour did not improve once in the house as she refused to obey the rules of Big Brother, leading to three official warnings.</p>
<p>In an effort to get Kitten to toe the line, Big Brother warned the housemates that they would evict any housemate without warning if Kitten continued to break the rules. However Kitten again broke the rules by daubing anti-war slogans on the wall of the house. On the second week, live on Channel 4, Kitten was finally ejected from the house for her persistent rule-breaking, initially refusing to leave. She was eventually removed from the house after <em>Big Brother</em> began reducing the &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 prize fund by &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 for every 6 seconds she stayed in the house. On leaving Kitten shouted at the media against the <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen</a> and the <a href="Aristocracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristocracy</a>.</p>
<p>Some days later she appeared in court regarding her non-payment of parking fines amounting to &lt;U+00A3&gt;225. She blamed it on <a href="Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">Tony Blair</a>'s education policy, saying she could not pay the fines because of student debts.</p>
<h3 id="marco-sabba">Marco Sabba</h3>
<p>Marco Jaye Sabba (born <a href="April_20" title="wikilink">April 20</a>, <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>) was a <a href="law_student" title="wikilink">law student</a> from <a href="Kingston_University" title="wikilink">Kingston University</a>, and was particularly friendly with <a href="Nadia_Almada" title="wikilink">Nadia Almada</a>,Emma Greenwood and Michelle Bass. The quartet called themselves the 'lip gloss bitches', but were dubbed Marco's harem by Victor. Also, he hilariously tripped his own mother by sliding along a slippery stage when he emerged from the Big Brother house. Marco has appeared in a West End stage show and reappeared on British Television since leaving the Big Brother house. He, along with fellow housemate Emma, provided a commentary of <em><a href="Celebrity_Big_Brother_UK" title="wikilink">Celebrity Big Brother UK</a></em> on <em><a href="Richard_and_Judy" title="wikilink">Richard and Judy</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="michelle-bass">Michelle Bass</h3>

<p>Michelle Bass (born <a href="February_2" title="wikilink">February 2</a>, <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> in <a href="Newcastle_Upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle</a>) was formerly a <a href="mortgage_advisor" title="wikilink">mortgage advisor</a>. She was a member of the 'Lip gloss Bitches', along with Marco Sabba, Emma Greenwood and <a href="Nadia_Almada" title="wikilink">Nadia Almada</a>. She was best known for her the spell in the bedsit with Emma Greenwood, as well as her relationship with Stuart Wilson - they allegedly became the first couple to have sex live on British television after Michelle fashioned a &quot;fort&quot; from a table, chairs and table cloth so that they could have some privacy from the cameras. Michelle was referred to as a &quot;bunny boiler&quot; by the press due to her obsessive pursuit of Stuart. She also referred to most people by the pet-name &quot;chicken&quot; which became a popular catchphrase during her time in the house. Michelle and Stuart remained a couple for some time following <a href="Big_Brother" title="wikilink">Big Brother</a>, but eventually split up. She has since featured on <a href="Television_X" title="wikilink">Television X</a>, performing links between clips during the Freeview and has participated in phootshoot with the British men's magazine; Nuts. Michelle had previously admitted to being a fan of <a href="pornography" class="uri" title="wikilink">pornography</a> in her <a href="Big_Brother" title="wikilink">Big Brother</a> audition.</p>
<h3 id="michelle-shell-jubin">Michelle &quot;Shell&quot; Jubin</h3>
<p>Shell, (originally from <a href="Hampshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, later moved to <a href="Selkirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Selkirk</a> before attending University), was a former <a href="History_of_Art" title="wikilink">History of Art</a> <a href="student" class="uri" title="wikilink">student</a> and lived in <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> where she still has a home.

In 2006 Shell moved to <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> in order to work at the <a href="Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum" title="wikilink">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nadia-almada">Nadia Almada</h3>

<p><strong>Nadia Almada</strong> (born <a href="January_28" title="wikilink">January 28</a>, <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>) was born on the Portuguese Island of <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>, under the name of Jorge, but she was known as Carlos. She moved to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a> and worked in a <a href="department_store" title="wikilink">department store</a> in <a href="Woking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woking</a>, where she lives. She has also managed a children's book store. Before entering the Big Brother house she worked as a cashier in a well-known bank.</p>
<p><a href="The_Sun_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a> dubbed Nadia the Portugeezer, the &quot;Portuguese Man O' War&quot; and NADS, NADS being a <a href="slang" class="uri" title="wikilink">slang</a> term for <a href="gonads" class="uri" title="wikilink">gonads</a> (<a href="testicles" class="uri" title="wikilink">testicles</a>) <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>She became the first <a href="transwoman" class="uri" title="wikilink">transwoman</a> in the Big Brother house, competing in the 2004 series in the UK. After 71 days in the house she emerged as the winner, securing 74% of the overall vote and winning &lt;U+00A3&gt;63,500.</p>
<h3 id="stuart-wilson">Stuart Wilson</h3>
<p>Stuart Wilson (born <a href="April_28" title="wikilink">April 28</a> <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>) is a <a href="student" class="uri" title="wikilink">student</a> from <a href="Macclesfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macclesfield</a>. He was initially a member of the jungle cats, although when things got serious with Michelle, he was neither here nor there. He was best known in the house for his relationship with Michelle and for his constant need to dress up and child-like personality. He claimed to be the most intelligent contestant ever to appear on Big Brother.</p>
<p>During one task, Stuart was given a cowboy outfit which he fell in love with; particularly with the hat. After eventually giving it back to Big Brother, he asked for it back again. They gave him an oversized one instead, and then a miniature one. Later on, when the contestants refused to co-operate with Big Brother, they put the TVs on and showed them burning the original hat, much to the distress of Stuart. Throughout all this, up until the burning, <em>Big Brother's Little Brother</em> held a campaign for Stuart to get his hat back. Soon after Stuart's eviction, Michelle bought him a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>Michelle and Stuart enjoyed a year long relationship, in which they attended showbiz parties and covered many articles in glossy magazines. Soon after the <a href="Big_Brother_UK_series_6" title="wikilink">sixth series</a> of <em>Big Brother</em> started, it was revealed these two had split up.</p>
<p>Stuarts time in the house was a quiet one, he didn't speak much (other than to Michelle). This was reflected in his votes, he was not nominated once during his time in the house but in the final he received the least number of votes (votes to win), no one liked him, no one disliked him. His eviction was a surprise, days before the final Big Brother asked him into the diary room and told him to leave the house</p>
<h3 id="vanessa-nimmo">Vanessa Nimmo</h3>
<p>Vanessa Nimmo (born <a href="12_August" title="wikilink">12 August</a> <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>) is a former double South African archery champion. She was born in <a href="Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Cape Town</a> but moved to <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> in 1994. After being on Big Brother, she dated <a href="Ben_Fogle" title="wikilink">Ben Fogle</a> for a few months.<a href="http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/article/0,,50001-1167235,00.html">1</a> During &quot;Fight Night&quot;, it took half of the housemates to hold Nadia back after Vanessa had supposedly slapped her. Like Michelle Bass, Vanessa also had breast implants which prompted her to do raunchy photo shoots with fellow housemate Shell Jubin.</p>
<h3 id="victor-ebuwa">Victor Ebuwa</h3>
<p>Victor Ebuwa (born <a href="January_17" title="wikilink">January 17</a>, <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a>), from <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, was the co-Leader of the 'Jungle Cats', styling himself as 'Slick (Vic)' in the house, and formed a close partnership with Jason Cowan, and also with Ahmed Aghil. He was known for his memorable <a href="one-liner" title="wikilink">one-liners</a> and <a href="rapping" title="wikilink">rap</a>/<a href="-izzle" class="uri" title="wikilink">-izzle</a>-style speech, for speaking his mind and having a game plan. He is also probably the first housemate ever to openly discuss his plan in the Diary Room in the house.</p>
<p>On day 57 he was evicted following an argument with fellow housemate Shell Jubin, after which a fan of Victor's sent death threats to Shell's parents house. Previous to this argument Victor was second favourite to win the show.</p>
<p>Many TV critics, including Ally Ross (<em><a href="The_Sun_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> TV Critic), have credited Victor for saving the <em>Big Brother</em> UK franchise, thanks to stirring controversy and his 'straight talking' attitude towards housemates. The previous year's show was slammed by critics for being dull, leading to record low viewing figures and a subsequent drop in eviction votes. Viewing figures increased this year to an average of 7 million every night.</p>
<p>Since leaving the house, Victor has appeared on <a href="Celebrity_Poker_Club" title="wikilink">Celebrity Poker Club</a> as well as various other channel 4 shows.</p>
<h2 id="chronology">Chronology</h2>
<p>Trailed as &quot;Big Brother turns evil&quot;, it was controversial from the start. The house was smaller and more claustrophobic; there was one bedroom; and the prize money of &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 was reduced if housemates failed their tasks. Big Brother promised tougher challenges as well as surprises to test the minds of housemates. The makers were initially criticised for choosing contestants specifically to boost ratings, opting for people that were openly gay (Marco, Dan and Kitten), a <a href="transsexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">transsexual</a> (<a href="Nadia_Almada" title="wikilink">Nadia</a>), a former <a href="asylum_seeker" title="wikilink">asylum seeker</a> (Ahmed), and a person who claimed to be bisexual (Jason, although he later revealed that this had been a fabrication to improve his chances of being selected). This feeling soon dissipated to a large extent as the personalities of the housemates overshadowed these issues.</p>
<h3 id="week-1">Week 1</h3>
<p>The housemates were all strong, opinionated characters. On Day 2, the housemates was to decide who was least deserving of their suitcase; they chose Kitten. On Day 5, the rebellious housemates decided to move the refrigerator the bedroom, but the housemates (especially Kitten) were disciplined for their actions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, some housemates such as Victor, did not respond well to the task. On Day 6, Emma and Kitten discovered a room; this turned out to be the Big Brother Bedsit.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> On Day 8, Kitten was ejected in the first week for constant rule-breaking. In Big Brother's first example of evil towards the housemates during the programme, &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 was deducted for every minute Kitten remained in the house. Therefore, there was no eviction in Week 1. At the end of Week 1, the housemates had &lt;U+00A3&gt;91,000 left in the prize fund.</p>
<h3 id="week-2">Week 2</h3>
<p>Another task was introduced, which could have potentially made the housemates lose &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000, involved Stuart's knowledge and Jason's strength. Stuart was required to answer general knowledge questions in the Diary Room while Jason had to spin a turntable on which the rest of the housemates sat. The housemates lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000 during the task. In an interesting twist, Big Brother decided that Ahmend has not abided by the task rules and therefore another &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 was lost. At this point, the total was &lt;U+00A3&gt;85,000. On Day 10, the housemates were told of the first week-long task: Big Brother Food to Go, a 24/7 fast food challenge. The housemates failed the task. A fake eviction on Day 15 saw two of the housemates, Emma and Michelle, confined to the nearby &quot;Big Brother <a href="Bedsit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedsit</a>&quot; where they could see and hear what was happening in the house without the others knowing. This was originally supposed to happen on Day 8, but Kitten's eviction postponed it.</p>
<h3 id="week-3">Week 3</h3>
<p>After Emma and Michelle's return to the house, scenes of aggression and violence erupted resulting in on-site security staff having to enter the house for the first time in the show's history. Some viewers of the live feed also called the police; after a short investigation, a joint statement by Hertfordshire <a href="British_Police" title="wikilink">police</a> and producers Endemol said that they were satisfied with steps being taken to ensure housemates' safety and well-being. Police were also reportedly questioning each contestant as they left the house. Emma was moved back to the bed-sit and later evicted permanently. Several remaining housemates (Victor, Jason, Nadia, Vanessa, Marco) were given a formal warning. A psychologist on the show resigned, claiming that his warnings that Endemol's deliberate selection of housemates likely to cause conflict would lead to the fight went unheeded. Although the fight was quite destructive, almost seven million people watched the daily highlight show including the fight.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The eviction originally planned on Day 22 was held off until Day 29.</p>
<p>Following the fight the arguments continued, but nothing on the scale of what producers refer to as &quot;Day 20&quot; or &quot;Fight Night&quot;. Following an appearance on <a href="MTV_UK" title="wikilink">MTV</a>'s <em><a href="Total_Request_Live" title="wikilink">Total Request Live</a></em> Emma and Victor clashed again and had to be separated by the security on the show.</p>
<h3 id="week-4">Week 4</h3>
<p>As a result of the fighting on Day 20, Emma was ejected from the Big Brother House on Day 23. The housemates were given a paper-mach&lt;U+00E9&gt; task on Day 25, which was to create a unique housemate sculpture. The sculpture was later torn down my Ahmed. On Day 29, Vanessa was evicted. It was also revealed that the live task show would be dropped from the television schedule so that another daily highlight show could be watched in its place.</p>
<h3 id="week-5">Week 5</h3>
<p>On Day 30, Big Brother gave the housemates another task that risked their prize fund. Before the challenge started, the housemates had &lt;U+00A3&gt;77,000, having lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;23,000 during their stay so far. Their task dealt with unscrambling the other housemates and resisting an electric shock. The contestants lost a total of &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000 in the task, lowering the maximum prize to &lt;U+00A3&gt;74,000.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Since the rules stipulate that a replacement housemate may be added in lieu of a walkout or ejection, a surprise new housemate, Becki Seddiki, entered the house on Day 31 as Emma's replacement. She was immediately given a task by Big Brother to (based on first impressions) kiss one of the housemates and that housemate would be up for eviction. This became known as the &quot;<a href="Judas_Iscariot" title="wikilink">Judas</a> kiss&quot;. She chose popular housemate Michelle, leading to her being perceived by many as a traitor, and her fate was sealed. Marco was evicted on Day 36.</p>
<h3 id="week-6">Week 6</h3>
<p>On Day 40, a major row broke out between Michelle and Becki when Michelle saw a plane flying over the garden with the message, &quot;The Sun - Only Becki nominated Michelle.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On Day 42, the housemates participated in a silent protest against Big Brother. Michelle decided to steal the Diary Room camera and attempted to incinerate it using a match. Because the camera base is fireproof, this did not work. As punishment for this, Michelle was given her &quot;first and final warning&quot; and Big Brother burnt Stuart's cowboy hat, as Stuart sat behind the sofa in horror. Becki was evicted on Day 43 because of her unpopularity by kissing Michelle and therefore nominating her.</p>
<h3 id="week-7">Week 7</h3>
<p>Big Brother gave the housemates a boot camp task. Jason and Michelle were selected as sargeants while the rest of the housemates were privates. In the Diary Room, Jason and Michelle were told that if the privates passed the task, then they would be up for eviction, and if the privates failed the task, then the two sargeants would be nominated. The privates passed, and all six were automatically nominated for eviction. On Day 48, the housemates participated in a dating service. Ahmed badly upset Michelle during the boot camp task and this was not well received by the public; he was evicted on Day 50.</p>
<h3 id="week-8">Week 8</h3>
<p>The following week the flamboyant, aggressive Victor Ebuwa was evicted in a shock result that was mainly a result of a fight with Shell Jubin during a Wedding Day task. This task was also the scene for one of the most embarrassing Big Brother moments of recent times as wannabe-singer and chorister for the day, Michelle Bass, ad-libbed her way through the classical <em>Pie Jesu</em>. The housemates failed the task. Victor was evicted on Day 57.</p>
<h3 id="week-9">Week 9</h3>
<p>The following week Michelle was evicted. The series was notable for her romance with Stuart Wilson. It is widely believed that they were the first couple to have full penetrative sex on the main <em>Big Brother</em> UK show (this having already taken place on <em>Teen Big Brother</em> in 2003), following two incidents where they made a crude tent under the dining table and discarded their microphones. However their actions were not visible, and both parties have refused to confirm or deny it. Michelle's self-confessed jealous behaviour gave some viewers the impression that Stuart was an unwilling participant in the affair, but he has stated since that this was not the case. The relationship continued after both had left the house. They have since split up.</p>
<h3 id="week-10">Week 10</h3>
<p>Two days before the final day Stuart Wilson received only 7% of the votes to win, the lowest amount of the contestants in the house, and so was evicted in a surprise move mid-way through a party. He was told he was to leave immediately, without saying goodbye to the remaining housemates. He received a rapturous reception upon leaving the Big Brother house.</p>
<p>Nadia, as expected by all the <a href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmakers</a> (she was favourite for six weeks) won Big Brother (UK) 2004 with 74% of the vote. She was greeted by an adoring crowd who chanted her name.</p>
<p>BB5 was also notable for the introduction by two of the housemates of the 'eviction pose', which led to several evictees doing poses during <em><a href="Big_Brother_UK_series_6" title="wikilink">Big Brother 6</a></em>. First Victor struck a 'cool' pose in keeping with his house 'gangsta' persona, leaning against the wall sideways on to the waiting audience. Later Dan (who could possibly have seen Victor before the inner doors closed) stood, head bowed, arms out, before lifting his head.</p>
<p>Final vote breakdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nadia: 3,863,696</li>
<li>Jason: 1,335,246</li>
<li>Dan: 685,995</li>
<li>Shell: 347,051</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Total number of votes in the final week: 6.3 million</em></p>
<h2 id="prize-fund">Prize Fund</h2>
<p><img src="BB5UKPrizeFund.png" title="fig:The Big Brother 5 prize fund" alt="The Big Brother 5 prize fund" width="250" /> One of the central twists to Big Brother in 2004 was the fluctuating prize fund. Housemates could either win or lose money depending on how well they completed the task. As the winner, Nadia received &lt;U+00A3&gt;63,500, meaning that the housemates lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;36,500 during the 71 day run of the programme.</p>
<h3 id="week-1-1">Week 1</h3>
<p>The housemates lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;9,000 during week one. Kitten was ejected from the Big Brother house, but she refused to leave. Big Brother decided to drop &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 from the prize fund for every minute that Kitten remained in the house. She stayed inside the house for nine minutes and the housemates lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;9,000. At the end of week one, the prize was &lt;U+00A3&gt;91,000.</p>
<h3 id="week-2-1">Week 2</h3>
<p>During the weekly task, the housemates lost &lt;U+00A3&gt;6,000. The total after week two was &lt;U+00A3&gt;85,000.</p>
<h2 id="jungle-cats">Jungle Cats</h2>
<p><strong>Jungle Cats</strong>, also referred to as the JCs, were the clique that were prominent in the reality show <a href="Big_Brother_UK_series_5" title="wikilink">Big Brother UK series 5</a>. The group consisted of a trio who were Ahmed Aghil, Jason Cowan and Victor Ebuwa. Stuart Wilson was also initially part of the Jungle Cats, yet became more of a jungle kitten than a jungle cat as his relationship with Michelle Bass developed whilst in the house. They earned a loyal fan base of around 1.2 million of the average 7 million who watched the series. They were seen as the masculine peoples favourite clique as opposed to the feminine peoples clique represented by the Jungle Cats rivals the Lip Gloss Bitches who were founded by <a href="Marco_Sabba" title="wikilink">Marco Sabba</a>. In the show Ahmed Aghil lasted 7 Weeks followed by <a href="Victor_Ebuwa" title="wikilink">Victor Ebuwa</a> who lasted 8 weeks. <a href="Jason_Cowan" title="wikilink">Jason Cowan</a> the founder of the Jungle Cats finished the show as Runner up in a programme seen by the JCS and by leading TV critic Ally Ross , of the sun as biased in favour of <a href="Nadia_Almada" title="wikilink">Nadia Almada</a> who eventually won the show.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>In week 1, housemates had to nominate who they didn't want to receive their suitcase, not who they wanted to evict. Kitten refused to nominate. Kitten was ejected after constant rule breaking.</p>

<p>This week, housemates were told there was a double eviction, and the two housemates to be evicted were Emma and Michelle. In actuality, the public had been voting which two housemates enter a secret Big Brother Bedsit, in which the two evictees would live for five days, and be able to watch their fellow housemates on a television screen, and then return to the house, still able to win the prize money.</p>

<p>Emma and Michelle made their nominations from the Bedsit. The other housemates could not nominate them, assuming them to be evicted.</p>

<p>Due to Emma&lt;U+2019&gt;s ejection from the house, Week Three&lt;U+2019&gt;s eviction was postponed until Week Four.</p>

<p>In Week Five, new housemate Becki arrived. She could not be nominated, and believed she could not nominate. However, Big Brother told her that she must nominate one housemate who will automatically face eviction by kissing them. If she didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t do this, she would be up for eviction. Becki kissed Michelle, meaning she was up against the two housemates with the most nominations, Marco and Nadia.</p>

<p>Jason and Victor were banned from nominating due to constant discussion of nominations</p>

<p>In the housemates army task, sergeants Jason and Michelle were told of the twist in nominations. If the privates passed the task, all six privates would face eviction. If the privates failed, sergeants would face eviction. Privates passed, meaning the six of them faced eviction.</p>

<p>All housemates faced eviction automatically.</p>

<p>There were no nominations in the final week. With five housemates remaining, the housemate with the least public votes to win would be evicted in a surprise eviction during a party. Stuart was this housemate, leaving Dan, Jason, Nadia and Shell in the final four.</p>
