During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> he led RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation, with responsibility for the defence of Australia and air offensives against <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> targets in the <a href="South_West_Pacific_theatre_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">South West Pacific Area</a>.

<p>A veteran of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Bostock first saw combat as a soldier in the <a href="Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> at <a href="Gallipoli_Campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a>, then as a pilot in the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>, where he won the <a href="Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgian</a> <a href="Croix_de_guerre" title="wikilink">Croix de guerre</a>. He joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921 and by 1941 had risen to become its third most senior officer, serving as Director of Training from 1930 to 1931, <a href="Commanding_Officer" title="wikilink">Commanding Officer</a> of <a href="No._3_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 3 Squadron</a> from 1931 to 1936, and Director of Operations and Intelligence from 1938 to 1939.</p>
<p>The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1942 but was passed over in favour of <a href="Air_Commodore" title="wikilink">Air Commodore</a> <a href="George_Jones_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">George Jones</a>, a friend of twenty years. Appointed <a href="Air_Officer_Commanding" title="wikilink">Air Officer Commanding</a> RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones over control of the Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a <a href="journalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalist</a> and later a Federal <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a>.</p>

Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy had the authority to act in place of the <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) if required.

<p>In August 1942, <a href="General_(United_States)" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a>, Supreme Commander SWPA, replaced Lieutenant General Brett with <a href="Major_general_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Major General</a> (later General) <a href="George_Kenney" title="wikilink">George Kenney</a>.

<p>By the end of 1943, 9OG, originally the RAAF's mobile strike force, had become engaged in static garrison duties in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, which led to the establishment of No. 10 Operational Group (10OG) on 13 November 1943 at <a href="Lae_Nadzab_Airport" title="wikilink">Nadzab</a>, under the command of Group Captain <a href="Frederick_Scherger" title="wikilink">Frederick Scherger</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of 9OG, as well as responsibility for the <a href="Port_Moresby" title="wikilink">Port Moresby</a> and <a href="Milne_Bay" title="wikilink">Milne Bay</a> sectors. Bostock again recommended changing 9OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing 10OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from the infusion of new squadrons. On 11 April, 9OG became Northern Command.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> On 14 September 1944, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred with Curtin; the Prime Minister meanwhile authorised changing 10OG's name to <a href="Australian_First_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">First Tactical Air Force</a>, with effect from 25 October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Bostock had control of the USAAF Fifth and <a href="Thirteenth_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Thirteenth Air Forces</a>, as well as 1TAF, during <a href="Battle_of_Tarakan_(1945)" title="wikilink">Operation Oboe One</a>, the invasion of <a href="Tarakan_Island" title="wikilink">Tarakan</a>, commencing 1 May 1945.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17,000 personnel.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> On <a href="Operation_Oboe_Six" title="wikilink">Operation Oboe Six</a>, the invasion of <a href="Labuan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Labuan</a>-<a href="Brunei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brunei</a> in June, Bostock also had at his disposal aircraft based in Australia at Western and North-Western Area Commands.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> For <a href="Battle_of_Balikpapan_(1945)" title="wikilink">Operation Oboe Two</a>, the invasion of Balikpapan in July, Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons.

Together with a naval barrage, this resulted in a &quot;scene of indescribable ruin&quot; on the battlefield, and allowed seventeen waves of troops to disembark their landing craft without loss.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive &quot;flawless&quot;,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> while <a href="Thomas_Blamey" title="wikilink">General Sir Thomas Blamey</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Australian_Military_Forces" title="wikilink">Australian Military Forces</a>, congratulated Bostock on his &quot;high order of control&quot; and &quot;ready and full cooperation&quot; throughout the Borneo campaign.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rivalry-with-george-jones">Rivalry with George Jones</h3>
<p><embed src="Jones-Bostock-Burnett_AWM_012249.jpg&lt;U+200E&gt;" title="fig:Bostock (centre) with newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones (left), and former CAS, Air Chief Marshal Burnett, in 1942" /> From 1942, the structure of the RAAF was divided such that Bostock was in operational charge of the Air Force in the South West Pacific but relied on <a href="George_Jones_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Air Vice Marshal Jones</a> as CAS for supplies of manpower and equipment, while Jones was nominally in command of the entire RAAF but played no part in directing its major air operations against Japan.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The situation was a source of &quot;acute personal tension&quot; between the two senior officers for the remainder of the war.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It was exacerbated by the fact that while the CAS was <em><a href="de_jure" title="wikilink">de jure</a></em> head of the RAAF, Jones' rank of Air Vice Marshal was no higher than Bostock's. Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens later commented: &quot;The system of divided command... was not an ideal arrangement, but with men of goodwill it could have worked. Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind...&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Bostock's relationship with Kenney permitted him to ignore operational requests from Jones,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> while Jones continued to assert administrative control over Bostock&lt;U+2019&gt;s command.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> When Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command in April 1943 and replace him with Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, AOC of No. 9 Operational Group, Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command. Kenney threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government, and some time later MacArthur told Curtin that Hewitt &quot;was not an adequate replacement&quot; for Bostock.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The matter was allowed to drop,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> but the rivalry continued. In January 1945, an acrimonious series of cables was exchanged between the two Air Vice Marshals. Jones complained to Bostock of the latter's &quot;insubordinate tone&quot; and &quot;repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters&quot;. Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was &quot;responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you&lt;U+201D&gt;, and that he would &quot;continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>Their feud was blamed for contributing to the low morale that precipitated the so-called &quot;<a href="Morotai_Mutiny" title="wikilink">Morotai Mutiny</a>&quot; of April 1945, when a group of senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Alerted to the issue by 1TAF's commander, Air Commodore <a href="Arthur_Henry_Cobby" title="wikilink">Harry Cobby</a>, Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations. His methods were construed as an attempt to &quot;make the situation go away or to at least cover it up&quot;; one of the &quot;mutineers&quot;, Squadron Leader John Waddy, quoted Bostock as saying, &quot;I will leave these applications on the table and if you pick them up, all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> When the pilots refused to drop the matter, Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale on the island to be at a &quot;dangerously low level&quot; and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore <a href="Frederick_Scherger" title="wikilink">Frederick Scherger</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Kenney concurred with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock: &quot;I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The conflict between the commanders reached its nadir during the <a href="Battle_of_Tarakan_(1945)" title="wikilink">invasion of Tarakan</a> in May 1945, when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a U.S. warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully &quot;fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck&quot; when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The duel system of control and the tension between its two senior officers not only helped confuse the RAAF's efforts in the field but also reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>Bostock went into journalism after his retirement from the military, and become an aviation correspondent for <em>The Herald</em>. He wrote a series of articles criticising the Air Force's organisation and presenting his side of the story of RAAF Command, motivated partly by his belief that the <a href="Australia_in_the_War_of_1939&lt;U+2013&gt;1945" title="wikilink">official history of Australia in World War II</a> would fail to adequately cover it. The articles caused considerable controversy and prompted the Minister for Air, <a href="Arthur_Drakeford" title="wikilink">Arthur Drakeford</a>, to make a formal response in Federal Parliament, labelling Bostock's allegations &quot;malicious and unjustified&quot;.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Bostock was decorated twice in 1948 for his war service, in March with the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> &quot;in recognition of distinguished services whilst in command of air operations in the Borneo Campaign during the period March to September, 1945&quot;,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> and in April with the American <a href="Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" title="wikilink">Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He entered politics in 1949, standing as a <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> candidate for the Federal <a href="Division_of_Indi" title="wikilink">Division of Indi</a> in <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. Elected to the <a href="Australian_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>, he retained his seat until being defeated in the 1958 poll. Bostock served on a joint committee for foreign affairs and sometimes came into conflict with his own party on matters of defence policy. He continued to contribute to <em>The Herald</em> while in government.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> During parliamentary debates in 1951 and again in 1957, Bostock spoke for &quot;an integrated defence force with a single minister&quot;, advocating amalgamation of the four separate Departments of Defence, Air, Navy and Army into one Department of Defence, headed by the Minister for Defence. He further proposed that a single Commander-in-Chief lead the Army, Navy and Air Force, with the <a href="Chief_of_Army_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a>, the <a href="Chief_of_Navy_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Naval Staff</a>, and the <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a> reporting directly to the new position.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In 1973 the single-service departments were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing <a href="Department_of_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Department of Defence</a>, and by 1984 a <a href="Chief_of_the_Defence_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Defence Force</a> position had evolved to directly command all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Bostock's wife Gwendolen died in 1947, and he married 33-year-old Nanette O'Keefe in Melbourne on 1 June 1951; they had three sons. He owned a property near <a href="Benalla,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Benalla</a>, in rural Victoria, where he died in 1968. Survived by his second wife and his five children, Bostock was accorded an Air Force funeral and cremated.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
