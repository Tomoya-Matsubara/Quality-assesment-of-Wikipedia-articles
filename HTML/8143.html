<p><strong><em>Yes Minister</em></strong> is a <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirical</a> <a href="British_sitcom" title="wikilink">British sitcom</a> written by Sir <a href="Antony_Jay" title="wikilink">Antony Jay</a> and <a href="Jonathan_Lynn" title="wikilink">Jonathan Lynn</a> that was first transmitted by <a href="BBC_television" title="wikilink">BBC television</a> and <a href="BBC_Radio" title="wikilink">radio</a> between 1980 and 1984, split over three seven-episode series. The sequel, <strong><em>Yes, Prime Minister</em></strong>, ran from 1986 to 1988. In total there were 38 episodes&lt;U+2014&gt;of which all but one lasted half an hour.</p>
<p>Set principally in the private office of a British government cabinet minister in the (fictional) Department for Administrative Affairs in <a href="Whitehall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitehall</a> (the sequel was set in the Prime Minister's offices at <a href="10_Downing_Street" title="wikilink">10 Downing Street</a>), the series follows the <a href="Minister_(government)" title="wikilink">senior ministerial</a> career of The Rt Hon. <a href="Jim_Hacker" title="wikilink">Jim Hacker</a> <a href="Member_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">MP</a>, played by <a href="Paul_Eddington" title="wikilink">Paul Eddington</a>. His various struggles to formulate and enact legislation or effect departmental changes are opposed by the will of the <a href="British_Civil_Service" title="wikilink">British Civil Service</a>, in particular his <a href="Permanent_Secretary" title="wikilink">Permanent Secretary</a> (head of each government department's bureaucrats), Sir <a href="Humphrey_Appleby" title="wikilink">Humphrey Appleby</a>, played by <a href="Nigel_Hawthorne" title="wikilink">Nigel Hawthorne</a>. His <a href="Principal_Private_Secretary" title="wikilink">Principal Private Secretary</a> <a href="Bernard_Woolley" title="wikilink">Bernard Woolley</a>, played by <a href="Derek_Fowlds" title="wikilink">Derek Fowlds</a>, is usually caught between the two. Almost every episode ends with the line &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; (or &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;), uttered (usually) by Sir Humphrey as he relishes his victory over his &quot;political master&quot; or acknowledges defeat.</p>
<p>A huge critical and popular success, the series received a number of awards, including several <a href="British_Academy_Television_Awards" title="wikilink">BAFTAs</a> and in 2004 came sixth in the <em><a href="Britain&#39;s_Best_Sitcom" title="wikilink">Britain's Best Sitcom</a></em> poll. It was the favourite television programme of the then <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="situation">Situation</h2>
<p>As the series commences, a general election has just been held, and the party of which <a href="Jim_Hacker" title="wikilink">Jim Hacker</a> MP is a prominent member is elected to power after some time in opposition. The Prime Minister offers Hacker the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs, which he accepts. Hacker goes to his department and meets his Permanent Secretary, Sir <a href="Humphrey_Appleby" title="wikilink">Humphrey Appleby</a>, and his Principal Private Secretary, <a href="Bernard_Woolley" title="wikilink">Bernard Woolley</a>. While Appleby is outwardly <a href="Sycophant" title="wikilink">obsequious</a> towards the new minister, he is prepared to defend the <em>status quo</em> at all costs. Woolley is sympathetic towards Hacker, but, as Appleby reminds him, his civil servant superiors will have much to say about the course of his future career, and the minister may be gone at any time. Many of the episodes revolve around proposals backed by Hacker, but frustrated by Appleby, or promoted by Appleby, who does whatever is necessary to persuade Hacker that the policy should go into force.</p>
<p>As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government, most of the scenes take place in private locations, such as offices and exclusive members' club lounges. Lynn says &quot;there was not a single scene set in the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> because... government does not take place in the House of Commons; some politics... and much theatre takes place there. Government happens in private. As in all public performances, the real work is done in rehearsal, behind closed doors. Then the public, and the House, are shown what the government wishes them to see.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The different ideals and self-interested motives of the characters are frequently contrasted. Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things, he ultimately sees his re-election, and elevation to higher office as the only measures of his success. Accordingly, he must appear to the voters to be effective and responsive to the public will. To his party (and, in the first incarnation, the Prime Minister) he must act as a loyal and effective party member. Sir Humphrey, on the other hand, genuinely believes that it is the Civil Service that knows what is best for the country (a belief shared by his bureaucratic colleagues) which is usually what is best for the Civil Service. Most of Sir Humphrey's actions are motivated by his wish to maintain the prestige, power, and influence he enjoys inside a large, bureaucratic organisation, and also to preserve the numerous perks of his position: automatic honours, a substantial income, a fixed retirement age and a large <a href="indexation" title="wikilink">index-linked</a> pension, and the practical impossibility of being made redundant or being sacked. In fact, a good deal of the tension in their relationship comes from Hacker's awareness that it is the politicians who are liable to lose <em>their</em> jobs if civil service ineptitude comes to public attention.</p>

<p>Hacker, then, sees his task as the initiation of departmental reforms and economies, a reduction of the level of <a href="bureaucracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bureaucracy</a> and staff numbers in the Civil Service, and the government of the country according to his party's policies. To do so, or to at least look as if he has, would be a vote-winner. Conversely, Sir Humphrey sees his role as ensuring that politics is kept out of government as much as possible, and that the <em><a href="status_quo" title="wikilink">status quo</a></em> is upheld as a matter of principle. He will block any move that seeks either to prevent the further expansion of the civil service or to reduce the complexity of its bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Much of the show's humour thus derives from the antagonism between <a href="Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Cabinet</a> ministers (who believe they are in charge) and the members of the British Civil Service who really run the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">country</a>. A typical episode centres on Jim Hacker's suggesting and pursuing a reform, and Sir Humphrey's ingenious blocking of all Hacker's lines of approach. More often than not Sir Humphrey prevents him from achieving his goal, while mollifying Hacker with some positive publicity, or at least a means to cover up his failure. Occasionally, however, Hacker <em>does</em> get his way, as he does in &quot;<a href="The_Greasy_Pole" title="wikilink">The Greasy Pole</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="A_Victory_for_Democracy" title="wikilink">A Victory for Democracy</a>&quot;. Sir Humphrey occasionally resorts to tactics such as calling a policy &quot;courageous&quot;; he and Hacker both know that, in Sir Humphrey's view, a controversial policy will lose votes, a courageous one will lose the election.</p>
<p>Initially, Woolley na&lt;U+00EF&gt;vely sees his job as the disinterested implementation of the Minister's policies, but he gradually finds that this conflicts with his institutional duty to the department and, sometimes (since Sir Humphrey is responsible for formally assessing Woolley's performance), his own potential career development.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Consequently, another recurring scenario is one where Bernard must &quot;walk the tightrope&quot;&lt;U+2013&gt;that is, arbitrate between his two conflicting duties by resorting to elaborate verbosity (much like Sir Humphrey) to avoid explicitly choosing one over the other.</p>
<p>The first series featured Frank Weisel, Hacker's political adviser, played by <a href="Neil_Fitzwiliam" title="wikilink">Neil Fitzwiliam</a>. While his name is pronounced W-&quot;eye&quot;-sel, Sir Humphrey and Bernard persistently call him &quot;Mr Weasel&quot;. Weisel does not appear after the first series, following his convenient acceptance of a position on a <a href="quango" class="uri" title="wikilink">quango</a> (Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation) tasked, appropriately, with investigating the appointment of other quangos and the government's honours system and 'jobs for the boys'.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After the third series, following Sir Humphrey's promotion to <a href="Cabinet_Secretary" title="wikilink">Cabinet Secretary</a>, Hacker becomes Prime Minister and requests that Bernard Woolley continue as his Principal Private Secretary. The first series of <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> introduced Dorothy Wainwright (played by <a href="Deborah_Norton" title="wikilink">Deborah Norton</a>) as a highly able Special Political Adviser to the Prime Minister. Her experience and insight into many civil service tricks ensures a lasting mutual distrust between her and Sir Humphrey (he once refers to her as &quot;the Wainwright female&quot; and &quot;dear lady&quot;) and an invaluable second opinion for Hacker.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Hacker's home life is shown occasionally throughout the series. His wife, Annie (<a href="Diana_Hoddinott" title="wikilink">Diana Hoddinott</a>), is clearly frustrated by the disruptions caused by her husband's political career and is at times somewhat cynical about her husband's politics. Meanwhile, his sociology student daughter, Lucy (<a href="Gerry_Cowper" title="wikilink">Gerry Cowper</a>), becomes an environmental activist in one episode (her only on-screen appearance, despite several other mentions), campaigning against the Department's intention to remove protected status from a wooded area believed to be inhabited by badgers. Sir Humphrey falsely assures her there have not been badgers in the woods for some years, a deceit winked at by Hacker.</p>
<p>Sir Humphrey's personal characteristics include his <a href="Logorrhoea" title="wikilink">complicated sentences</a>, his ineffable snobbery, his cynical views on government, and his superciliousness. Hacker's attributes include occasional indecisiveness, and a tendency to launch into ludicrous <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Churchillian</a> speeches. Bernard is apt to linguistic pedantry. Sir Humphrey often discusses matters with other Permanent Secretaries, who appear similarly sardonic and jaded, and the Cabinet Secretary (whom he will eventually succeed in <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>), Sir Arnold Robinson (<a href="John_Nettleton_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Nettleton</a>), an archetype of cynicism, haughtiness and conspiratorial expertise. This fairly counter-intuitive view of government administration is not only Sir Humphrey's: it is completely taken for granted by the civil service.</p>
<p>The <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> episode &quot;<a href="The_Bishop&#39;s_Gambit" title="wikilink">The Bishop's Gambit</a>&quot; parodied <a href="Liberal_Christianity" title="wikilink">liberal theology</a> and politics in the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>. Hacker thought that the church is a Christian institution, but Sir Humphrey gleefully informed him that most of the <a href="bishop" title="wikilink">bishops</a> do not believe in <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a>, and that a <a href="theologian" class="uri" title="wikilink">theologian</a>'s job is partly to explain why an <a href="agnostic" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnostic</a> or <a href="atheist" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheist</a> can be a church leader.</p>
<p>Almost all the episodes end with one of the characters (usually Sir Humphrey) saying &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; or &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; accordingly. Each episode of the former was more or less self-contained, but the first series of <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> had a loose <a href="story_arc" title="wikilink">story arc</a> relating to Hacker's attempts to reform the United Kingdom's armed forces, while the second was mostly devoted to concluding storylines and character arcs that had been seen over the course of the show.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>Lynn joined the <a href="Cambridge_Union_Society" title="wikilink">Cambridge Union</a> in his first year at the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a> because he thought that he might like to enter politics. &quot;All of the main debaters there, aged twenty, were the most pompous, self-satisfied, self-important bunch of clowns that I've ever clapped eyes on. They were all behaving as if they were on the government front bench, and twenty years later they all were: <a href="Michael_Howard" title="wikilink">Michael Howard</a>; <a href="John_Selwyn_Gummer" title="wikilink">John Selwyn Gummer</a>; <a href="Kenneth_Clarke" title="wikilink">Kenneth Clarke</a>. I thought at that point that the only way that I could ever contribute to politics is making fun of the politicians.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The series, then, intended to satirise politics and government in general, rather than any specific party. The writers placed Hacker at the centre of the political spectrum, and were careful to identify his party headquarters as &quot;Central House&quot; (a combination of <a href="Conservative_Central_Office" title="wikilink">Conservative Central Office</a> and Labour's <a href="Transport_House" title="wikilink">Transport House</a>). The terms &quot;<a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a>&quot; are scrupulously avoided throughout the series, favouring terms such as &quot;the party&quot; or &quot;the Government&quot; and &quot;the opposition.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the first scene of the first episode, &quot;<a href="Open_Government_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">Open Government</a>&quot;, Hacker is shown at the declaration of his constituency result wearing a white <a href="Rosette_(decoration)" title="wikilink">rosette</a>, with other candidates sporting the red and blue rosettes associated with the two leading British parties. The one exception to this neutrality occurs very briefly in &quot;<a href="The_National_Education_Service" title="wikilink">The National Education Service</a>&quot;, when Sir Humphrey explains to Bernard how the policy of <a href="comprehensive_school" title="wikilink">comprehensive education</a> is retained through successive governments, using different arguments according to which party is in power. Even there, Humphrey does not reveal which party Jim Hacker represents. Despite this, the overall thrust was toward government reduction rather than expansion. The episode &quot;<a href="Jobs_for_the_Boys" title="wikilink">Jobs for the Boys</a>&quot;, for example, rejected <a href="corporatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">corporatism</a>. Through the first and second series of Yes Minister there were slight hints towards the centre-right newspapers, namely the <em><a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Daily Telegraph</a></em>, changing people's opinions and how popular they found the government. The hints suggested the presence of a centre-right government particularly associated with the Conservative Party, in which Sir Antony Jay was a long-standing member. Throughout the period of <em>Yes Minister</em> and <em>Yes Prime Minister</em> the incumbent government of the United Kingdom was Conservative with the government led by Mrs Thatcher.</p>
<p>In a 2004 documentary, <a href="Armando_Iannucci" title="wikilink">Armando Iannucci</a> compared <em>Yes Minister</em> to <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>'s <em><a href="Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="wikilink">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em> in how it has influenced the public's view of the state. Although Lynn comments that the word &quot;<a href="Spin_(public_relations)" title="wikilink">spin</a>&quot; has &quot;probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Iannucci suggests that the show &quot;taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the <a href="public_relations" title="wikilink">public relations</a> training they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from <a href="Teleprompter" title="wikilink">autocue</a> effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode &quot;<a href="The_Ministerial_Broadcast" title="wikilink">The Ministerial Broadcast</a>,&quot; in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode &quot;<a href="A_Conflict_of_Interest" title="wikilink">A Conflict of Interest</a>&quot; humorously lampoons the various political stances of Britain's newspapers through their readers.</p>

<p><a href="Adam_Curtis" title="wikilink">Adam Curtis</a>, in his three-part TV documentary <em><a href="The_Trap_(television_documentary_series)" title="wikilink">The Trap</a></em>, criticised the series as &quot;ideological propaganda for a political movement&quot;,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and claimed that <em>Yes Minister</em> is indicative of a larger movement of criticism of government and bureaucracy, centred upon <a href="public_choice" title="wikilink">public choice</a> economics. This view has been supported by Jay himself: </p>
<h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
<p>The writers were inspired by a variety of sources, including sources inside government, published material and contemporary news stories. The writers also met several leading senior civil servants under the auspices of the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_Public_Administration" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of Public Administration</a>, a <a href="think-tank" class="uri" title="wikilink">think-tank</a> for the public service sector, which led to the development of some plot lines. Some situations were conceived as fiction, but were later revealed to have real-life counterparts. The episode &quot;<a href="The_Compassionate_Society" title="wikilink">The Compassionate Society</a>&quot; depicts a hospital with five hundred administrative staff but no doctors, nurses or patients. Lynn recalls that &quot;after inventing this absurdity, we discovered there were six such hospitals (or very large empty wings of hospitals) exactly as we had described them in our episode.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In a programme screened by the BBC in early 2004, paying tribute to the series, it was revealed that Jay and Lynn had drawn on information provided by two insiders from the governments of <a href="Harold_Wilson" title="wikilink">Harold Wilson</a> and <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">James Callaghan</a>, namely <a href="Marcia_Matilda_Falkender,_Baroness_Falkender" title="wikilink">Marcia Williams</a> and <a href="Bernard_Donoughue,_Baron_Donoughue" title="wikilink">Bernard Donoughue</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The published diaries of <a href="Richard_Crossman" title="wikilink">Richard Crossman</a> also provided inspiration.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode entitled &quot;<a href="The_Moral_Dimension" title="wikilink">The Moral Dimension</a>&quot;, in which Hacker and his staff engage in the scheme of secretly consuming <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcohol</a> on a trade mission to the fictional <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> state of <a href="Qumran_(fictional_country)" title="wikilink">Qumran</a>, was based on a real incident that took place in <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, involving Callaghan and Donoughue, the latter of whom informed Jay and Lynn about the incident.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Jay says that &quot;I can't tell you where, I can't tell you when and I can't tell you who was involved; all I can tell you is that we knew that it had actually happened. That's why it was so funny. We couldn't think up things as funny as the real things that had happened.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Media historian Andrew Crisell suggests that the show was &quot;enriched by the viewers' suspicion that what they were watching was unhealthily close to real life.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Fusing inspiration and invention, Lynn and Jay worked on the story &quot;for anything from three days to two weeks,&quot; and only took &quot;four mornings to write all the dialogue. After we wrote the episode, we would show it to some secret sources, always including somebody who was an expert on the subject in question. They would usually give us extra information which, because it was true, was usually funnier than anything we might have thought up.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Designers Valerie Warrender and Gloria Clayton were given access to the Cabinet Rooms and the State Drawing Rooms. For security purposes, the arrangements of the rooms were altered, and the views from the windows were never shown, in order to conceal the layout of the buildings.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="main-characters">Main characters</h2>
<h3 id="james-jim-hacker">James &quot;Jim&quot; Hacker</h3>

<p><img src="Administrative_Affairs.jpg" title="fig:The three main characters in the Minister&#39;s Office of the Department of Administrative Affairs: from left, Sir Humphrey Appleby, Bernard Woolley and Jim Hacker." alt="The three main characters in the Minister&#39;s Office of the Department of Administrative Affairs: from left, Sir Humphrey Appleby, Bernard Woolley and Jim Hacker." /> <strong>Jim Hacker</strong> (<a href="Paul_Eddington" title="wikilink">Paul Eddington</a>) was the editor of a newspaper, <em>Reform</em>, before entering government. He apparently spent a good deal of time in Parliament on the Opposition benches before his party won the <a href="general_election" title="wikilink">general election</a>. In <em>Yes Minister</em> he is the Minister for Administrative Affairs (a fictitious ministry of the British government) and a Cabinet Minister, and in <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> he becomes the <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. Hacker received his degree from the <a href="London_School_of_Economics" title="wikilink">London School of Economics</a> (graduating with a Third), for which he is often derided by the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>-educated Sir Humphrey (who attended the fictitious Ballie College graduating with a First in Classics). His early character is that of a gung-ho, but na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve, politician, bringing sweeping changes to his department. Before long, Hacker begins to notice that Civil Service tactics are preventing his planned changes being put into practice. As he learns he becomes more sly and cynical, and uses some of the Civil Service ruses himself. While Sir Humphrey initially held all the aces, Hacker now and again plays a trump card of his own.</p>
<p>Throughout <em>Yes Minister</em> Hacker is regularly portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler who is incapable of making a firm decision, prone to make potentially embarrassing blunders, and a frequent target of criticism from the <a href="journalism" title="wikilink">press</a> and stern lectures from the <a href="Chief_Whip" title="wikilink">Chief Whip</a>. However, in <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> Hacker becomes more statesmanlike. He practises more grandiose speeches, dreams up his &quot;grand design&quot; and hones his diplomatic skills. Nearly all of these efforts land him in trouble. In a <em><a href="Radio_Times" title="wikilink">Radio Times</a></em> interview to promote <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, Paul Eddington stated, &quot;He's beginning to find his feet as a man of power, and he's begun to confound those who thought they'd be able to manipulate him out of hand.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sir-humphrey-appleby">Sir Humphrey Appleby</h3>

<p><strong>Sir Humphrey Appleby</strong> (Sir <a href="Nigel_Hawthorne" title="wikilink">Nigel Hawthorne</a>) serves throughout the series as <a href="Permanent_Secretary" title="wikilink">Permanent Secretary</a> under his Minister, Jim Hacker at the Department of Administrative Affairs. He is appointed Cabinet Secretary just as Hacker's party enters a leadership crisis, and is instrumental in Hacker's elevation to Prime Minister. He is committed to maintaining the <em><a href="status_quo" title="wikilink">status quo</a></em> for the country in general and for the <a href="British_Civil_Service" title="wikilink">Civil Service</a> in particular.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Sir Humphrey is a master of <a href="obfuscation" class="uri" title="wikilink">obfuscation</a> and <a href="Social_influence" title="wikilink">manipulation</a>, baffling his opponents with technical jargon and circumlocutions, strategically appointing allies to supposedly impartial boards, and setting up interdepartmental committees to smother his <a href="political_minister" title="wikilink">Minister's</a> proposals in <a href="red_tape" title="wikilink">red tape</a>. In <em>Britain's Best Sitcom</em>, <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a> comments that &quot;we love the idea of the coherence and articulacy of Sir Humphrey... it's one of the things you look forward to in an episode of <em>Yes Minister</em>... when's the big speech going to happen? And can I see if he's reading it from an <a href="idiot_board" title="wikilink">idiot board</a>... he's really learned it, and it's superb.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Derek Fowlds posited to a concerned Eddington that these speeches were the reason why Hawthorne won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance four times in a row, while Eddington, though nominated, didn't win at all.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Loquacious and verbose, he frequently uses both his mastery of the English language and even his superb grasp of <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> and Greek grammar both to perplex his political master and to obscure the relevant issues. In a <em><a href="Radio_Times" title="wikilink">Radio Times</a></em> interview to promote the second series of <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, producer Sydney Lotterby stated that he always tried to give Eddington and Hawthorne extra time to rehearse as their scenes invariably featured lengthy dialogue exchanges.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bernard-woolley">Bernard Woolley</h3>

<p><strong>Bernard Woolley</strong> (<a href="Derek_Fowlds" title="wikilink">Derek Fowlds</a>) is Jim Hacker's <a href="Principal_Private_Secretary" title="wikilink">Principal Private Secretary</a>. His loyalties are therefore split between his Minister and his Civil Service boss, Sir Humphrey: while he is theoretically responsible to Hacker personally, it is Sir Humphrey who writes his performance reviews and influences Bernard's Civil Service career. This leads to difficult situations for the young civil servant. He usually handles these situations well, and maintains his reputation in the Civil Service as a &quot;high flier&quot; (as opposed to a &quot;low flier supported by occasional gusts of wind&quot;).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Woolley is always quick to point out the physical impossibilities of Sir Humphrey's or Hacker's <a href="mixed_metaphor" title="wikilink">mixed metaphors</a>, with almost obsessive <a href="pedant" title="wikilink">pedantry</a>. He can occasionally appear rather childlike, by making animal noises and gestures or by acting out how such an analogy cannot work, which sometimes annoys his Minister.</p>
<p>Woolley tends to side with Hacker when new policies are announced, because they seem radical or democratic, only for Sir Humphrey to point out the disadvantages to the <a href="status_quo" title="wikilink">status quo</a> and the civil service in particular. To sway Bernard, Sir Humphrey uses phrases such as &quot;barbarism&quot; and &quot;the beginning of the end&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At times when Sir Humphrey fails to get his way, Woolley can be seen smiling smugly at him over his defeat.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In a 2004 retrospective, <a href="Armando_Iannucci" title="wikilink">Armando Iannucci</a> commented that Fowlds had a difficult task because he had to &quot;spend most of his time saying nothing but looking interested in everyone else's total and utter guff&quot; but &quot;his one line frequently had to be the funniest of the lot.&quot; Iannucci suggests that Bernard is essential to the structure of the show because both Hacker and Appleby confide in him, &quot;which means we get to find out what they're plotting next.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-characters">Other characters</h2>
<p>The series featured a cast of recurring characters. Frank Weisel (often deprecatingly called <em>weasel</em>), played by <a href="Neil_Fitzwiliam" title="wikilink">Neil Fitzwiliam</a>, was Hacker's political adviser in the first series. It was not until <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> that another such character appeared regularly: Dorothy Wainwright, special adviser to the Prime Minister, who was played by <a href="Deborah_Norton" title="wikilink">Deborah Norton</a>. Hacker also had a <a href="Press_Secretary" title="wikilink">Press Secretary</a>, Bill Pritchard, played by Antony Carrick. Meanwhile, Sir Humphrey's civil service colleagues were regularly featured. They included Sir Arnold Robinson (played by <a href="John_Nettleton_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Nettleton</a>), Cabinet Secretary in <em>Yes Minister</em> and later President of the <a href="Campaign_for_Freedom_of_Information" title="wikilink">Campaign for</a> <a href="Freedom_of_information_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Freedom of Information</a>; Sir Frederick Stewart (played by <a href="John_Savident" title="wikilink">John Savident</a>), Permanent Secretary of the <a href="Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office" title="wikilink">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>, known as &quot;Jumbo&quot; to his friends; Sir Ian Whitchurch (played by <a href="John_Barron_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Barron</a>), Permanent Secretary to the <a href="Department_of_Health_and_Social_Security" title="wikilink">Department of Health and Social Security</a> and Sir Frank Gordon, who appeared in both series of <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> as Permanent Secretary to the <a href="HM_Treasury" title="wikilink">Treasury</a> (played by <a href="Peter_Cellier" title="wikilink">Peter Cellier</a>). Sir Humphrey also had an old acquaintance: Sir Desmond Glazebrook (played by <a href="Richard_Vernon" title="wikilink">Richard Vernon</a>), who was Board member, then Chairman, of Bartlett's Bank. He became Governor of the <a href="Bank_of_England" title="wikilink">Bank of England</a> in the <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> episode &quot;<a href="A_Conflict_of_Interest" title="wikilink">A Conflict of Interest</a>&quot;. (This was to avoid, as one possibility, Britain's expulsion from the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a>.)</p>
<p>Hacker's family comprised his wife, Annie (played by <a href="Diana_Hoddinott" title="wikilink">Diana Hoddinott</a>), who appeared in several episodes, and his daughter, Lucy (played by <a href="Gerry_Cowper" title="wikilink">Gerry Cowper</a>), who only appeared on-screen in one episode (&quot;<a href="The_Right_to_Know" title="wikilink">The Right to Know</a>&quot;) but who is mentioned intermittently throughout. At one point (in &quot;<a href="Party_Games_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">Party Games</a>&quot;) it is suggested that the Hackers have more than one child, but as this occurs when stating a well-rehearsed rebuttal, this could be seen as one more instance where the Minister has become &quot;house trained&quot; to conform to departmental convenience (even though the Minister is in the running for the leadership).</p>
<p>Hacker's chauffeur, George (<a href="Arthur_Cox" title="wikilink">Arthur Cox</a>), appeared in five episodes. He is a character who is always more in touch with current events than the Minister—anything from empty <a href="National_Health_Service_(England)" title="wikilink">NHS</a> hospitals to <a href="Cabinet_shuffle" title="wikilink">Cabinet reshuffles</a>. This often irritates Hacker who, when he asks George where the information came from, is usually told that it is common knowledge among the Whitehall drivers. Well-known broadcasters who played themselves included <a href="Robert_McKenzie_(psephologist)" title="wikilink">Robert McKenzie</a>, <a href="Ludovic_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Ludovic Kennedy</a> and <a href="Sue_Lawley" title="wikilink">Sue Lawley</a>. <a href="Robert_Dougall" title="wikilink">Robert Dougall</a> regularly played a newsreader, which was his own real life profession. Another newscaster, <a href="Nicholas_Witchell" title="wikilink">Nicholas Witchell</a>, can be heard reporting on Hacker's visit to a school in &quot;<a href="The_National_Education_Service" title="wikilink">The National Education Service</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Tom Sargent (<a href="Robert_Urquhart" title="wikilink">Robert Urquhart</a>), Hacker's predecessor as Minister for Administrative Affairs in the previous government, appeared in the episode &quot;<a href="Big_Brother_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">Big Brother</a>&quot;. Basil Corbett is a rival politician who, though he is not seen, is central to the plot of &quot;<a href="The_Devil_You_Know_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">The Devil You Know</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="episodes">Episodes</h2>

<p>A total of thirty-eight episodes were made, and all but one are of 30 minutes' duration. They were videotaped in front of a studio audience, which was standard BBC practice for situation comedies at the time. The actors did not enjoy filming as they felt that the studio audience added additional pressure. Lynn, however, says that the studio audience on the soundtrack was necessary because laughter is a &quot;communal affair.&quot; The laughter also acted as a kind of insurance: Jay observes that politicians would be unable to put pressure on the BBC not to &quot;run this kind of nonsense&quot; if &quot;200&lt;U+2013&gt;250 people were falling about with laughter.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> There were occasionally film inserts of location sequences, and some shots of Hacker travelling in his car were achieved by means of <a href="chroma_key" title="wikilink">chroma key</a>. Each programme usually comprised around six scenes.</p>
<p>The pilot was produced in 1979 but not transmitted until 1980 in fear that it could influence the results of the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="wikilink">1979 UK General Election</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <em>Yes Minister</em> ran for three series, each of seven episodes, between 1980 and 1982. These were followed by two <a href="Christmas_special" title="wikilink">Christmas specials</a>: one 10-minute sketch as part of an anthology presented by <a href="Frank_Muir" title="wikilink">Frank Muir</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and then the hour-long &quot;<a href="Party_Games_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">Party Games</a>&quot;, in 1984. The latter's events led to Hacker's elevation to Prime Minister, dovetailing into the sequel, <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>. This ran for two series, each of eight episodes, from 1986 to 1988.</p>
<h2 id="opening-titles-and-music">Opening titles and music</h2>
<p><img src="Scarfejh.jpg" title="fig:Gerald Scarfe&#39;s caricature of Paul Eddington as Hacker" alt="Gerald Scarfe&#39;s caricature of Paul Eddington as Hacker" /> The opening titles were drawn by artist <a href="Gerald_Scarfe" title="wikilink">Gerald Scarfe</a>, who provided distinctive <a href="caricature" title="wikilink">caricatures</a> of Eddington, Hawthorne and Fowlds in their respective roles to represent distortion.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He <a href="animation" title="wikilink">animated</a> them as 'self-drawing' by positioning the camera above his paper, adding parts of lines, and then photographing two frames at a time. The sequence ended with the title of the episode superimposed on a facsimile of an edition of the House of Commons <em>Weekly Information Bulletin.</em> Curiously, the legend <em>Compiled in the Public Information Office of the House of Commons Library</em> was left in the sequence. Scarfe created a second set of graphics for <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, including a different title card for each episode. Derek Fowlds wanted to buy an original drawing but was unable to afford it.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The series' performance credits typically only featured those of the actors who appeared in the particular episode, not the names of characters.</p>
<p>The <a href="theme_music" title="wikilink">theme music</a> was composed by <a href="Ronnie_Hazlehurst" title="wikilink">Ronnie Hazlehurst</a> and is largely based on the <a href="Westminster_Quarters" title="wikilink">Westminster Quarters</a>: the chimes of <a href="Clock_Tower,_Palace_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Big Ben</a>. When asked in an interview about its <a href="Palace_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Westminster</a> influence, Hazlehurst replied, &quot;That's all it is. It's the easiest thing I've ever done.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Scarfe's and Hazlehurst's work was not used for the first episode, &quot;<a href="Open_Government_(Yes_Minister)" title="wikilink">Open Government</a>&quot;. The final version of the titles and music had yet to be agreed, and both differ substantially from those used for subsequent instalments. The opening and closing title caption cards feature drawings of most of the cast, but are less exaggerated than those of Scarfe, while the unaccredited music is a more up-tempo piece for <a href="brass_band" title="wikilink">brass band</a>. The Scarfe and Hazlehurst credits were used for some repeat broadcasts of the first episode, but the original pilot credits were retained for the DVD release.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The series gained high audience figures, and 90+ on the audience <a href="Appreciation_Index" title="wikilink">Appreciation Index</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Critics, such as Andrew Davies in the <em><a href="Times_Educational_Supplement" title="wikilink">Times Educational Supplement</a></em> and Armando Iannucci, have noted that the show demanded high expectations from its audience.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Lynn posits that the public are more intelligent than most situation comedies, often patronising, give them credit for. Jay believes that the viewers were just as intelligent as the writers, but that there were some things that they needed to know but didn't.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Yes Minister</em> won the <a href="British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="wikilink">BAFTA</a> award for Best Comedy Series for 1980, 1981 and 1982, and the &quot;Party Games&quot; special was nominated in the Best Light Entertainment Programme category for 1984. <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> was short-listed for Best Comedy Series for both 1986 and 1987. Nigel Hawthorne's portrayal of Sir Humphrey Appleby won the BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times (in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987). Eddington was also nominated on all four occasions.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Yes Minister</em> came sixth in a 2004 <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> poll to find '<a href="Britain&#39;s_Best_Sitcom" title="wikilink">Britain's Best Sitcom</a>'.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In a list of the <a href="100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes" title="wikilink">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> drawn up by the <a href="British_Film_Institute" title="wikilink">British Film Institute</a> in 2000, voted by industry professionals, <em>Yes Minister</em> and <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> were jointly placed ninth.

<p><img src="Yes_Minister_-_Thatcher_sketch.jpg" title="fig:Hawthorne and Eddington performing the sketch with Thatcher in January 1984." alt="Hawthorne and Eddington performing the sketch with Thatcher in January 1984." /> Thatcher performed a short sketch with Eddington and Hawthorne on 20 January 1984 at a ceremony where the writers were presented with an award from <a href="Mary_Whitehouse" title="wikilink">Mary Whitehouse</a>'s <a href="NVLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NVLA</a>,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> an event commemorated on the cover of the satirical magazine <a href="Private_Eye" title="wikilink">Private Eye</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Authorship of the sketch is unclear.

<p>When Paul Eddington visited Australia during the 1980s, he was treated as a visiting British PM by the then Australian leader, <a href="Bob_Hawke" title="wikilink">Bob Hawke</a>, who was obviously a great fan of the show.

<p>The show has been remade several times. The first was the Canadian remake in 1987 <em><a href="Not_My_Department" title="wikilink">Not My Department</a></em>, which only lasted one season. <em>Rosenbaddarna</em> (from 1990) was the Swedish unofficial remake. The title of the Portuguese remake, <em>Sim, Sr. Ministro</em> (from 1996), is a direct translation of the original's title. <em><a href="Ji,_Mantriji" title="wikilink">Ji, Mantriji</a></em> (2001) was the remake in <a href="Hindi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindi</a> (with the BBC's permission) by <a href="STAR_Plus" title="wikilink">STAR Plus</a>, <a href="Rupert_Murdoch" title="wikilink">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s Indian satellite TV channel.
