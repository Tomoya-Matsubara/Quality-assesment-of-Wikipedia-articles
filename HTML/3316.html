<p><strong>James Houston Davis</strong> (September 11, 1899 – November 5, 2000), better known as <strong>Jimmie Davis</strong>, was a noted <a href="singer" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer</a> of both sacred and popular songs who served two nonconsecutive terms as the <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Louisiana" title="wikilink">47th Governor of Louisiana</a> (1944–1948 and 1960–1964). He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Davis was born in 1899 to a <a href="sharecropping" class="uri" title="wikilink">sharecropping</a> couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works and Samuel Jones Davis, in the now-<a href="ghost_town" title="wikilink">ghost town</a> of Beech Springs near <a href="Quitman,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Quitman</a> in <a href="Jackson_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Jackson Parish</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The family was so poor that young Jimmie did not have a bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old.</p>
<p>He graduated from Beech Springs High School and Soule Business College, <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> campus. The late <a href="U.S._Representative" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Otto_Passman" title="wikilink">Otto Ernest Passman</a>, a Louisiana Democrat, also graduated from Soule, but from the <a href="Bogalusa,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Bogalusa</a> campus. Davis received his <a href="bachelor&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">bachelor's degree</a> in <a href="history" class="uri" title="wikilink">history</a> from the <a href="Baptist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptist</a>-affiliated <a href="Louisiana_College" title="wikilink">Louisiana College</a> in <a href="Pineville,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Pineville</a>. He received a <a href="master&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">master's degree</a> from <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">Louisiana State University</a> in <a href="Baton_Rouge" title="wikilink">Baton Rouge</a>. Davis's 1927 master's thesis examines the intelligence levels of different races, and is titled <em>Comparative Intelligence of Whites, Blacks and Mulattoes.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Davis taught history (and, unofficially, <a href="yodeling" class="uri" title="wikilink">yodeling</a>) for a year at the former Dodd College for Girls in <a href="Shreveport,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Shreveport</a> during the late 1920s. He was hired by the college president, <a href="Monroe_E._Dodd" title="wikilink">Monroe Elmon Dodd</a>, who was also the pastor of the large First <a href="Baptist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptist</a> Church of Shreveport and a pioneer <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> preacher.</p>
<h2 id="musical-career">Musical career</h2>
<p>Davis became a commercially successful singer of rural music before he entered politics. His early work was in the style of early <a href="Country_Music" title="wikilink">Country Music</a> luminary <a href="Jimmie_Rodgers_(country_singer)" title="wikilink">Jimmie Rodgers</a>, and he was also known for recording energetic and raunchy blues tunes like &quot;Red Nightgown Blues&quot;. Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman <a href="Oscar_Woods" title="wikilink">Oscar Woods</a>. During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis's campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some of the records over an outdoor sound system only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics. Davis until the end of his life never denied or repudiated those records.</p>
<p>He is associated with several popular songs, most notably &quot;<a href="You_Are_My_Sunshine" title="wikilink">You Are My Sunshine</a>&quot;, which was designated an official <a href="state_song" title="wikilink">state song</a> of Louisiana in 1977. He claimed that he wrote the song while attending graduate school at LSU, but research indicates he bought it from another performer, <a href="Paul_Rice_(musician)" title="wikilink">Paul Rice</a>, who had recorded it with his brother Hoke, who recorded together as the Rice Brothers under Paul Rice's name. The practice of buying songs from their composers was a common practice during the 1930s through the 1960s as some writers in need of cash often sold tunes to others.</p>
<p>Rice himself had adapted it from another person's poem. Reportedly, the song was copyrighted under Davis' name and that of longtime sideman <a href="Charles_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Charles Mitchell</a>, after they purchased it from Rice. Davis also purchased the country ballad &quot;It Makes No Difference Now&quot; from its composer <a href="Floyd_Tillman" title="wikilink">Floyd Tillman</a>. Tillman later had his composer credit restored alongside that of Davis.</p>
<p>In 1999, &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was honored with a <a href="Grammy_Hall_of_Fame_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Hall of Fame Award</a> and the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a> named it one of the <a href="Songs_of_the_Century" title="wikilink">Songs of the Century</a>. &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was ranked No. 73 on <em>CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music</em> in 2003. Until his death, Davis insisted that he wrote the song. In any case, it will forever be associated with him.</p>
<p>Davis became the popular &quot;singing governor&quot; who often performed during his campaign stops. While governor, he had a No. 1 hit <a href="single_(music)" title="wikilink">single</a> in 1945 with &quot;<a href="There&#39;s_a_New_Moon_Over_My_Shoulder" title="wikilink">There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder</a>&quot;. A long-time member of the <a href="Baptist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptist</a> faith, he also recorded a number of <a href="Southern_gospel" title="wikilink">Southern gospel</a> <a href="album" title="wikilink">albums</a> and in 1967 served as president of the <a href="Gospel_Music_Association" title="wikilink">Gospel Music Association</a>. He was a close friend of the <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>-born band leader <a href="Lawrence_Welk" title="wikilink">Lawrence Welk</a> who frequently reminded viewers of his television program of his association with Governor Davis.</p>
<p>A number of his songs were used as part of <a href="motion_picture" title="wikilink">motion picture</a> <a href="soundtrack" title="wikilink">soundtracks</a>, and Davis himself appeared in half a dozen films, one with the popular entertainers <a href="Ozzie_and_Harriet" title="wikilink">Ozzie and Harriet</a>. Members of Davis' last band included <a href="Allen_&quot;Puddler&quot;_Harris" title="wikilink">Allen &quot;Puddler&quot; Harris</a> of <a href="Lake_Charles,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Lake Charles</a>, who had also been an original <a href="pianist" class="uri" title="wikilink">pianist</a> of <a href="Ricky_Nelson" title="wikilink">Ricky Nelson</a>.</p>
<h2 id="movie-career">Movie career</h2>
<p>Davis had several appearances in movies (usually or always as himself), including:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>
<p>Davis was elected as Shreveport's public safety commissioner as a Democrat. (At the time, Shreveport had the <a href="city_commission" title="wikilink">city commission</a> form of government. In the 1970s, the city switched to the current <a href="mayor-council" class="uri" title="wikilink">mayor-council</a> format.) Davis was elected in 1942 to the <a href="Louisiana_Public_Service_Commission" title="wikilink">Louisiana Public Service Commission</a> but left the rate-making body, which meets in Baton Rouge, two years later to become governor.</p>
<h3 id="first-term-as-governor-19441948">First term as governor (1944–1948)</h3>

<p>Davis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. He defeated <a href="Lewis_L._Morgan" title="wikilink">Lewis L. Morgan</a> of <a href="Covington,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Covington</a>, the seat of <a href="St._Tammany_Parish" title="wikilink">St. Tammany Parish</a>, who had been backed by former Governor <a href="Earl_Kemp_Long" title="wikilink">Earl Kemp Long</a> and New Orleans Mayor <a href="Robert_Maestri" title="wikilink">Robert Maestri</a>. Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 (46.5 percent). Eliminated in the primary were a number of candidates, including freshman U.S. Representative <a href="James_H._Morrison" title="wikilink">James Hobson &quot;Jimmy&quot; Morrison</a> of <a href="Hammond,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Hammond</a> in <a href="Tangipahoa_Parish" title="wikilink">Tangipahoa Parish</a>.</p>
<p>Davis pleased conservatives with his appointment of <a href="Cecil_Morgan" title="wikilink">Cecil Morgan</a> to the Louisiana <a href="Civil_Service" title="wikilink">Civil Service</a> Commission. Morgan, as a <a href="Caddo_Parish" title="wikilink">Caddo Parish</a> legislator, had led the <a href="impeachment" class="uri" title="wikilink">impeachment</a> forces against <a href="Governor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Huey_Long" title="wikilink">Huey Pierce Long, Jr.</a> in 1929 and later took a high position with <a href="Standard_Oil_Company" title="wikilink">Standard Oil Company</a>. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by <a href="Rupert_Peyton" title="wikilink">Rupert Peyton</a> of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis.</p>
<p>Long was seeking the lieutenant governorship on the Lewis Morgan &quot;ticket&quot; and led in the first primary, but he lost the runoff to <a href="J._Emile_Verret" title="wikilink">J. Emile Verret</a> of <a href="New_Iberia,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Iberia</a>, who was the president of the <a href="Iberia_Parish" title="wikilink">Iberia Parish</a> <a href="School_Board" title="wikilink">School Board</a>.</p>
<p>Davis kept his hand in show business, and set a record for absenteeism during his first term with trips to <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> to make Western &quot;<a href="horse_operas" title="wikilink">horse operas</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Davis was <a href="term_limit" title="wikilink">term-limited</a> to a single non-consecutive term in office.</p>
<h3 id="the-election-of-1959-1960">The election of 1959-1960</h3>

<p>As a candidate for a second term in 1959–1960, Davis had been out of office for nearly a dozen years. Three <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">Louisiana State University</a> political scientists described him, accordingly:</p>
<p>&quot;Davis has all of the external attributes of a 'man of the people', but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. . . . Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>With a pledge to fight for continued <a href="Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">segregation</a> in public education, Davis won the Democratic <a href="gubernatorial" class="uri" title="wikilink">gubernatorial</a> nomination over a crowded field that included staunchly segregationist State Senator <a href="William_M._Rainach" title="wikilink">William Monroe Rainach</a> of <a href="Claiborne_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Claiborne Parish</a>, former Lieutenant Governor <a href="Bill_Dodd" title="wikilink">William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Dodd</a> of <a href="Baton_Rouge" title="wikilink">Baton Rouge</a>, former Governor <a href="James_A._Noe" title="wikilink">James Albert Noe, Sr.</a>, of <a href="Monroe,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Monroe</a>, and <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> Mayor <a href="deLesseps_Story_Morrison" title="wikilink">deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr.</a> A member of the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>, <a href="A._Roswell_Thompson" title="wikilink">A. Roswell Thompson</a>, the operator of a New Orleans <a href="taxi_stand" title="wikilink">taxi stand</a>, also filed candidacy papers. Davis ran second to &quot;Chep&quot; Morrison, considered an anti-Long <a href="Liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a> by Louisiana standards, in the primary but then defeated Morrison in the party runoff held in January 1960.</p>
<p>Davis polled 213,551 (25.3 percent) to Morrison's 278,956 (33.1 percent). Rainach ran third with 143,095 (17 percent). Noe was fourth with 97,654 (11.6 percent), and Dodd followed with 85,436 (10.1 percent). Davis won the northern and central parts of the state plus Baton Rouge, while Morrison dominated the southern portion of the state, particularly the <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> cultural parishes. In the runoff, Davis prevailed, 487,681 (54.1 percent) to Morrison's 414,110 (45.5 percent). It was estimated that Davis drew virtually all of the Rainach support from the first primary.</p>
<p>Earl Long endorsed Davis in the runoff because he had a longstanding personal distaste for Morrison. Long, meanwhile, had run unsuccessfully for <a href="Lieutenant_Governor_of_Louisiana" title="wikilink">lieutenant governor</a> in the first primary. There was a runoff between Morrison's choice for the job, Alexandria Mayor <a href="W._George_Bowdon,_Jr." title="wikilink">W. George Bowdon, Jr.</a>, and Davis's selection, former state House Speaker <a href="Clarence_C._Aycock" title="wikilink">Clarence C. &quot;Taddy&quot; Aycock</a> of <a href="Franklin,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Franklin</a> in <a href="St._Mary_Parish" title="wikilink">St. Mary Parish</a>. Aycock defeated Bowdon by a margin similar to that of Davis over Morrison. The defeat was Long's second for lieutenant governor. He had lost also in the 1944 primary to <a href="J._Emile_Verret" title="wikilink">J. Emile Verret</a> of <a href="Iberia_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Iberia Parish</a>.</p>
<p>Davis effectively used the slogan &quot;He's One of Us&quot; in the gubernatorial race. Number six on the ballot, he assembled an intraparty ticket for other statewide constitutional officers, including Aycock for lieutenant governor, <a href="Roy_R._Theriot" title="wikilink">Roy R. Theriot</a> of <a href="Abbeville,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Abbeville</a> for <a href="comptroller" class="uri" title="wikilink">comptroller</a>, <a href="Douglas_Fowler" title="wikilink">Douglas Fowler</a> of <a href="Coushatta,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Coushatta</a> for custodian of voting machines, <a href="Jack_P.F._Gremillion" title="wikilink">Jack P.F. Gremillion</a> for <a href="attorney_general" title="wikilink">attorney general</a>, <a href="Dave_L._Pearce" title="wikilink">Dave L. Pearce</a> for agriculture commissioner, <a href="Ellen_Bryan_Moore" title="wikilink">Ellen Bryan Moore</a> for register of state lands, and Rufus Hayes for <a href="insurance" class="uri" title="wikilink">insurance</a> commissioner, all based in Baton Rouge. The entire Davis ticket was elected.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In their study <em>The Louisiana Election of 1960</em>, William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and <a href="Perry_H._Howard" title="wikilink">Perry H. Howard</a> demonstrated that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison in the eastern and western extremities of South Louisiana. Davis also secured the backing of <a href="organized_labor" title="wikilink">organized labor</a> and made inroads among the white, urban working class, which was essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. Morrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent suburban <a href="Jefferson_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Jefferson Parish</a>, but in the industrial strip and in less Roman Catholic areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts indicated that the lion's share of the additional ballots were segregationists who supported Davis.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="general_election" title="wikilink">general election</a> on April 19, 1960, Davis defeated <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> <a href="Francis_Grevemberg" title="wikilink">Francis Grevemberg</a>, a <a href="Lafayette,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Lafayette</a> native, by a margin of nearly 82&lt;U+2013&gt;17 percent. Grevemberg had been head of the state police under Governor <a href="Robert_F._Kennon" title="wikilink">Robert F. Kennon</a> and had gained a reputation for fighting <a href="organized_crime" title="wikilink">organized crime</a>. He called for the origin of a two-party system for Louisiana. As the Democratic nominee, Davis had no worries and did little campaigning against Grevemberg. It has been reported that had <a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Curtis_LeMay" title="wikilink">Curtis LeMay</a> turned down <a href="George_C._Wallace" title="wikilink">George C. Wallace</a>'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the <a href="American_Independent_Party" title="wikilink">American Independent Party</a> ticket that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president.</p>
<h4 id="davis-and-dodd">Davis and Dodd</h4>
<p>In the 1959 campaign, Bill Dodd had attacked Davis ferociously: it was part of Dodd's strategy to get Davis to withdraw from the primary. &quot;Nothing personal in his [Dodd's] heart, just a cold-blooded plan to wind up in a second primary against Morrison, who he figured could not win against anyone [else] in a runoff,&quot; said Davis in the introduction to Dodd's memoirs, <em>Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics</em>. Dodd then endorsed Morrison in the runoff, but he had a long-term reason for doing so. Dodd planned to run for school superintendent in the 1963 primary, and he wanted to have at least the neutrality of Morrison four years thereafter.</p>
<p>Dodd and Davis later became close friends. In Davis' words:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Bill and I have many things in common. We share the same type of religion and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.

<h3 id="second-term-1960-1964">Second term (1960-1964)</h3>
<p>Davis' appointees in the second term included outgoing State Representative <a href="Claude_Kirkpatrick" title="wikilink">Claude Kirkpatrick</a> of <a href="Jennings,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Jennings</a>, the seat of <a href="Jefferson_Davis_Parish" title="wikilink">Jefferson Davis Parish</a>, who was named to succeed <a href="Lorris_M._Wimberly" title="wikilink">Lorris M. Wimberly</a> as the Director of <a href="Public_Works" title="wikilink">Public Works</a>. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with the <a href="State_of_Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a> to establish the popular <a href="Toledo_Bend_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Toledo Bend Reservoir</a>, a haven for <a href="boating" class="uri" title="wikilink">boating</a> and <a href="fishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishing</a>. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former <a href="Edith_Killgore_Kirkpatrick" title="wikilink">Edith Killgore</a>, a native of Claiborne Parish in north Louisiana, headed Davis's women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman <a href="Morgan_W._Walker,_Sr." title="wikilink">Morgan W. Walker, Sr.</a>, to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of <a href="Continental_Trailways" title="wikilink">Continental Trailways</a> <a href="Bus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bus</a> lines. Davis named <a href="Ray_Burgess" title="wikilink">Ray Burgess</a> of Baton Rouge as highway director, who even considered running for governor in the 1963 primary.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In his second term, Davis secured passage of a $60 million public improvements <a href="bond_issue" title="wikilink">bond issue</a> through the State Board and Building Commission, an organization controlled by the governor. He gained legislative support from many formerly pro-Long lawmakers and cemented his hold on the traditional anti-Long bloc. He avoided defeat on any legislation that he strongly supported and was able to defeat nearly all bills with which he did not concur. He offered tacit support to the <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> national Democrats to secure the state's hold of pending offshore oil revenues. In the 1963 legislative fiscal session, he defeated efforts to procure an unpledged presidential elector slate for the 1964 general election, by which time he had been succeeded by <a href="John_J._McKeithen" title="wikilink">John J. McKeithen</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fourth-place-in-1971">Fourth place in 1971</h2>

<p>In 1971, Davis entered another crowded Democratic <a href="gubernatorial" class="uri" title="wikilink">gubernatorial</a> primary field with new political prospects, but he finished in fourth place with 138,756 ballots (11.8 percent).</p>
<p>In a runoff election held in December 1971, U.S. Representative <a href="Edwin_Washington_Edwards" title="wikilink">Edwin Washington Edwards</a> of <a href="Crowley,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Crowley</a> in <a href="Acadia_Parish" title="wikilink">Acadia Parish</a> defeated then state Senator <a href="Bennett_Johnston" title="wikilink">J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.</a>, of <a href="Shreveport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shreveport</a> for the party nomination. That vote was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards then beat Republican <a href="David_C._Treen" title="wikilink">David C. Treen</a> in the March 1972 <a href="general_election" title="wikilink">general election</a>. Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him at that point.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his life, longtime Democrat Davis endorsed at least two Republican candidates: state Representative <a href="Woody_Jenkins" title="wikilink">Louis E. &quot;Woody&quot; Jenkins</a> of Baton Rouge for the U.S. Senate against Democrat <a href="Mary_Landrieu" title="wikilink">Mary Landrieu</a> in 1996 and the reelection of Governor <a href="Mike_Foster" title="wikilink">Murphy J. &quot;Mike&quot; Foster, Jr.</a>, who faced little opposition in 1999 from <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> Democratic Congressman <a href="Bill_Jefferson" title="wikilink">William &quot;Bill&quot; Jefferson</a> of New Orleans.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-legacy">Political legacy</h2>
<p>Davis established a State Retirement System and funding of more than $100 million in public improvements while leaving the state with a $38 million surplus after his first term.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>During his second term, Davis built the Sunshine Bridge, the new <a href="Louisiana_Governor&#39;s_Mansion" title="wikilink">Louisiana Governor's Mansion</a>, and Toledo Bend Reservoir, all criticized at the time, but later recognized as beneficial to the state. Davis coordinated the pay periods of state employees, who had sometimes received their checks a week late, a particular hardship to those with low incomes.</p>
<p>During his time as governor, Davis attempted to enforce policies of racial segregation, but federal law slowly brought about <a href="desegregation" class="uri" title="wikilink">desegregation</a>. One time during his tenure, he rode his horse up the steps of the <a href="Louisiana_State_Capitol" title="wikilink">Louisiana State Capitol</a> to protest integration. Davis apologized for his actions later in life. </p>
