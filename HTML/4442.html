<p><img src="Shuttle-Mir_Patch_(Large).jpg" title="fig:Shuttle-Mir_Patch_(Large).jpg" alt="Shuttle-Mir_Patch_(Large).jpg" width="300" /> The <strong>Shuttle–Mir Program</strong> was a collaborative space program between <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, which involved American <a href="Space_Shuttle" title="wikilink">Space Shuttles</a> visiting the Russian <a href="space_station" title="wikilink">space station</a> <em><a href="Mir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mir</a></em>, Russian cosmonauts flying on the shuttle and American astronauts engaging in long-duration expeditions aboard <em>Mir</em>.</p>
<p>The program, under the code name 'Phase One', was intended to allow the United States to learn from Russian experience into long-duration spaceflight and to foster a spirit of cooperation between the two nations and their respective <a href="List_of_space_agencies" title="wikilink">space agencies</a>, <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> and <a href="RKA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RKA</a>, in preparation for further cooperative space ventures. Announced in 1993 with the first mission occurring in 1994, the program continued until its scheduled completion in 1998, and consisted of eleven shuttle missions, a joint <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Soyuz</a> flight and almost 1000 days in space for American astronauts over seven expeditions.</p>
<p>During the four-year program, many 'firsts' in spaceflight were obtained by the two nations, including the first American astronaut to launch aboard a <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Soyuz</a> spacecraft, the largest spacecraft ever flown at that time in history, and the first American spacewalk using a Russian <a href="Orlan_space_suits" title="wikilink">Orlan spacesuit</a>.</p>
<p>The program was, however, marred by various concerns, notably the safety of <em>Mir</em> following a fire and collision on board the station, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program and worries from astronauts about the attitudes of the program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing 'Phase Two' of the joint project, the construction of the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">International Space Station</a>, to proceed much more smoothly than otherwise possible.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><img src="Atlantis_Docked_to_Mir.jpg" title="fig:Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to Mir on STS-71." alt="Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to Mir on STS-71." width="250" /> In June 1992, <a href="American_president" title="wikilink">American president</a> <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H. W. Bush</a> and <a href="President_of_the_Russian_Federation" title="wikilink">Russian president</a> <a href="Boris_Yeltsin" title="wikilink">Boris Yeltsin</a> agreed to join hands in <a href="space_exploration" title="wikilink">space exploration</a> by signing the &quot;Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of <a href="Outer_space" title="wikilink">Outer Space</a> for Peaceful Purposes&quot;. The agreement called for the setting up a short, joint space program, during which one US <a href="astronaut" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronaut</a> would board the Russian space station <em>Mir</em> and two Russian <a href="astronaut" title="wikilink">cosmonauts</a> would board a <a href="Space_Shuttle" title="wikilink">Space Shuttle</a>. In September 1993, however, American Vice-president <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a> and Russian prime minister <a href="Viktor_Chernomyrdin" title="wikilink">Viktor Chernomyrdin</a> announced plans for a new space station, later to be called the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">International Space Station</a>, or ISS. They also agreed that, in preparation for this new project, America would be largely involved in the <em>Mir</em> program in the years ahead, under the code name 'Phase One' (the construction of the ISS being 'Phase Two').<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>During the course of the program, eleven Space Shuttle missions flew to the station, carrying out crew exchanges, flying a <a href="Mir_Docking_Module" title="wikilink">docking module</a> and a new set of solar arrays to <em>Mir</em> and conducting a myriad of scientific experiments aboard the space station. The program also saw the launch of two new modules, <em><a href="Spektr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em> and <em><a href="Priroda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Priroda</a></em>, to <em>Mir</em>, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> and the <a href="Russian_Federal_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> to learn a great deal about how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimise the risks associated with assembling a large space station — the ISS — in orbit.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to these scientific advances, the program also served as a political ruse on the part of the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American government</a>, providing diplomatic channel for NASA to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly-fledged <a href="Politics_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Russian government</a> to keep <em>Mir</em> operating, in addition to the space program as a whole (a purpose which continues into Phase Two), ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="increments">Increments</h3>
<p><img src="Shuttle-Mir_Astronauts.jpg" title="fig:The seven American astronauts who carried out long-duration Increments on Mir." alt="The seven American astronauts who carried out long-duration Increments on Mir." width="250" /> In addition to the flights of the Shuttle to <em>Mir</em>, Phase One also featured seven 'Increments' aboard the station, long-duration flights aboard <em>Mir</em> by American astronauts. The seven astronauts who took part in the Increments, <a href="Norman_Thagard" title="wikilink">Norman Thagard</a>, <a href="Shannon_Lucid" title="wikilink">Shannon Lucid</a>, <a href="John_Blaha" title="wikilink">John Blaha</a>, <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a>, <a href="Michael_Foale" title="wikilink">Michael Foale</a>, <a href="David_Wolf" title="wikilink">David Wolf</a> and <a href="Andrew_Thomas" title="wikilink">Andrew Thomas</a>, were each flown in turn to <a href="Star_City,_Russia" title="wikilink">Star City</a>, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, to undergo training in various aspects of the operation of <em>Mir</em> and the <a href="Soyuz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soyuz</a> spacecraft used for transport to and from the Station. The astronauts also received practice in carrying out <a href="spacewalks" class="uri" title="wikilink">spacewalks</a> outside <em>Mir</em> and lessons in the <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian language</a>, which would be used throughout their missions to talk with the other cosmonauts aboard the station and Mission Control in Russia, the <a href="Mission_Control_Center#FKA_Mission_Control_Center" title="wikilink">TsUP</a>.</p>
<p>During their expeditions aboard <em>Mir</em>, the astronauts carried out various experiments, including growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds of photographs of the <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the ageing station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks.</p>
<p>In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days aboard <em>Mir</em>, allowing NASA to learn a great deal about long-duration spaceflight, particularly in the areas of astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews aboard space stations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Mir</em> herself was the world's first modular space station, constructed between 1986 and 1996. She was humanity's first consistently inhabited long-term <a href="research_station" title="wikilink">research station</a> in space, and currently holds the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of 10 years. <em>Mir's</em> purpose was to provide a large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including Phase One, she was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until <a href="23_March" title="wikilink">23 March</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, at which point she was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.</p>
<p><em>Mir</em> was based upon the <a href="Salyut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salyut</a> series of space stations previously launched by <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">the Soviet Union</a> (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned <a href="Soyuz_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Soyuz spacecraft</a> and <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress</a> cargo ships. It was also anticipated that she would also be the destination for flights by the later-abandoned <a href="Buran_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Buran</a> space shuttle. The visiting US Space Shuttles used a <a href="Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System" title="wikilink">Androgynous Peripheral Attach System</a> docking collar originally designed for Buran, mounted on a bracket originally designed for use with the American <a href="Space_Station_Freedom" title="wikilink">Space Station Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>With the Space Shuttle docked to <em>Mir</em> the temporary enlargements of living and working areas amounted to a complex that was the world's largest <a href="spacecraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">spacecraft</a> at that time in space history, with a combined mass of 250 <a href="Tonne" title="wikilink">metric tonnes</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

A total of five usable orbiters were built, of which three remain. The winged shuttle <a href="Space_Shuttle_Orbiter" title="wikilink">Orbiter</a> is launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven <a href="astronaut" title="wikilink">astronauts</a> (although eight have been carried and eleven could be accommodated in an emergency) along with up to 50,000 <a href="Pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">lb</a> (22,700 <a href="kg" class="uri" title="wikilink">kg</a>) of payload into <a href="low_earth_orbit" title="wikilink">low earth orbit</a>.

During the descent and landing, the shuttle Orbiter acts as a <a href="glider" class="uri" title="wikilink">glider</a> and makes a completely unpowered landing.</p>
<p>The Shuttle is the first orbital <a href="spacecraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">spacecraft</a> designed for partial <a href="reusable_launch_system" title="wikilink">reusability</a>. It carries large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle-Mir and ISS programs, provides crew rotation and carries various supplies, modules and pieces of equipment to the stations. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years' operational life.</p>
<p>During the course of Phase One, <em>Mir</em> was visited by Space Shuttles <a href="Space_Shuttle_Discovery" title="wikilink"><em>Discovery</em></a>, <a href="Space_Shuttle_Atlantis" title="wikilink"><em>Atlantis</em></a> and <a href="Space_Shuttle_Endeavour" title="wikilink"><em>Endeavour</em></a>, with <em>Atlantis</em> in particular flying seven straight missions to the station from 1995 – 1997.

In all, Blaha spent four months with the Mir-22 Cosmonaut crew conducting <a href="material_science" title="wikilink">material science</a>, <a href="Fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid science</a>, and <a href="life_science" title="wikilink">life science</a> research, before returning to Earth the next year aboard <em>Atlantis</em> on <a href="STS-81" class="uri" title="wikilink">STS-81</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>1997 would prove to be an interesting year for the program, beginning with the first Shuttle flight for that year, STS-81, replacing Increment astronaut John Blaha with <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a>, after Blaha's 118-day stay aboard <em>Mir</em>. During this fifth docking of a shuttle, the crew of <em>Atlantis</em> moved supplies to the station and returned to Earth the first plants to complete a life cycle in space, a crop of wheat planted by Shannon Lucid. During five days of mated operations, the crews transferred nearly 6000 pounds of logistics to <em>Mir</em>, and transferred 2,400 pounds of materials back to <em>Atlantis</em> (the most materials transferred between the two spacecraft to that date).</p>
<p>The STS-81 crew also tested the Shuttle Treadmill <a href="Vibration_isolation" title="wikilink">Vibration Isolation</a> and Stabilization System (TVIS), designed for use in the <a href="ISS_Zvezda" title="wikilink"><em>Zvezda</em> module</a> of the International Space Station. The shuttle's small vernier jet thrusters were also fired during the mated operations to gather engineering data for 'reboosting' the ISS. After undocking, <em>Atlantis</em> performed a fly-around of <em>Mir</em>, leaving Linenger aboard the station for the most eventful Increment to date.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>During his Increment, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and in a non-American made spacesuit, performing the first test of the Russian-built <a href="Orlan_space_suits" title="wikilink">Orlan-M</a> spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut <a href="Vasili_Tsibliyev" title="wikilink">Vasili Tsibliyev</a>. All three crewmembers of expedition EO-23 also performed a &quot;fly-around&quot; in the Soyuz spacecraft, first undocking from one docking port of the station, then manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location. This made Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (Space Shuttle and Soyuz).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the Increment did not go smoothly, with Linenger and his Russian crewmates <a href="Vasily_Tsibliyev" title="wikilink">Vasily Tsibliyev</a> &amp; <a href="Alexandr_Kaleri" title="wikilink">Alexandr Kaleri</a> facing several difficulties including the most severe fire ever aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a backup oxygen-generating device), failures of various on board systems, a near collision with a <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress</a> resupply cargo ship during a long-distance manual docking system test and a total loss of station electrical power and, as a result, <a href="attitude_control" title="wikilink">attitude control</a>, resulting in a slow, uncontrolled &quot;tumble&quot; through space.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Linenger was eventually succeeded by <a href="Anglo-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-American</a> astronaut <a href="Michael_Foale" title="wikilink">Michael Foale</a>, carried up by <em>Atlantis</em> on <a href="STS-84" class="uri" title="wikilink">STS-84</a>, alongside Russian mission specialist <a href="Elena_Kondakova" title="wikilink">Elena Kondakova</a>. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to <em>Mir</em> was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit, especially important after the fire that had occurred on <a href="February_23" title="wikilink">February 23</a>. In addition, during undocking on <a href="May_21" title="wikilink">May 21</a>, the crew stopped <em>Atlantis</em> three times while backing away, to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of <a href="ESA" title="wikilink">ESA's</a> <a href="Automated_Transfer_Vehicle" title="wikilink">Automated Transfer Vehicle</a> (ATV) with the International Space Station.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Foale's Increment proceeded fairly normally until <a href="June_25" title="wikilink">June 25</a>, when during the second test of the <em>Progress</em> manual docking system, TORU, the resupply ship collided with solar arrays on the <em><a href="Spektr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spektr</a></em> module and crashed into the module's outer shell, holing the module and causing a depressurisation of the station, the first ever on-orbit depressurisation in the history of spaceflight. Only quick actions on the part of the crew, cutting cables leading to the module and closing <em>Spektr's</em>' hatch, prevented the crew abandoning the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilised the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in <em>Spektr</em>, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and remarkable salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community maximized the scientific return.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of <em>Spektr</em> and to attempt to locate the leak, <em>Mir's</em> new commander <a href="Anatoly_Solovyev" title="wikilink">Anatoly Solovyev</a> and <a href="flight_engineer" title="wikilink">flight engineer</a> <a href="Pavel_Vinogradov" title="wikilink">Pavel Vinogradov</a> carried out a risky salvage operation later in the mission, entering the empty module during a so-called &quot;IVA&quot; spacewalk, inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from <em>Spektr's</em> systems to the rest of the station. Following these first investigations, Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6-hour EVA on the surface of <em>Spektr</em> to inspect the damage to the punctured module.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>After the disasters, the US Congress and NASA considered whether the US should abandon the program out of concern for astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator <a href="Daniel_Goldin" title="wikilink">Daniel Goldin</a> decided to continue the program, with the next flight, <a href="STS-86" class="uri" title="wikilink">STS-86</a>, bringing Increment astronaut <a href="David_Wolf" title="wikilink">David Wolf</a> aboard <em>Mir</em>.</p>

</figure>
<p>STS-86 performed the seventh Shuttle-Mir docking, the last of 1997. During <em>Atlantis</em>'s stay crew members Titov and Parazynski conducted the first joint US-Russian extravehicular activity during a Shuttle mission, and the first in which a Russian wore a US spacesuit. During the 5-hour spacewalk on, the pair affixed a 121-pound Solar Array Cap to the <a href="Mir_Docking_Module" title="wikilink">Docking Module</a>, for a future attempt by crew members to seal off the leak in Spektr's hull. The mission returned Foale to Earth, along with samples, hardware, and an old Elektron oxygen generator, and dropped Wolf off on the Station ready for his 128 day Increment. Wolf had originally been scheduled to be the final <em>Mir</em> astronaut, but was chosen to go on the Increment instead of astronaut <a href="Wendy_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Wendy Lawrence</a>. Lawrence was deemed ineligible for flight due to a change in Russian requirements after the Progress supply vehicle collision. The new rules required that all <em>Mir</em> crew members should be trained and ready for spacewalks, but a Russian spacesuit suit could not be prepared for Lawrence in time for launch.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>The final year of Phase One began with the flight of <a href="Space_Shuttle_Endeavour" title="wikilink">Space Shuttle <em>Endeavour</em></a> on <a href="STS-89" class="uri" title="wikilink">STS-89</a>. The mission delivered Cosmonaut <a href="Salizhan_Sharipov" title="wikilink">Salizhan Sharipov</a> to <em>Mir</em> and replaced David Wolf with <a href="Andy_Thomas" title="wikilink">Andy Thomas</a>, following Wolf's 119 day Increment.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>During his Increment, the last of the program, Thomas worked on 27 science investigations the areas of advanced technology, <a href="Earth_science" title="wikilink">Earth sciences</a>, human life sciences, microgravity research, and ISS risk mitigation. His stay on <em>Mir</em>, considered the smoothest of the entire Phase One program, featured weekly &quot;Letters from the Outpost&quot; from Thomas and passed two milestones for length of spaceflight — 907 consecutive days in space by American astronauts since the launch of Shannon Lucid on the STS-76 mission in March 1996, and nearly 1000 days of occupancy by American astronauts dating back to Norman Thagard's trip to <em>Mir</em> in March 1995.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Thomas finally returned to Earth on the final Shuttle-Mir mission, <a href="STS-91" class="uri" title="wikilink">STS-91</a>. The mission closed out Phase One, with the EO-25 and STS-91 crews transferring water to <em>Mir</em> and exchanging almost 4700 pounds of cargo experiments and supplies between the two spacecraft. Long-term American experiments that had been on board <em>Mir</em> were also moved into <em>Discovery</em>', being stored within the shuttle's middeck lockers and Spacehab module. When the hatches closed for undocking at 9:07 a.m. EDT on <a href="June_8" title="wikilink">June 8</a> and the spacecraft separated at 12:01 p.m. EDT that day, the final set of Shuttle-Mir docked operations was concluded and Phase One of the International Space Station program came to an end.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

However, the techniques learned and equipment developed during the program would continue to assist in the development of space exploration with the beginning of Phase Two on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a> <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>. That day saw the launch of a Russian <a href="Proton_rocket" title="wikilink">Proton rocket</a> carrying the first module of the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">International Space Station</a>, the <a href="Zarya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zarya</a> Functional Cargo Block.

<p>As of December 2006, the International Space Station consists of six pressurised modules, two solar arrays &amp; a large truss structure, and is already the largest spacecraft assembled in history. The completion of the International Space Station will mark the end of Phase Two and the start of Phase Three. The completed station will consist of five laboratories and be able to support six crew members. With over 1000 <a href="cubic_metre" title="wikilink">cubic metres</a> of pressurised volume and a mass of 400,000 <a href="kilograms" class="uri" title="wikilink">kilograms</a> the completed station will be almost twice the size of the combined Shuttle-Mir spacecraft. Phases Two &amp; Three are intended to continue both international cooperation in space and zero-gravity scientific research, particularly regarding long-duration spaceflight. The results of this research will provide considerable information for long-duration expeditions to the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a> and flights to <a href="Mars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mars</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the intentional deorbiting of <em>Mir</em> on <a href="March_23" title="wikilink">March 23</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, the ISS became the only space station currently in orbit around Earth. <em>Mir</em>'s legacy lives on in the station, bringing together five space agencies in the cause of exploration and allowing those space agencies to prepare for their next leap into space, to the Moon, Mars and beyond.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<h3 id="safety-and-scientific-return">Safety and scientific return</h3>
<p>Throughout its course, the program received much criticism over the safety of the ageing <em>Mir</em>, particularly following the fire aboard the station and collision with the <em>Progress</em> supply vessel in 1997.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Linenger_in_Respirator.jpg" title=" Astronaut Jerry Linenger wearing a respirator mask following the 1997 fire aboard Mir." alt=" Astronaut Jerry Linenger wearing a respirator mask following the 1997 fire aboard Mir." width="250" /><figcaption> Astronaut <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a> wearing a respirator mask following the 1997 fire aboard <em>Mir</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The fire, caused by the malfunction of a backup <a href="Chemical_oxygen_generator#Solid_oxygen_generator_from_Mir" title="wikilink">solid-fuel oxygen generator</a> (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between ninety seconds &amp; fourteen minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around forty-five minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, which themselves also presented areas of concern, due to the fact that some of the respirator masks initially worn by the astronauts were broken. Of still further concern was the fact that <a href="fire_extinguisher" title="wikilink">fire extinguishers</a> fixed to the walls of the modules were found to be immovable. In addition, the fire occurred during a time when crews were switching over, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three — with the fire blocking off access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats. If evacuation of the station had been necessary, only half of the crew would have been able to escape. A similar occurrence had occurred on an earlier <em>Mir</em> expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The near-miss and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both were caused by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual docking system, which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive <a href="Kurs_(docking_system)" title="wikilink"><em>Kurs</em></a> automatic docking system from the Progress ships. The press at the time seized upon this untested technology as still further demonstrations of <em>Mir</em>'s unwieldiness.</p>
<p>The accidents also added to the increasingly vocal criticism of the dying station's reliability — originally designed to fly for five years, <em>Mir</em> eventually flew for three times that length of time. During the time of Phase One and afterward, the station was showing her age — constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes were an ever-present concern for crews. The air supply aboard the station also presented a cause for worry, due to various breakdowns of <em>Mir</em>'s Elektron oxygen-generating system. These breakdowns led crews to become increasingly reliant on the SFOG systems that had caused the fire in 1997, and continue to be a problem aboard the ISS, which uses the same system as part of its life-support equipment.<ref name="Dragonfly"></p>
<p>Another issue of controversy directed at the program was the scale of its actual scientific return, particularly following the loss of the <em>Spektr</em> science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program far outweighed the risks associated with it, especially considering the fact that most of the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, vastly reducing the science that could be performed above the station, rendering, in the eyes of the press, the program obsolete.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The safety issues at various times caused <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> to reconsider the future of the program, and, although it was eventually decided to continue, the agency came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="attitudes">Attitudes</h3>
<p>The attitudes of both the Russian space program and NASA towards Phase One was also of concern to the astronauts involved. Due to Russia's financial issues, it was considered by many at the <a href="Mission_Control_Center#FKA_Mission_Control_Center" title="wikilink">TsUP</a> that the mission hardware and continuation of <em>Mir</em> was of more importance than the lives of the cosmonauts aboard her, and as such the program was run in a very different way to the American style — cosmonauts found their days being planned for them down to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked upon return to Earth if they made any errors during their flights. Americans had found, in the past, notably aboard <em><a href="Skylab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skylab</a></em>, that this was not a productive way for work to be carried out, and had since made the plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, astronaut <a href="Jerry_Linenger" title="wikilink">Jerry Linenger</a> felt that, following the two accidents in 1997, the Russian authorities attempted a coverup of the accidents in an effort to downplay their significance, fearing that the Americans would back out of the partnership. A large part of this 'coverup' was the seeming impression that the American astronauts were not in fact 'partners' aboard the station, but were instead 'guests'. NASA staff did not find out for several hours about the fire and collision after they occurred, and found themselves kept out of decision-making processes. They eventually managed to get themselves involved when attributing the blame for the collision — Russian mission controllers had intended to place the accident entirely on the shoulders of <a href="Vasily_Tsibliyev" title="wikilink">Vasily Tsibliyev</a>, and it was only after the application of significant pressure from NASA that this stance was changed.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, NASA itself was not without flaws regarding Phase One — at various times during the program, managers and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and had a hard time getting anywhere with the NASA administration. One particular area of contention was the Director of the Flight Crew Operations Directorate, <a href="George_Abbey" title="wikilink">George Abbey</a>, who assigned crews to missions. He was despised by many astronauts in NASA due to his methods of choosing crews for flights — many found themselves grounded merely for upsetting him in some way. Astronauts felt that this prevented many of the best astronauts from flying in the roles they would be best suited to, and that the program as a whole suffered because of him.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="finances">Finances</h3>
<p>Another area of significant controversy regarding the program was the financial state of Russia's space program — since the <a href="breakup_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">breakup of the Soviet Union</a> a few years earlier, the <a href="Economy_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Russian economy</a> had been slowly collapsing, with the budget space exploration being reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from <a href="ESA" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and other countries, with one Japanese <a href="Television_station" title="wikilink">TV station</a> paying &lt;U+00A3&gt;6 million to have one of their reporters flown aboard <em>Mir</em>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> By the start of Phase One, the problem had become so bad that cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the <a href="Progress_spacecraft" title="wikilink">Progress</a> had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of <em>Mir</em> herself being sold, to the tune of around &lt;U+00A3&gt;350 million.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics argued that the &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 million contract NASA had with Russia was the only thing keeping the Russian space program alive, and only the Space Shuttle was keeping <em>Mir</em> aloft. Astronauts training at <a href="Star_City" title="wikilink">Star City</a> certainly got this impression, with NASA having to pay hefty fees for <a href="training_manual" title="wikilink">training manuals</a> and equipment.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Problems came to a head when it was revealed by <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <em>Nightline</em> that there was a distinct possibility of embezzlement of American finances by the Russian authorities in order to build a suite of new cosmonaut houses in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, or else that the building projects were being funded by the <a href="Russian_Mafia" title="wikilink">Russian Mafia</a>. NASA administrator Goldin was invited onto the programme to defend the homes, and refused to comment, although NASA's office for external affairs was quoted as saying that &quot;What Russia does with its own money is their business.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite these comments, however, NASA was unable to shake off the critics who claimed that the program was not a scientific endeavour at all — merely a political tool to assist the bankrupt Russian space program, an opinion which continues to this day with critics of Phase Two, the International Space Station herself.</p>
