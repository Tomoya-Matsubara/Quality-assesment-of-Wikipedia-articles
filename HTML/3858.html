<p><img src="England_878.svg" title="fig:England in the late ninth century|alt=Map of England in the late ninth century" alt="England in the late ninth century|alt=Map of England in the late ninth century" width="300" /> <strong>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold</strong> or <strong>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwald</strong> (died 902 or 903) was the younger of two known sons of <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred I</a>, King of <a href="Wessex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wessex</a> from 865 to 871. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred ended his reign fighting a Danish <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a> invasion. His sons were infants when he died, and he was succeeded by his younger brother, <a href="Alfred_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alfred the Great</a>, who carried on the war against the Vikings and won a crucial victory at the <a href="Battle_of_Edington" title="wikilink">Battle of Edington</a> in 878.</p>
<p>After Alfred's death in 899, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, <a href="Edward_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Edward the Elder</a>. As senior <a href="&lt;U+00E6&gt;theling" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E6&gt;theling</a> (prince of the royal dynasty eligible for kingship), &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold had a strong claim to the throne. He attempted to raise an army to support his claim, but was unable to get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled <a href="Northumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumbria</a>, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a>, where he was also accepted as king.</p>
<p>The following year &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold persuaded the East Anglian Danes to launch an attack on Edward's territory in Wessex and <a href="Mercia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercia</a>. Edward retaliated with a raid on <a href="Kingdom_of_East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglia</a>, and when he retreated the men of <a href="Kingdom_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Kent</a> lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Holme" title="wikilink">Battle of the Holme</a>. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses, including the death of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold, ending the challenge to Edward's rule.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the eighth century, <a href="Mercia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercia</a> was the most powerful kingdom in southern England, but in the early ninth <a href="Wessex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wessex</a> became dominant. In the 820s <a href="Egbert_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">King Egbert</a> of Wessex conquered south-east England (Kent, <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>, <a href="Kingdom_of_Sussex" title="wikilink">Sussex</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Essex" title="wikilink">Essex</a>). His reign saw the beginning of <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a> attacks, but Egbert and his son <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf</a>, who succeeded in 839, were able to resist them. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf died in 858, and he was followed by four sons in succession. <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald</a> died in 860, and <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht</a> in 865; &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's father, <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred</a>, then succeeded to the throne. In the same year the Viking <a href="Great_Heathen_Army" title="wikilink">Great Heathen Army</a> invaded England. Within five years they had conquered <a href="Northumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumbria</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglia</a>, and forced Mercia to buy them off. In late 870 the Vikings invaded Wessex, and in early 871 they fought armies under &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred and Alfred in four battles in quick succession, the last two of which Wessex lost. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred died shortly after Easter that year, leaving young sons. <a href="Primogeniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">Primogeniture</a> was not established in this period, and it was believed that kings should be adults, so he was succeeded by his younger brother <a href="Alfred_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alfred</a>.</p>
<p>By 878 the Vikings had seized eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred was reduced to being a fugitive in the <a href="Somerset_Levels" title="wikilink">Somerset marshes</a>, but he fought back and won the <a href="Battle_of_Edington" title="wikilink">Battle of Edington</a>. This was followed by a period of peace, and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a <a href="Treaty_of_Alfred_and_Guthrum" title="wikilink">treaty</a> with <a href="Guthrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guthrum</a>, king of the East Anglian Vikings, setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the one hand, and the <a href="Danelaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danelaw</a> on the other. A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Very little is known of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's family. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. His wife was probably the <a href="Wulfthryth_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">Wulfthryth</a> who witnessed a charter in 868. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold and his older brother <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelhelm" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelhelm</a> are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s. <img src="Alfred_the_Great&#39;s_will.jpg" title="fig:Page from the will of Alfred the Great. The top part, above the &#39;I&#39;, is the end of the preamble describing his councillors&#39; support against his nephews at Langandene. The will itself starts below the &#39;I&#39;.|alt=Page from the will of Alfred the Great" alt="Page from the will of Alfred the Great. The top part, above the &#39;I&#39;, is the end of the preamble describing his councillors&#39; support against his nephews at Langandene. The will itself starts below the &#39;I&#39;.|alt=Page from the will of Alfred the Great" /></p>
<p>After King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's death in 871, his sons' supporters complained that Alfred was keeping property that should have belonged to his nephews. He justified his conduct in a preamble to his will, which probably dates to the 880s, described by one of Alfred's biographers, Richard Abels, as &quot;rather tendentious&quot;, and another, <a href="Alfred_Smyth" title="wikilink">Alfred Smyth</a>, as &quot;ambiguous and vague &lt;U+2013&gt; and deliberately so&quot;. <a href="Patrick_Wormald" title="wikilink">Patrick Wormald</a> views the will as &quot;one of the seminal documents of pre-Conquest history, and like many such not easily understood.&quot;</p>
<p>The dispute concerned property bequeathed in the will of Alfred's father, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred and Alfred, stipulating that all of it was to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need to provide for their children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.</p>
<p>In the preamble to his will, Alfred stated:</p>
<dl>

<dd>When we now heard many disputes about the inheritance, I brought King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf's will to our assembly at <em>Langandene</em>, and it was read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me &lt;U+2013&gt; and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against any one of them because they declared what was right &lt;U+2013&gt; that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. &quot;Now everything has come into your possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Historians have taken differing views of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf's will. The editors of Alfred's will, <a href="Simon_Keynes" title="wikilink">Simon Keynes</a> and <a href="Michael_Lapidge" title="wikilink">Michael Lapidge</a>, suggest that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf's other surviving son, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, was excluded from the arrangement because he was provided for separately in the eastern kingdom (the recently conquered south-east England), where he acted as king in 855&lt;U+2212&gt;56; it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there. The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf's property. The transmission of <a href="Bookland_(law)#Controversies_over_folkland" title="wikilink">folkland</a> was governed by customary law, and another portion was reserved for the holder of the office of king. Keynes and Lapidge argue that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact, and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king, so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers. This plan was abandoned when &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald died in 860 and the kingdom was reunited under &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's confirmation of the arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised Alfred as <a href="heir_apparent" title="wikilink">heir apparent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Ann_Williams_(historian)" title="wikilink">Ann Williams</a> comments: &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred virtually disinherits his children in favour of Alfred's in the event of his own previous death, at least in respect of the lion's share of the inheritance and therefore the kingship. This is in fact exactly what happened, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's sons were not pleased at the outcome.&quot; In his <em>Life</em> of Alfred, written in 893, <a href="Asser" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asser</a> states three times that Alfred was &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's <em>secundarius</em> (heir apparent), an emphasis that in Ryan Lavelle's view &quot;reflects sensitivity on the subject of Alfred's succession&quot;.</p>
<p>Smyth argues, however, that it is unlikely that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf intended to divide his kingdom, or that the kingship of Wessex should be inherited by the surviving brother; the joint property was probably provision for his youngest sons at a time when they appeared very unlikely to succeed to the kingship, with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald included as a residual beneficiary in case both of them died young. D. P. Kirby argues that it cannot be assumed that the disputed lands represented the greater part of the royal estates; he believes that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf did intend to divide his kingdom, but also that it is unlikely he intended the surviving son to inherit the kingship: &quot;Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife. With three older brothers, Alfred's chances of reaching adulthood would, one feels, have been minimal.&quot;</p>
<p>In his own will, Alfred left the bulk of his property to <a href="Edward_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Edward</a>, while &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelhelm was left eight estates, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold only three at <a href="Godalming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Godalming</a> and <a href="Guildford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guildford</a> in Surrey, and <a href="Steyning" class="uri" title="wikilink">Steyning</a> in <a href="Sussex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sussex</a>, all in the less important eastern part of the kingdom. The largest of these was Steyning, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwulf's original burial place; in Patrick Wormald's view, Alfred may have moved the body to Winchester because he was required to give the estate to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold under his agreement with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred, and he did not want his nephew to have the prestige of owning his grandfather's grave. Keynes and Lapidge comment: &quot;If only to judge from the relatively small number of estates he received, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold in particular would have had cause to be aggrieved by this allocation of property, and his resentment is shown by his rebellion against Edward soon after Alfred's death.&quot; Smyth argues that the meeting of the king's council, the <a href="witan" class="uri" title="wikilink">witan</a>, was bound to support him:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Alfred, by [c.885] in full control of Wessex and at the height of his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the exclusion of his brother &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything tells he us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his <a href="thegn" title="wikilink">thegns</a>, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at all. That it did, suggests that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelhelm and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In Abels' view, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's sons attempted to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed so as to strengthen their position in the inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the <em>Langandene</em> assembly was Alfred's riposte.</p>
<p>Alfred also assisted his own son by promoting men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. However, in the view of <a href="Barbara_Yorke" title="wikilink">Barbara Yorke</a>, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as <em><a href="Queen_consort" title="wikilink">regina</a></em>, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold was still the senior <a href="&lt;U+00E6&gt;theling" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E6&gt;theling</a>, and in the only surviving charter he witnessed, both he and Edward are shown as <em>filius regis</em> (son of a king), but he is listed above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.</p>
<h2 id="u00c6thelwolds-revolt">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's Revolt</h2>

<p>After Alfred's death in 899, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold made a bid for the throne. <a href="Janet_Nelson" title="wikilink">Janet Nelson</a> comments that &quot;in the eyes of many Englishmen as well as Scandinavians this &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling had claims stronger than Edward's own.&quot; According to the 'A' version of the <em><a href="Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></em>, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold abducted a nun from her convent without the permission of King Edward and against the command of the bishop. Her identity is not known, but it must have been intended to strengthen his claim, and in the view of the historian <a href="Pauline_Stafford" title="wikilink">Pauline Stafford</a>, the <em>Chronicle's</em> account is biased in favour of Edward and may have been intended to delegitimise a politically important marriage. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold took her to the royal manors of Twynham (now <a href="Christchurch,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Christchurch</a>) and then <a href="Wimborne_Minster_(church)" title="wikilink">Wimborne Minster</a>, symbolically important as his father's burial place, and declared that &quot;he would live or die there&quot;. Lavelle sees Wimborne as strategically significant, close to Roman roads to <a href="Dorchester,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Dorchester</a> and <a href="Salisbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salisbury</a>, and at a crossing point of the rivers <a href="River_Allen,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Allen</a> and <a href="River_Stour,_Dorset" title="wikilink">Stour</a>; it was the most southern point for control of access to western Wessex and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold may have intended a division of the kingdom.</p>
<p>However, when Edward's army approached and camped at <a href="Badbury_Rings" title="wikilink">Badbury Rings</a>, an <a href="British_Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill_fort" title="wikilink">hill fort</a> four miles west of Wimborne, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold was unable to gain sufficient support to meet them in battle. Leaving behind his consort, he fled to the <a href="Danes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danes</a> of Northumbria, who accepted him as king. Northumbrian coins were issued at this time in the name of a king called 'Alwaldus', who is thought to have been &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold. Norse sagas record traditions of a Danish king Kn&lt;U+00FA&gt;tr, who briefly ruled Northumbria around 900. He is said to have been at first been repulsed by an English king called Adalbrigt north of <a href="Cleveland,_England" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, but then to have defeated him at <a href="Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Scarborough</a>. In 1987, Smyth suggested that Adalbrigt may have been &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold, but in 1995 Smyth put forward the alternative idea that the Northumbrian Danes may have accepted &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's claim to be king of the West Saxons rather than taking him as their own king.</p>
<p>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's reign in Northumbria was short, in <a href="David_Rollason" title="wikilink">David Rollason</a>'s view because &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold saw it only as a base for gaining power in Wessex. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a>, where Rollason states that he was accepted as king by the local Vikings. However, <a href="David_Dumville" title="wikilink">David Dumville</a> points out that in the next year &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold persuaded the Danes in East Anglia to wage war against Edward, and Dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate Viking army in Essex. In his view &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of the kingdom of Wessex in order to strengthen his claim to the throne, and he succeeded in gaining the submission of the English rulers of Essex.</p>
<p>The East Anglian Danes joined &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold in a raid on Mercia, reaching as far as the fortified <a href="burh" class="uri" title="wikilink">burh</a> at <a href="Cricklade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cricklade</a> on the border with Wessex. He then crossed the <a href="Thames" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thames</a> into Wessex itself to raid <a href="Braydon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braydon</a>. Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia, but he withdrew without engaging &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold in battle. The men of <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> lingered, although according to the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> Edward sent seven messengers to recall them. The Danes caught up with the men of Kent to fight the <a href="Battle_of_the_Holme" title="wikilink">Battle of the Holme</a>. Its location is unknown but may be <a href="Holme,_Cambridgeshire" title="wikilink">Holme</a> in <a href="Cambridgeshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire</a>. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold was among the leaders on the Danish side who were killed, together with <a href="Eohric_of_East_Anglia" title="wikilink">Eohric</a>, the Viking King of East Anglia, two <a href="Hold_(title)" title="wikilink">holds</a> (Danish noblemen), Ysopa and Oscetel, and Beorhtsige, son of the &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling Beornoth, who was probably a kinsmen of the former king of Mercia, <a href="Burgred" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burgred</a>. Kentish losses included their two <a href="ealdorman" title="wikilink">ealdormen</a>, Sigewulf and Sigehelm, and an Abbot Cenwulf.</p>
<p>The achievement of the Kentish contingent put Edward's failure to engage the Danes with his whole army in a poor light. In Cyril Hart's view: &quot;Undoubtedly there were recriminations, which appear to have continued to threaten Edward's authority for some considerable period, especially in Kent; witness the Wessex chronicler's anxiety to find excuses for Edward's failure to support the Kentish contingent.&quot; Edward was later to marry Sigehelm's daughter, <a href="Eadgifu_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Eadgifu</a>, and Hart thinks that this may have been designed to placate his Kentish subjects.</p>
<p>The various texts of the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> give different versions of the revolt. Hart states: &quot;The oldest and more authoritative is preserved in the 'B' text of the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> (supported in its essentials by the Latin East Anglian <em>Chronicle</em>); the official version in the 'A' text is clearly a late revision, intended to justify King Edward's position and to reinforce his authority.&quot; 'B' describes &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold as an &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling, indicating the legitimacy of his claim for the kingship, a description omitted in 'A'. 'A' says that he took possession of Wimborne and Twinham without the permission of the king and his councillors', 'B' against their will. 'B' says that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold &quot;rode away by night&quot; from Wimborne; 'A' reads &quot;stole away&quot;. According to 'B', the Northumbrian Danes accepted &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold as their king, and gave allegiance to him, but this is omitted in 'A'. However, none of the texts describe him as an &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling after his flight to Northumbria, showing that his actions were no longer thought to have a claim to legitimacy. In the view of Scott Thompson Smith, the dispute was over property as well as kingship, and the <em>Chronicle</em> presents Edward as the successful protector of family property against outside interests.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>According to the historian Martin Ryan:</p>
<dl>

<dd>What is striking about &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's &quot;rebellion&quot; is the level and range of support he was able to draw on: he could call on allies from Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia and, probably, Mercia and Essex. For a time &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold had a claim to be the most powerful ruler in England. Edward's apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the view of James Campbell, the bias in the sources has led historians to see &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's rebellion as a &quot;somewhat odd episode&quot;, but he had a justifiable claim to the kingship, and he was nearly successful; if he had not been killed at the Holme, he might have united England with much less warfare than ultimately proved to be necessary. &quot;Had it not been for the chances of battle and war &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold might very well have been regarded as one of the greatest figures in our island's story&quot;. Lavelle argues that &quot;it is important to acknowledge the audacity of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's actions&quot; and that he &quot;well deserves to be ranked amongst the 'Nearly Men' of early Medieval Europe&quot;. The twelfth-century <a href="Annals_of_St_Neots" title="wikilink">Annals of St Neots</a> called him &quot;king of the pagans&quot;.</p>
<p>It is not known whether he had any descendants, but the chronicler <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard_(historian)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard</a> claimed descent from King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred, and this may have been through &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold. Shashi Jayakumar suggests the rivalry between King <a href="Eadwig" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eadwig</a> and his younger brother <a href="Edgar_the_Peaceful" title="wikilink">Edgar</a> in the 950s dates back to the conflict which resulted in the Battle of the Holme. Eadwig's wife, <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfgifu,_wife_of_Eadwig" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfgifu</a>, was probably &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard's sister, and one of Eadwig's supporters, Byrhtnoth, may have been descended from the Mercian royal family through the &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling Beorhtnoth, whose son Byrhtsige died fighting on &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold's side at the Holme. Opponents of Eadwig included his grandmother, Eadgifu, and Eadwig confiscated her property. In Jayakumar's view: &quot;The emergence of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfgifu, descendant of the &lt;U+00E6&gt;theling &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold, did not just threaten Edgar's position, it represented a <em>revanche</em> to a line and lineage with royal claims of its own ... The ancestors of Byrhtnoth and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard had in all likelihood fought together with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold on the <em>Danish</em> side at the Battle of the Holme, the opposite side to that which Eadgifu's father Sigehelm had fought for.&quot; The marriage between Eadwig and &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfgifu was dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity, and Edgar succeeded to the throne when Eadwig died without leaving children. In the view of Nick Higham, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard shows a &quot;lack of empathy&quot; for Edward in his chronicle, which Higham attributes to Edward's victory over &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard's ancestor. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century, showing that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred's descendants held on to land and power in the century after his death. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelweard's grandson, <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelnoth_(archbishop_of_Canterbury)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelnoth</a>, was an eleventh-century <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.</p>
