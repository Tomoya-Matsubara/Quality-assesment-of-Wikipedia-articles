<p><strong>Mileena</strong> is a <a href="player_character" title="wikilink">player</a> and a one-time <a href="Boss_(video_gaming)" title="wikilink">boss</a> character from the <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat</a></em> series of <a href="fighting_game" title="wikilink">fighting video games</a>. Mileena was originally known as an <a href="assassination" title="wikilink">assassin</a> in service of the Outworld's evil emperor <a href="Shao_Kahn" title="wikilink">Shao Kahn</a> and an <a href="evil_twin" title="wikilink">evil twin</a> sister of his stepdaughter <a href="Kitana_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Princess Kitana</a> but is later revealed to be a deformed <a href="cloning" title="wikilink">clone</a> of her, created by the sorcerer <a href="Shang_Tsung" title="wikilink">Shang Tsung</a>.</p>
<p>Mileena's personality is usually defined by her fierce rivalry with Kitana and lust for power. Since her introduction as Kitana's <a href="palette_swap" title="wikilink">palette swap</a> character in <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat_II" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> in 1993, Mileena gained significant popularity, becoming one of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>{{'}}s most iconic characters, used in the promotion of later games as a designated <a href="sex_symbol" title="wikilink">sex symbol</a> and was a central character of <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Deception" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></em>. However, her appearances in the various other media in the franchise have been relatively rare and minor as compared to these of Kitana.</p>
<p>The character received a mixed&lt;U+2014&gt;mostly due to the remarkable dualism of her character design&lt;U+2014&gt;but generally favorable critical reception.</p>

<p>After the ruler of the other dimensional realm Outworld, <a href="Shao_Kahn" title="wikilink">Shao Kahn</a>, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter <a href="Kitana_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Kitana</a> alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered <a href="Shang_Tsung" title="wikilink">Shang Tsung</a> to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from <a href="Baraka_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Baraka</a>'s race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena would be used to spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and personal assassins, though Mileena (who has became a companion of Baraka) privately grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As Kahn feared, Kitana did finally find the truth about her past and so Mileena was ordered to keep close watch over her rival when Kitana secretly allied with Earthrealm warriors during the events of <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat_II" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> (1993).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mileena, determined to stop her twin at any cost,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is then murdered<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> by Kitana, her soul descending into the Netherrealm. In <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Shaolin_Monks" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</a></em> (2005), the <a href="beat&#39;em_up" title="wikilink">beat'em up</a> retelling of <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, Mileena (voiced by Lita Lopez) fights against <a href="Liu_Kang" title="wikilink">Liu Kang</a> and <a href="Kung_Lao" title="wikilink">Kung Lao</a> alongside <a href="Jade_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Jade</a> and Kitana, but is defeated by the two Shaolin warriors and flees to the Wasteland to seek help from <a href="Goro_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Goro</a>. Damned to the Netherrealm after her death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Shinnok" title="wikilink">Shinnok</a>. During the events of <em><a href="Ultimate_Mortal_Kombat_3" title="wikilink">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a></em> (1996), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically granting her the ability to read Kitana's thoughts.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Shinnok sees this as an opportunity to covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherrealm. In <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat_4#Mortal_Kombat_Gold" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat Gold</a></em> (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana' palace and demands the power over Edenia to be shared with her but Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena, locking her away in a dungeon.</p>
<p>Mileena remains imprisoned for years, until <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Onaga" title="wikilink">Onaga</a> the Dragon King began his own invasion of Edenia, during which she is freed from her imprisonment by her ally Baraka. During the events of <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Deception" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></em> (2004), Mileena (voiced by Johanna A&lt;U+00F1&gt;onuevo) is ordered by Onaga to pose as Kitana in order to confuse and misdirect his enemies.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, as Mileena begins the game's titular deception, she develops a hidden agenda and decides to take control of both the forces of Edenia and Onaga's own undead army for herself. In the game's story mode (Konquest), Mileena also trains the young <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Shujinko" title="wikilink">Shujinko</a> in the Outworld and fights against Jade.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</a></em> (2006), Mileena seizes Shao Kahn's fortress, still under the guise of Kitana, and decides to continue her charade until the Edenian forces were corrupted enough to follow her under the true identity. Though at first confident that Outworld is hers to rule, Mileena is forced to reveal herself and surrender to the returning Shao Kahn when he mounts an offensive against the fortress to re-instate his rule over Outworld. The emperor then commands her to capture Shujinko, who would be used as a bargaining chip in gaining Onaga as an ally. Mileena, pretending to be Kitana, succeeds in capturing Shujinko, taking him to Shao Kahn's palace. But having tasted power for herself, she is no longer content with being his minion and still plans to get the throne of Edenia back for herself. She is later killed by Shang Tsung during the final all-out battle at the Soulnado.</p>
<p>Mileena returns in <a href="Mortal_Kombat_(2011_video_game)" title="wikilink"><em>Mortal Kombat</em> (2011)</a>, an alternative-timeline retelling of the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> trilogy that brought some major changes to her character. In this game, Mileena (voiced by <a href="Karen_Strassman" title="wikilink">Karen Strassman</a>, who was also hired for the next sequel<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>) was created by Shang Tsung in the &quot;Flesh Pit&quot; and introduced during the second tournament, instead of many years earlier. Meant to be a loyal replacement for Kitana, she is physically and mentally damaged, her animalistic rage controlled only by Shao Kahn as she uses her lascivious behavior to lure victims and then slaughter and devour them.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the game's story mode, she serves as an opponent for Kitana, Jade, <a href="Kurtis_Stryker" title="wikilink">Kurtis Stryker</a> and <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Kabal" title="wikilink">Kabal</a>, and is referred to by Shao Kahn as his &quot;true daughter&quot;; when Kahn appaers to be killed, his minions even discuss making her a new ruler of Outworld. Her new personality is much more immature (even <a href="Infantilism_(physiological_disorder)" title="wikilink">infantile</a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>) than in the previous games, and even Kitana (in her uncanonical ending) is shown to be an unusually sympathic towards her.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Mileena was the first evil <a href="Portrayal_of_women_in_video_games" title="wikilink">female character</a> to appear in the series, created and initially developed by <a href="John_Tobias" title="wikilink">John Tobias</a>.

Only in <em>Mortal Kombat Gold</em> she uses also a European style <a href="longsword" class="uri" title="wikilink">longsword</a> (Scorpion's weapon in the both versions of <em>Mortal Kombat 4</em>). Mileena's <a href="Fatality_(Mortal_Kombat)#Animality" title="wikilink">Animality</a> in <em>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</em> has her transforming into a small <a href="skunk" class="uri" title="wikilink">skunk</a>.</p>

<p>Physically, Mileena is largely identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (they got noticeably downsized for <em>Deception</em> and <em>Armageddon</em>). Boon described Mileena as &quot;Anti-Kitana&quot; and said that her large &quot;sharp, nasty teeth&quot; have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous <a href="Fatality_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Fatality</a> &quot;<a href="man-eater" title="wikilink">Man-Eater</a>&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> (featured in <em>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</em>, too),<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> in which she sucks up the entire body of their victims and then spits out their clean bones.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until <em>Mortal Kombat 2011</em> (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head),<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> with a sole exception of one Fatality in <em>Deception</em> in which she tears off the opponent's head with them. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in <em>Mortal Kombat Gold</em> (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> and pinned back in <em>Ultimate MK3</em>), Mileena's always-black hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a <a href="ponytail" class="uri" title="wikilink">ponytail</a>. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As a supposed twin sister, she shared Kitana's eyes in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>; her eyes then became &quot;undead&quot; all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion) in <em>Ultimate MK3</em>. In <em>Deception</em>, <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Shaolin Monks</em>, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In <em>Mortal Kombat 2011</em>, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate <em>Ultimate MK3</em> style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a <a href="downloadable_content" title="wikilink">downloadable content</a> package<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>) in which she has human eyes once again.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Just like Kitana and Jade, Mileena was originally portrayed by <a href="Katalin_Zamiar" title="wikilink">Katalin Zamiar</a> in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, Becky Gable taking over the role in <em>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</em>. Mileena's main color has been either a shade of <a href="purple" class="uri" title="wikilink">purple</a> or <a href="magenta" class="uri" title="wikilink">magenta</a> in various installments (including when masquerading as Kitana in <em>Deception</em>) and their outfits did not differ in a significant way (more than just having different color patterns) until <em>Mortal Kombat Gold</em>. Since then, her costumes have been generally getting more skimpy with every new game,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> including always having an exposed midriff since <em>Deception</em> (Steve Beran, character designer for this game, said: &quot;I wanted to give Mileena an <a href="Arabian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> feel to her costume and the final version showed a lot more skin and her mask developed into more of a veil.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>). Mileena's main costume in <em>Deception</em> and <em>Armageddon</em> is actually mostly black and features long flowing arm sleeves, a back-only <a href="loincloth" class="uri" title="wikilink">loincloth</a> and a partially transparent veil. In <em>Shaolin Monks</em>, Mileena appears half-naked (her costume made largely of just belts of leather and scraps of fabric), barefoot (with a bandaged midfoot) and again wearing a veil in place of a mask (the veil also returns as part of her formal outfit in <em>Mortal Kombat 2011</em>). In the 2011 reboot game, her prime costume is based on her famous provocative alternate from <em>Deception</em>, but more detailed and again featuring a mask. In all, in this game she has the largest number of costumes out of all characters in the entire series. Her &quot;Flesh Pit&quot; alternate costume in 2011 game is made of just some loose bandages put around her otherwise completely naked body,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> marking the first time that she has appeared unmasked by default. {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
<p>Mileena is a hidden playable character in <em>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</em>, in which she needs to be unlocked using a special &quot;Kombat Kode&quot;,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> but is available from the start in the compilation game <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat_Trilogy" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></em> (appearing as seen in <em>Ultimate MK3</em>). She is not playable in <em>Shaolin Monks</em>, but she appears as a sub-<a href="Boss_(video_gaming)" title="wikilink">boss</a> character alongside Kitana and Jade (as well as an optional boss in a secret stage encounter). Mileena also appears in the <a href="super_deformed" title="wikilink">super deformed</a>-style &quot;cute&quot; form in every <a href="minigame" class="uri" title="wikilink">minigame</a> through the series (&quot;Chess Kombat&quot;, &quot;Puzzle Kombat&quot; and &quot;Motor Kombat&quot;). She utilises sai in most of her Fatalities, including to immobilize her opponents during the killing sequence, and in some of them she pretends to kiss her victims.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> There was a popular but completely false urban legend regarding a supposed &quot;Nudality&quot; finishing move in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Mileena was sometimes seen as the best character of <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>. According to <em><a href="GamePro" class="uri" title="wikilink">GamePro</a></em>'s official strategy guide, while <a href="Jax_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Jax</a> is the best overall fighter in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, Mileena's &quot;massive advantage&quot; over him made her an ultimate &quot;queen of the hill&quot; (&quot;with her rapid sai-throwing ability, <a href="Teleportation" title="wikilink">teleport</a> attacks, and deadly <a href="Combo_(video_gaming)" title="wikilink">combos</a>, this beautiful assassin lands atop our ratings&quot;); in their test, Mileena was especially effective against Jax, <a href="Reptile_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Reptile</a> and Shang Tsung (<em><a href="Amiga_Format" title="wikilink">Amiga Format</a></em> similarily noted that she and Kitana were always &quot;so much faster&quot; that &quot;poor Jax [...] ended getting his head kicked in every time&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> She was also ranked as the game's best overall fighter by <em><a href="Sega_Visions" title="wikilink">Sega Visions</a></em> for her high speed and reach, and her teleport kick that can dodge projectiles.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> According to <em><a href="CU_Amiga" title="wikilink">CU Amiga</a></em>, Mileena was &quot;third only to Jax and Liu Kang for sheer brilliance,&quot; being a &quot;somewhat misleading character&quot; whose moves need to be &quot;learnt the right way to put them all together to be devastating.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> According to <em><a href="Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" title="wikilink">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em>, this &quot;deadly woman [...] can hold her own against any man in the game&quot; and her players can use her &quot;lightning speed&quot; and the sai blasts to overcome other players.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <em><a href="Computer_and_Video_Games" title="wikilink">C+VG</a></em> wrote that all of <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> characters are &quot;well-balanced&quot; and &quot;potentially excellent&quot;, but still the teleport kick of the &quot;very fast&quot; Mileena was singled out as &quot;the best surprising move in the game.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> However, according to <em><a href="Nintendo_Power" title="wikilink">Nintendo Power</a></em>, Mileena's original powers &quot;may prove insufficient&quot; for using her with same effectiveness in <em>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</em>, where most of the other characters got some additional special moves.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em><a href="Sega_Saturn_Magazine" title="wikilink">Sega Saturn Magazine</a></em> wrote that &quot;she's pretty much identical to the last time.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> On the other hand, <em>Total 64</em> wrote that in <em>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em> Mileena is &quot;a damn good fighter, has got plenty of powerful moves&quot; and is &quot;an all round classy fighting star!&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="GameSpy" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpy</a>'s guide to <em>Deception</em>, in this game Mileena &quot;has some solid offensive tools&quot; and &quot;a few solid combos up her sleeve, as well as a few pop-up attacks that are extremely quick and open up brief juggle opportunities,&quot; her weaknesses being a very short range of her sai and having relatively very few ranged attacks in general.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> According to <a href="Prima_Games" title="wikilink">Prima Games</a>' official guide for <em>Armageddon</em>, Mileena (rated overall 6/10) is a &quot;punisher&quot; type character and a better fighter than Kitana (&quot;seems to have the upper hand between the two&quot;), but while she &quot;is able to punish from any range and even interrupt high attacks and projectiles, the damage she inflicts is minor.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> According to Prima's official guide for the 2011's <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, Mileena is well-balanced and universal, displaying neither particular weaknesses nor adventages that would result in a one-sided battle against anyone else, and always winning around half of fights against different characters (40-60%, depending on a character).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Mileena was one of the minor characters featured in <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Live_Tour" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Live Tour</a></em> stage show in 1995, played by Jennifer DeCosta. She also appeared as a minor recurring character in <a href="Mortal_Kombat_(comics)" title="wikilink">Malibu's <em>Mortal Kombat</em> comic books</a> published in 1994-1995. In the comics, Mileena first appeared in the comic miniseries <em>Goro: Prince of Pain</em> as part of a team led by Kitana with orders to find the missing Goro in Outworld. She is shown having reservations about Kitana's true loyalty (though she never speaks about it to anyone) and considers herself to be &quot;Shao Kahn's true daughter&quot;. Mileena duels <a href="Sonya_Blade" title="wikilink">Sonya Blade</a> twice, losing both times. She was also featured in a one-shot special entitled <em>Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act</em>, which explained their past: Mileena is shown in this comic as a creation ordered by Shao Kahn, though he would never let her replace Kitana.</p>

Dana Hee described her role as &quot;an evil, mysterious figure that leaves you wondering, 'Who is she?'&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Despite being a trainer and stunt double for Kitana's actress <a href="Talisa_Soto" title="wikilink">Talisa Soto</a> in both of <em>Mortal Kombat</em> films,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Hee had her own stunt double for that scene.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Hee was also a stunt double for three other <em>Annihilation</em> actresses and <a href="Kristanna_Loken" title="wikilink">Kristanna Loken</a> (Taja) in <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Konquest" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Konquest</a></em>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Mileena's name was never even mentioned in the film and only appears during the end credits. Her pink-and-black costume is a palette swap of Kitana's main film attire (a sleeveless corset-like shirt and pants) with an added mouth mask and has blue eyes. Mileena has only one spoken line in the film (&quot;You wish&quot; in response to the question of &quot;Kitana?&quot;) and it was the only time she has ever been shown with a <a href="braid" title="wikilink">braided</a> hair, similar to Kitana's film hairstyle. In <em>Mortal Kombat II: Annihilation</em>, the film's novelization penned by Jerome Preisler, Mileena's scene was changed and her looks are different, but she is also killed in a fight when attacking Sonya.</p>
<p>Mileena appeared in the 1999 episode &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; of the television series <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Konquest" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Konquest</a></em>, in which she had no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his &quot;new daughter&quot;). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung to not do it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth even more exaggerated and pointy. She then starts to wear her signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In <em>Konquest</em>, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and <a href="Audie_England" title="wikilink">Audie England</a> played Mileena pretending to be Kitana.</p>
<p>Another alternative and younger version of Mileena appears in the 2011 live-action webisode miniseries <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Legacy" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Legacy</a></em>,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> portrayed by the martial artist and debuting actress Jolene Tran.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Their story is told in the two-part animated/live episode &quot;Kitana &amp; Mileena&quot;,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> during which Mileena is shown to be a Shang Tsung-created clone like in the games, but of the age more similar to Kitana's, as they were together since they both were infants, and her scarred but otherwise normal-looking mouth (with lips, except when she has been a baby<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>) changes as her teeth grow when she becomes overcomed by a cannibalistic rage. In <em>Legacy</em>, the adolescent Mileena is clad in violet, does not appear to be Kitana's twin and is seen wearing a mask only in some of the animated sections (in which both of them are wearing outfits similar to these worn by them in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>). She is shown spar-dueling against Kitana and losing to her, and killing and devouring a palace guard in a fit of insanity, as well as killing impostors of King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father, in a team together with Kitana. When the two are eventually sent by Shao Kahn on a mission to assassinate a man who is really King Jerrod, she kills hims with a double sai throw to the chest when he was talking to Kitana. The episode was nominated by the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America_Award" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America Award</a> in the category &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Writing Derivative New Media&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Mileena was confirmed to return for the second season of <em>Legacy</em>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> {{-}}</p>

<p>Mileena's addition to the series was well received and she quickly became one of the most popular and recognizable <em>Mortal Kombat</em> characters. Her debut appearance in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> was met with a favorable critical reception: <em><a href="The_Miami_Herald" title="wikilink">The Miami Herald</a></em> called Kitana and Mileena, &quot;leggy ladies who wear masks&quot;, to be &quot;an interesting step toward <a href="political_correctness" title="wikilink">political correctness</a>&quot; as &quot;a far cry from <a href="Little_Miss_Muffet" title="wikilink">Little Miss Muffet</a>,&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> <em><a href="Austin_American-Statesman" title="wikilink">Austin American-Statesman</a></em> said they are &quot;far nastier than <a href="Sonya_Blade" title="wikilink">that martial-artless aerobics instructor</a> from the <a href="Mortal_Kombat_(1992_video_game)" title="wikilink">first game</a>,&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> while <em><a href="Nintendo_Power" title="wikilink">Nintendo Power</a></em> called her &quot;beautiful, graceful, beguiling and strong, but most of all, deadly&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and &quot;a dangerous enemy: cruel, cold and calculating.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In 2009, <a href="UGO_Networks" title="wikilink">UGO</a> ranked Mileena as fifth on their top list of <em>Mortal Kombat</em> characters, citing her at that time rare presence as an evil female player character (a <a href="taboo" class="uri" title="wikilink">taboo</a>-breaking novelty in video games in 1993) and adding that her brutal attacks, revealing outfits and <a href="slut" title="wikilink">slutty</a> attitude made her a fan favorite,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> while <em><a href="FHM" class="uri" title="wikilink">FHM</a></em> listed her among the nine sexiest &quot;bad girls of videogame land&quot;, adding that &quot;perhaps no one is as menacing as Mileena.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> <em><a href="Complex_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Complex</a></em> made her share the eighth place with Kitana and Sonya on the list of &quot;hottest women in video games&quot; in 2010,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a>, also ranking her alone as eight in the 2011 list of the &quot;most diabolical video game she-villains&quot;.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> In 2011, <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> listed Mileena as one of the series' &quot;four main characters&quot; alongside Liu Kang, Scorpion and Sub-Zero (&quot;at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled to the brim with dagger-like teeth&quot;),<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> <a href="Bright_Hub" title="wikilink">Bright Hub</a> included her among the &quot;top ten awesome&quot; <em>Mortal Kombat</em> characters as well as well as one of the sexiest (&quot;second only to the gorgeous Kitana&quot;),<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and <a href="CraveOnline" class="uri" title="wikilink">CraveOnline</a> stated she is &quot;without question&quot; one of the &quot;most beloved&quot; characters in the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> universe.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> That same year, Polish web portal <a href="Wirtualna_Polska" title="wikilink">Wirtualna Polska</a> featured Millena among the top ten villainesses in gaming, describing her as &quot;absolutely phenomenal, simply dripping with sex&quot; but advising to skip trying to check under her mask,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> while an American model Tara Babcock ranked her as the 11th &quot;hottest video game babe&quot;, adding that in the reboot game &quot;Mileena embodies a childish character through her fighting style and behavior.&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Also in 2011, Mileena's breasts were ranked as the 31st and ninth finest in gaming by <a href="GameFront" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameFront</a> and <em>Complex</em>, respectively.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

In 1994, she was one of the characters cited by <a href="Guy_Aoki" title="wikilink">Guy Aoki</a> as allegedly perpetuating existing <a href="Stereotypes_of_East_Asians_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">stereotypes of Asians</a> as martial arts experts.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed Mileena as one of &quot;top 50 chicks behaving badly&quot;, adding that her &quot;face only a (Tarkatan) mother could love&quot; does nothing &quot;to diminish her wicked demeanor and actions&quot; (&quot;just call her Mileen-ewwwwww&quot;).<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> That same year, Destructoid's Brad Nicholson called her &quot;the worst character ever created in a fighting game,&quot; without elaborating.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> In 2010, <em><a href="Game_Informer" title="wikilink">Game Informer</a></em> included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by them in the future <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> also describing her in the 2011 game as &quot;as creepy as ever&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> <a href="PlayStation_Universe" title="wikilink">PlayStation Universe</a> wrote, &quot;as for the date theme [in the trailer], frankly we can&lt;U+2019&gt;t really see the appeal &lt;U+2013&gt; she&lt;U+2019&gt;s not a patch on <a href="Sheeva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sheeva</a>, after all.&quot;<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> <a href="Joystiq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joystiq</a> wrote that instead of &quot;focusing on her fighting style, or assets,&quot; they simply could not &quot;get past one thing: how does she pronounce the letter P without touching her lips together?&quot;<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Destructoid's Nick Chester commented, &quot;Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist.&quot;<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> When an American radio host <a href="Howard_Stern" title="wikilink">Howard Stern</a> mocked a fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, <em>Game Informer</em> commented that it was &quot;honestly insane&quot; as &quot;onanism and Mileena should not mix.&quot;<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> IGN featured the unmasked Mileena on the list of the worst dressed video game characters of 2011, adding that &quot;the term 'butter face' doesn't even begin to describe this nightmare,&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> and <a href="io9" class="uri" title="wikilink">io9</a> listed her outfit among 2011's &quot;sluttiest and weirdest&quot; store-bought Halloween costumes.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> In 2012, <a href="MMGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">MMGN</a>'s Nathan Misa wrote while talking about &quot;outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games&quot;, &quot;Look, I like <a href="Lara_Croft" title="wikilink">Lara Croft</a>'s booty shorts or Mileena's two... deadly sais as much as every other guy, but why not have more than virtual <a href="Polygon_(computer_graphics)" title="wikilink">polygons</a> to ogle at?&quot;<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p><small></p>
<dl>

<dd>1. Her name is variably pronounced as either &quot;Ma-lee-na&quot; (<em>Mortal Kombat II</em> to <em>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em>) or &quot;Mi-lee-na&quot; (later games) through the series. Her name appears to be a form of East European first name <a href="Milena_(name)" title="wikilink">Milena</a>, which is derived from a <a href="Slavic_languages" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> word that means &quot;gracious&quot; in English.
</dd>
<dd>2. Another, optional secret stage<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> encounter against Mileena ends with her tossing Kitana into a portal and then following after her, where they presumably fought to the death. In the game, Mileena shares her Fatality with Jade, while Liu Kang uncanonically kills Jade by stabbing her in the eyes with Mileena's sai.
</dd>
<dd>3. In Mileena's uncanonical ending in <em>Armageddon</em>, she defeats <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Blaze" title="wikilink">Blaze</a>, causing herself and Kitana to fuse together momentarily. When separated, Mileena finds that she has taken Kitana's facial features, while Kitana has been cursed with Mileena's Tarkatan jaw visage. Mileena is now able to take her &quot;rightful&quot; place as princess of Edenia and rules in Kitana's place, locking her sister away in the Edenian palace dungeon, where she eventually goes insane.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a>
</dd>
<dd>4. Curiously, Mileena's sai are clearly dull-pointed in much of the non-gameplay parts of <em>Deception</em>, including the intro sequence and the VS screen picture. This is actually a more realistic depiction, as (contrary to a popular opinion and many appearances in pop culture) the traditional sai is a blunt, round-pointed melee weapon that was not designed for neither stabbing or cutting, and which thus can be used well for non-lethal combat. Another <em>Mortal Kombat</em> character using sai is <a href="List_of_Mortal_Kombat_characters#Li_Mei" title="wikilink">Li Mei</a>, introduced in <em><a href="Mortal_Kombat:_Deadly_Alliance" title="wikilink">Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</a></em> in place of Mileena who was the absent from the game due to being imprisoned.
</dd>
<dd>5. Two concept pictures<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> for Mileena's design in <em>Deception</em> by Steve Beran were included in the game's bonus gallery &quot;The Krypt&quot;. According to the original caption, one of them was originally supposed to be Kitana, but was developed into the primary Mileena costume, while the other one became Mileena's alternate.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Another publicly released early concept art,<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> created for <em>Shaolin Monks</em>, had a rather small-chested Mileena wearing the outfit that appears to be combining her old costumes from <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat Gold</em>. An early concept art of Mileena for the 2011 game was also published by the character designer Vincent Proce in 2011.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a>
</dd>
<dd>6. Players who unlock the Flesh Pit costume receive the <a href="Achievement_(video_gaming)" title="wikilink">achievement / trophy</a> called &quot;Best...Alternate...EVER!&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Mileena (or possibly some earlier clone) was also shown as having Tarkatan blades on her arms in Mileena's promotional trailer for the same game.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a>
</dd>
<dd>7. Mileena's Kombat Karting special weapon is a brief speed boost that is very useful to save her from a Fatality in a death trap or at the finish line, and makes her a &quot;great character&quot; to use in the arena Speedster.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> When playing offline, it also allows the player to &quot;steal first place right at the finish line before the AI gets its own miraculous speed boost&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a>
</dd>
<dd>8. Zamiar, who has portrayed Mileena in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>, plays a black-and-purple outfit clad, sai-wielding, masked, silent character identified only as &quot;Female Ninja&quot; in the film's credits. Her character is appearing briefly in a few scenes, appearing to attack <a href="Ho-Sung_Pak" title="wikilink">Ho-Sung Pak</a>'s (Liu Kang in the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>) character Lang and then mysteriously disappear.
</dd>
<dd>9. In which Mileena-inspired character Keiko is shown defeating and killing <a href="Raiden_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Raiden</a>-like Ronan in what then turns out to be a match in an <a href="arcade_game" title="wikilink">arcade game</a> called &quot;Mortal Conflict&quot; (a pun on <em>Mortal Kombat</em>), as played and commented on by Roxy (Freefall) and Grunge, two of the comic's main characters. The issue was written by <a href="Brandon_Choi" title="wikilink">Brandon Choi</a> and drawn by <a href="J._Scott_Campbell" title="wikilink">J. Scott Campbell</a>.
</dd>
<dd>10. In a short spoof scene parody-referencing the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, the show's character Janet is depicted to be dressed as Mileena and killed Fatality-style by the main character <a href="Cleveland_Brown" title="wikilink">Cleveland Brown</a> dressed as Scorpion. The scene appears at around the 7 minute mark.
</dd>
<dd>11. Chibi was quoted as saying: &quot;I like the character because she's pretty insane and vicious and seems like she'd be very attractive, but then has this mouth full of heinous sharp teeth.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a>
</dd>
<dd>12. In Preisler's novel, Mileenaa appears in a scene similar to this in the film, but set in a mist-covered jungle wilderness. She attacks Sonya just as <a href="Smoke_(Mortal_Kombat)" title="wikilink">Smoke</a> attacks Jax, but looks completely different, with unmasked human face and yellow-red-black eyes,<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> laughing an insane and inhuman laughter. In the novel, it is Mileena who scissor-grips Sonya&lt;U+2019&gt;s neck with &quot;her powerful thigh muscles&quot; (the move used on her by Sonya in the film) and she actually introduces herself, adding that she does not appreciate being confused with her &quot;virtuous half-sister.&quot; Sonya defeats her by grabbing one of Mileena's own sai and bringing its short-staff down across her windpipe to strangle her to death. Later, when they examine Mileena's corpse, Sonya wonders if Mileena was just &quot;another cyborg&quot; due to the griffon-like tattoo on her shoulder matching the mark that has been on <a href="Cyrax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyrax</a>.
