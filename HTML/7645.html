<p>The <strong>1907 Tiflis bank robbery</strong>, also known as the <strong>Yerevan Square expropriation</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was an armed robbery on 26 June 1907 in the <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgian</a> city of Tiflis (now Georgia's capital, <a href="Tbilisi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tbilisi</a>). A bank cash shipment was stolen by <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a> to fund their revolutionary activities. The robbers attacked a bank stagecoach and surrounding security forces using bombs and guns while the stagecoach was transporting money through <a href="Freedom_Square,_Tbilisi" title="wikilink">Yerevan Square</a> (now Freedom Square) between the post office and the Tiflis branch of the <a href="State_Bank_of_the_Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">State Bank of the Russian Empire</a>. The attack killed forty people and injured fifty others, according to official archive documents. The robbers escaped with 341,000 <a href="Russian_ruble" title="wikilink">rubles</a> (equivalent to around US $3.4 million in 2008).</p>
<p>The robbery was organized by a number of high-level <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a>, including <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Lenin</a>, <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>, <a href="Maxim_Litvinov" title="wikilink">Maxim Litvinov</a>, <a href="Leonid_Krasin" title="wikilink">Leonid Krasin</a>, and <a href="Alexander_Bogdanov" title="wikilink">Alexander Bogdanov</a>, and executed by a gang of Georgian revolutionaries led by Stalin's early associate <a href="Kamo_(Bolshevik)" title="wikilink">Kamo</a>. Because such activities were explicitly prohibited by the <a href="5th_Congress_of_the_Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">5th Congress</a> of the <a href="RSDLP" title="wikilink">Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP)</a>, the robbery and the killings caused outrage within the party against the Bolsheviks (a faction within the RSDLP). As a result, Lenin and Stalin tried to distance themselves from the robbery. The events surrounding the incident and similar robberies split the Bolshevik leadership, with Lenin against Bogdanov and Krasin. Despite the success of the robbery and the large sum involved, the Bolsheviks were unable to use most of the large bank notes obtained from the robbery because their serial numbers were known to the police. Lenin conceived of a plan to have various individuals cash the large bank notes at once at various locations thoroughout <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> in January 1908, but this strategy failed, resulting in a number of arrests, worldwide publicity, and negative reaction from European <a href="social_democrats" title="wikilink">social democrats</a>.</p>
<p>Kamo was caught shortly after the robbery in <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Germany</a> but successfully avoided a criminal trial by feigning insanity for over three years. He managed to escape from his psychiatric ward but was captured two years later while planning another robbery. Kamo was then sentenced to death for his crimes including the 1907 robbery, but this sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. He was released after the <a href="1917_Revolution" title="wikilink">1917 Revolution</a>. None of the other major participants or organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The <a href="Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a> (RSDLP), the predecessor to the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, was formed in 1898. The goal of the RSDLP was to change the economic and political system in the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> through a <a href="proletarian_revolution" title="wikilink">proletarian revolution</a> in accordance with <a href="Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxist doctrine</a>. Alongside their political activities, the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups (such as <a href="anarchists" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchists</a> and <a href="Socialist_Revolutionaries" title="wikilink">Socialist Revolutionaries</a>) practised a range of militant operations, including &quot;expropriations&quot;, a euphemism for armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1903 onwards, the RSDLP was divided between two major groups: the <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a> and the <a href="Menshevik" title="wikilink">Mensheviks</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After the suppression of the <a href="1905_Revolution" title="wikilink">1905 Revolution</a> by the Russian Empire, the RSDLP held its <a href="5th_Congress_of_the_Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">5th Congress</a> in May&lt;U+2013&gt;June 1907 in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> with the hopes of resolving differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> One issue that still separated the two groups was the divergence of their views on militant activities, and in particular, &quot;expropriations&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The most militant Bolsheviks, led at the 5th Congress by <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Lenin</a>, supported continuation of the use of robberies, while Mensheviks advocated a more peaceful and gradual approach to revolution, and opposed militant operations. At the 5th Congress, a resolution passed condemning participation in or assistance to all militant activity, including &quot;expropriations&quot; as &quot;disorganizing and demoralizing&quot;, and called for all party militias to be disbanded.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This resolution passed with 65 per cent supporting and 6 per cent opposing (others abstained or did not vote) with all Mensheviks and even some Bolsheviks supporting the resolution.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the unified party's prohibition on separate committees, during the 5th Congress the Bolsheviks elected their own governing body, called the <a href="Bolshevik_Centre" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Centre</a>, and kept it secret from the rest of the RSDLP.<ref name="Young Stalin p=3<U+2013>4&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The Bolshevik Centre was headed by a &quot;Finance Group&quot; consisting of Lenin, <a href="Leonid_Krasin" title="wikilink">Leonid Krasin</a> and <a href="Alexander_Bogdanov" title="wikilink">Alexander Bogdanov</a>. Among other party activities, the Bolshevik leadership had already planned a number of &quot;expropriations&quot; in different parts of Russia by the time of the 5th Congress and was awaiting a major robbery in Tiflis, which occurred only weeks after the 5th Congress ended.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Before the 5th Congress met, high-ranking Bolsheviks held a meeting in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> in April 1907 to discuss staging a robbery to obtain funds to purchase arms. Attendees included Lenin, Krasin, Bogdanov, <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>, and <a href="Maxim_Litvinov" title="wikilink">Maxim Litvinov</a>. The group decided that Stalin, then known by his earlier <em><a href="nom_de_guerre" title="wikilink">nom de guerre</a></em> Koba, and fellow Georgian <a href="Kamo_(Bolshevik)" title="wikilink">Simon Ter-Petrossian</a>, known as Kamo, should organize a bank robbery in the city of <a href="Tiflis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiflis</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The 29-year-old Stalin was living in Tiflis with his wife <a href="Ekaterina_Svanidze" title="wikilink">Ekaterina</a> and newborn son <a href="Yakov_Stalin" title="wikilink">Yakov</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Stalin was experienced at organizing robberies, and these exploits had helped him gain a reputation as the Centre's principal financier.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><ref name="Young Stalin p=3<U+2013>4&quot; /&gt; Kamo, four years younger than Stalin, had a reputation for ruthlessness; later in his life he cut a man's heart from his chest.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At the time of the conspiracy, Kamo ran a criminal organization called &quot;the Outfit&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Stalin said that Kamo was &quot;a master of disguise&quot;,<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt; and Lenin called Kamo his &quot;Caucasian bandit&quot;.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt; Stalin and Kamo had grown up together, and Stalin had converted Kamo to <a href="Marxism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marxism</a>.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>After the April meeting, Stalin and Litvinov traveled to Tiflis to inform Kamo of the plans and to organize the raid.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> According to Roman Brackman's <em>The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life</em>, while Stalin was working with the Bolsheviks to organize criminal activities, he was also acting as an informant for the <a href="Okhrana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okhrana</a>, the Russian secret police. Brackman alleges that once the group returned to Tiflis, Stalin informed his Okhrana contact, Officer Mukhtarov, about the bank robbery plans and promised to provide the Okhrana with more information at a later time.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In Tiflis, Stalin began planning for the robbery.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was able to establish contact with two individuals with inside information about the <a href="State_Bank_of_the_Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">State Bank's</a> operations: a bank clerk named Gigo Kasradze and an old school friend of Stalin's named Voznesensky who worked at the Tiflis banking mail office.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Voznesensky later stated that he had helped out in the theft out of admiration for Stalin's romantic poetry.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><ref name="Portrait p=77<U+2013>78&quot; /&gt; Voznesensky worked in the Tiflis banking mail office, giving him access to a secret schedule that showed the times that cash would be transferred by stagecoach to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Voznesensky notified Stalin that the bank would be receiving a large shipment of money by horse-drawn carriage on 26 June 1907.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><ref name="Portrait p=77<U+2013>78&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Krasin helped manufacture bombs to use in the attack on the stagecoach.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Only weeks before the robbery, Kamo accidentally set off one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered by the time of the robbery.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="day-of-the-robbery">Day of the robbery</h2>
<p>On the day of the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, including Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 minutes from the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted each security officer prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The gang members mostly dressed themselves as peasants and waited on street corners with revolvers and grenades.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt; In contrast to the others, Kamo was disguised as a cavalry captain and came to the square in a horse-drawn <a href="Phaeton_(carriage)" title="wikilink">phaeton</a>, a type of open carriage.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The conspirators took over the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in preparation for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in Yerevan Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later turned out to be one of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn.<ref name="Young Stalin p=6<U+2013>7&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The Tiflis branch of the <a href="State_Bank_of_the_Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">State Bank of the Russian Empire</a> had arranged to transport funds between the <a href="post_office" title="wikilink">post office</a> and the State Bank by horse-drawn <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Inside the stagecoach was the money, two guards with rifles, a bank cashier, and a bank accountant.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> A phaeton filled with guards rode behind the stagecoach, and horse-mounted guards rode in front, next to, and behind the carriages.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the carriage with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Bombs were thrown from all directions.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The Georgian newspaper <em>Isari</em> reported: &quot;No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs ...

<p>According to Brackman, several days after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov questioned Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin in the face and had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Muktarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to <a href="Baku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baku</a> to await a decision in the case.

<p><a href="Nadezhda_Krupskaya" title="wikilink">Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>, Lenin's wife, discussed these events in her memoirs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money obtained in the Tiflis raid was handed over to the Bolsheviks for revolutionary purposes. But the money could not be used. It was all in 500-ruble notes, which had to be changed. This could not be done in Russia, as the banks always had lists of the note numbers in such cases ...The money was badly needed. And so a group of comrades made an attempt to change the 500-ruble notes simultaneously in various towns abroad, just a few days after our arrival ... Zhitomirsky had warned the police about the attempt to change the ruble notes, and those involved in it were arrested. A member of the Zurich group, a Lett, was arrested in Stockholm, and Olga Ravich, a member of the Geneva group, who had recently returned from Russia, was arrested in Munich with Bogdassarian and Khojamirian. In Geneva N. A. Semashko was arrested after a postcard addressed to one of the arrested men was delivered to his house.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brackman claims that despite the arrests, Lenin continued his attempts to exchange the 500-ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p>After Kamo was arrested in Berlin and awaiting trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity so that he would be declared unfit to stand trial.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and ate his own excrement.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> To make sure that he was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a long needle, and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act.<ref name="Bolshevism pp=101<U+2013>102&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that &quot;there is no foundation to the belief that [Kamo] is feigning insanity.

<p>Kamo later discussed these experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What can I tell you? They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like. One of the men forced me to look into the mirror. There I saw &lt;U+2212&gt; not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. I thought to myself, 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. You know I think they liked that ... I thought a great deal: 'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. I did not have faith in myself, see? ... [The authorities], of course, know their business, their science. But they do not know the <a href="Peoples_of_the_Caucasus" title="wikilink">Caucasians</a>. Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. Well, who will drive whom mad?
