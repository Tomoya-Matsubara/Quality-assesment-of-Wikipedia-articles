<p><strong>Interstate 805</strong> (<strong>I-805</strong>) is a major north&lt;U+2013&gt;south <a href="Interstate_Highway_System" title="wikilink">Interstate Highway</a> in <a href="Southern_California" title="wikilink">Southern California</a>. It is a <a href="bypass_(road)" title="wikilink">bypass</a> of <a href="Interstate_5_in_California" title="wikilink">I-5</a>, running along the eastern areas of the <a href="San_Diego&lt;U+2013&gt;Tijuana_metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">Greater San Diego area</a> from <a href="San_Ysidro,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">San Ysidro</a> near the <a href="Mexico_&lt;U+2013&gt;_United_States_border" title="wikilink">Mexico&lt;U+2013&gt;U.S. border</a> to near <a href="Del_Mar,_California" title="wikilink">Del Mar</a>. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses through the cities of <a href="Chula_Vista,_California" title="wikilink">Chula Vista</a> and <a href="National_City,_California" title="wikilink">National City</a> before reentering San Diego. The freeway then passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of <a href="North_Park,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">North Park</a>, <a href="Mission_Valley,_California" title="wikilink">Mission Valley</a>, <a href="Clairemont,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">Clairemont</a>, and <a href="University_City,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">University City</a> before terminating at I-5 in the <a href="Sorrento_Valley,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">Sorrento Valley</a> neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.</p>
<p>Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in the <a href="1964_state_highway_renumbering_(California)" title="wikilink">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the <strong>Jacob Dekema Freeway</strong> after the longtime head of the regional division of the <a href="California_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the <strong>Mission Valley Viaduct</strong>. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the northern interchange with I-5. <a href="High-occupancy_toll" title="wikilink">High-occupancy toll</a> lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.</p>

<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>According to Dekema, planning for I-805 began in 1956.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as <strong>Route 241</strong>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101, when it was completed in several years.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the <a href="1964_state_highway_renumbering_(California)" title="wikilink">1964 state highway renumbering</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route done by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to allow people to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, homes along the route were being sold in the <a href="North_Park,_San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">North Park</a> area, which was to be the first stretch of the freeway constructed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the <strong>Inland Freeway</strong> to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1967, bidding began after construction had been delayed by that of I-5 and I-8 which had been given higher priority. This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue (a distance of ), and the next portion would include the I-8 interchange.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The R.E.

<p>Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> in the meantime, National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants, as well as a shopping center.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Bidding was to begin on  of I-805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then <a href="US_395_(CA)" title="wikilink">US 395</a> in mid-1969.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September, when there were concerns that an order from President <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road. However, Governor <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> A month later, the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $15 million (about $ ); the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases, while construction continued south of I-8 to Wabash Boulevard.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The  portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G.

<p>By March 1970, the original section between Home Avenue and near I-8 was almost complete, and the Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395 as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista were still under construction.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to E.C.

On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was completed.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the <a href="Playas_de_Tijuana" title="wikilink">Playas de Tijuana</a> area, that would be accessible from I-805, although another alternative was considered near <a href="Brown_Field" title="wikilink">Brown Field</a>;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> a formal study was commissioned in August.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> However, it was discovered that this would add $10 million (about $ ) to the cost of the freeway, and possibly delay it by up to 10 years; furthermore, most traffic crossing the border was found to head to <a href="Tijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tijuana</a> and not <a href="Ensenada,_Baja_California" title="wikilink">Ensenada</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Following this, the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway, even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 1970, bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94, and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> By the end of the year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bit of $7.2 million (about $ ) for the northernmost portion.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimate for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Estimates on the Mission Valley bridge had slipped to July 1972 by March.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> A 102-home <a href="mobile_home_park" title="wikilink">mobile home park</a> was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I-805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> However, I-805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981, and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Because of his efforts in designing I-805, Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the <a href="American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> (ASCE); he designed several other regional freeways, including <a href="SR_163_(CA)" title="wikilink">SR 163</a> through <a href="Balboa_Park_(San_Diego)" title="wikilink">Balboa Park</a> and I-5 through San Diego.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="expansion">Expansion</h3>
<p>The construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the northern end was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two <a href="carriageways" class="uri" title="wikilink">carriageways</a> needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or <a href="I-805_(CA)" title="wikilink">I-805</a>. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> SANDAG funded the construction with $110 million (about $ ) in mid-2000.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Construction of the &quot;dual freeway&quot; began in early 2002, at a cost of $182 million<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> (about $ ) The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> That year, a three-year project began to allow <a href="Driverless_car" title="wikilink">robot controlled vehicles</a>, including buses and trucks, to use a special lane. The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes. The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Two years later, construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding <a href="high-occupancy_toll" title="wikilink">high-occupancy toll</a> express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The CTC awarded $100 million for the work in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Work is also underway to add two <a href="High-occupancy_vehicle" title="wikilink">HOV lanes</a> between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5 million from the CTC in September 2011.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the <a href="SR_125_(CA)" title="wikilink">SR 125</a> toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2013, construction began on the northern express lanes; the project is expected to cost $86 million.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> By May, construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun, and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The southern express lanes project is projected to cost $1.4 billion.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
