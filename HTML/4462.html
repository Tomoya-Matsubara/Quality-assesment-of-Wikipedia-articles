FRS was responsible for scientific and technical research into the marine and freshwater <a href="Scottish_fisheries" title="wikilink">fisheries</a> and <a href="aquaculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">aquaculture</a>, and the protection of the aquatic <a href="Ecosystem" title="wikilink">environment</a> in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. For these purposes, the agency had two fishery <a href="laboratories" class="uri" title="wikilink">laboratories</a>, allowing specialisation in both marine and freshwater fisheries. The FRS also maintained two research vessels.</p>
