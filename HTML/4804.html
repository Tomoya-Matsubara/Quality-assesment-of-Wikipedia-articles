<h2 id="history-of-the-airport">History of the Airport</h2>
<p>Garbutt Airport (now known as Townsville International Airport) was opened in 1939, after relocating from an old airfield which was located in the southern Townsville suburb of <a href="Annandale,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Annandale</a>, This airfield was subject to frequent flooding due to climatic conditions in the region (i.e cyclones, thunderstorms, and wind to name a few) and being built on and near wetlands. So Garbutt Airport was built, ironically also on wetlands but not subject to as much flooding as the old airport (which is now a sports reserve and housing estate). In 1939, the year <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> was declared, the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> also decided to set up a base at Garbutt Airport, and the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">USAAF</a> also used the Airport as a major base for battles in the South Sea, thus making Garbutt Airport one of the largest airports in the Southern Hemisphere during the war.</p>
<p>Townsville Airport saw an increasing number of passengers and Aircraft movements since WWII, with many flights operated by Qantas, TAA, ANA and Ansett, with flights to <a href="Brisbane,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a>, though it wasn't until the mid 1960s when the Airport really took off. Trans Australia Airways and Ansett - ANA, were receiving numerous jet Aircraft, namely <a href="Boeing_727" title="wikilink">Boeing 727</a>'s and <a href="DC-9" title="wikilink">DC-9s</a>, and Townsville was a mini hub for both Airlines during the 1970s. In April 1980, Sir <a href="Rupert_Murdoch" title="wikilink">Rupert Murdoch</a> and Sir <a href="Peter_Abeles" title="wikilink">Peter Abeles</a>, the new owners of Ansett were requesting for international flights to begin in some regional centres of Australia and on <a href="18_April" title="wikilink">18 April</a> <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>, the inaugural Townsville-Singapore flight began, operated by <a href="Ansett_Australia" title="wikilink">Ansett</a>, one of the first international flights Ansett had ever operated. In the same year, Townsville Airport was given $13m by the government-owned operator, <a href="Federal_Airports_Limited" title="wikilink">Federal Airports Limited</a>, to construct and build a new state-of-the-art international terminal, and in 1981, it was opened with the arrival of a <a href="Qantas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qantas</a> <a href="Boeing_747" title="wikilink">Boeing 747</a>. Destinations included were Singapore, <a href="Auckland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auckland</a>, <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> and even <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a>, <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, and <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, This was of course at a time where there was a huge tourism demand between the <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">USA</a> and <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> as today this is an unrealistic service for many regional east coast airports, making Townsville the first regional Australian airport to offer direct long-distance international flights. Airlines included, Qantas, Ansett, <a href="Continental_Micronesia" title="wikilink">Continental Micronesia</a>, <a href="Garuda_Indonesia" title="wikilink">Garuda Indonesia</a>, <a href="Air_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Air New Zealand</a>, <a href="Cathay_Pacific" title="wikilink">Cathay Pacific</a> and <a href="Japan_Airlines" title="wikilink">JAL</a> at one stage.</p>
<p>The airport received another expansion in <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> when a new domestic expansion of the international terminal opened. In <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a>, the Australian aviation industry was in a crisis with the <a href="1989_Australian_pilots&#39;_strike" title="wikilink">pilots dispute</a> ceasing nearly all domestic flights in the country. Some international flights continued but in <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a> most domestic services returned but a new crisis was beginning for Townsville International Airport.</p>
<p>With the increasing amount of passengers on each international flight into the country, but less flights, there was increasing rivalry between <a href="Townsville,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Townsville</a> and <a href="Cairns,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Cairns</a> over international flights. In 1991, <a href="Cairns_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Cairns International Airport</a> also receiving a boom in international flights since the 1980s, hit hard with a major proposal of a separate international terminal which was able to accommodate a lot more passengers at a single time than Townsville's terminal and Cairns's original terminal, and airlines found that as an opportunity to only have the one hub in Northern Queensland instead of 2 hubs, and thus there was an increasing demand for tourism in <a href="Cairns,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Cairns</a> than Townsville. So in 1993 when Cairns' new terminal opened, all the airlines, except Qantas, Ansett, Cathay Pacific and Garuda, stopped international flights to Townsville, but eventually in 1995, the remaining Airlines ceased international flights to Townsville. <a href="image:intlTSV.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|200px|Townsville's International Aerobridge and gate. It was opened in 1981, and lately hasn't been used much at all</a></p>
<p>In the mid 1990s domestic flights started to decrease as well, with some services being cut back by Qantas and Ansett, and the aircraft in use on the route to Sydney was progressively being phased out that year by Qantas. Services also received a giant drop when <a href="Ansett_Australia" title="wikilink">Ansett</a> was into voluntary Liquidation in late <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>. Around 40% of Townsville's flights and capacity to Brisbane were cut because of Ansett's troubles. But that same year was also the start of a new era in domestic travel for Townsville International Airport: in February <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, <a href="Virgin_Blue" title="wikilink">Virgin Blue</a> made Townsville its first regional destination, and passenger figures rose by 25% that year. Then in June, <a href="Qantas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qantas</a> announced that the airline would resume international services to Singapore in September. In August, Qantas announced that it would resume Townsville-Sydney services using <a href="Boeing_717" title="wikilink">Boeing 717</a> aircraft acquired when Qantas bought out <a href="Impulse_Airlines" title="wikilink">Impulse Airlines</a>. When Ansett collapsed, Qantas and Virgin helped fill the gap that Ansett left.</p>
<p>In August <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, Qantas cut the services to Singapore, due to lack of demand, It was also the first time since 1994 that a <a href="Boeing_747" title="wikilink">Boeing 747</a> was used on regular service to Townsville. Virgin and Qantas and a new airline, <a href="Alliance_Airlines" title="wikilink">Alliance Airlines</a> were increasing flights to Townsville bringing more passengers to the city and increasing domestic tourism to Townsville. Also that year, <a href="Australian_Airports_Ltd" title="wikilink">Australian Airports Ltd</a> announced that Townsville domestic terminal would receive a State-of-the-art upgrade and the new redevelopment would open in October 2003.</p>
<p><strong>See Redevelopment in Terminal and Facilities Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The redevelopment eventually opened in December 2003, around 2 months later than planned, as it was originally planned to be opened in October 2003 before the 3 <a href="2003_Rugby_Union_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Rugby Union World Cup</a> matches Townsville hosted. The first arrival was Qantas 737 from Brisbane which usually arrives 10pm and overnights and departs around 6am the next moring, thus making it also the first departure from the new concourse.</p>
