<p><strong>World War I</strong> (<strong>WWI</strong>), also called the <strong>First World War</strong> or <strong>Great War</strong>, was a <a href="World_war" title="wikilink">major war</a> centered in Europe that began in the summer of 1914 and lasted until November 1918. It involved all of the world's <a href="great_powers" title="wikilink">great powers</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which were assembled in two opposing alliances: the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Allies</a> (centred around the <a href="Triple_Entente" title="wikilink">Triple Entente</a>) and the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a> (originally centered around the <a href="Triple_Alliance_(1882)" title="wikilink">Triple Alliance</a>).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> More than 9 million combatants <a href="World_War_I_casualties" title="wikilink">were killed</a>, largely because of great technological advances in firepower without corresponding advances in mobility.

<p>The <a href="Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" title="wikilink">assassination on 28 June 1914</a> of <a href="Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a>, the heir to the throne of <a href="Austria-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a>, was the proximate trigger of the war. Long-term causes, such as <a href="imperialism" title="wikilink">imperialistic</a> foreign policies of the great powers of Europe, such as the <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">German Empire</a>, the <a href="Austria-Hungary#The_Great_War" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, the <a href="Ottoman_Empire#Dissolution_(1908&lt;U+2013&gt;1922)" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>, the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>, the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, and <a href="Italy_in_World_War_I#From_neutrality_to_the_intervention_in_the_war" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, played a major role. Ferdinand's assassination by a <a href="Yugoslav_nationalism" title="wikilink">Yugoslav nationalist</a> resulted in a <a href="July_Ultimatum" title="wikilink">Habsburg ultimatum</a> against the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Several alliances formed over the past decades were invoked, so within weeks the major powers were at war; via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.</p>
<p>On 28 July, the conflict opened with the Austro-Hungarian <a href="Serbian_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">invasion of Serbia</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> followed by the German invasion of <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a> and France; and a Russian attack against Germany. After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt, the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> settled into a static battle of attrition with a <a href="trench_warfare" title="wikilink">trench line</a> that changed little until 1917. In the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">East</a>, the Russian army successfully fought against the Austro-Hungarian forces but was forced back by the German army. Additional fronts opened after the Ottoman Empire joined the war in 1914, Italy and <a href="Kingdom_of_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> in 1915 and <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> in 1916. The Russian Empire <a href="Russian_Revolution_(1917)" title="wikilink">collapsed</a> in 1917, and Russia left the war after the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a> later that year. After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, United States forces entered the trenches and the Allies drove back the German armies in a series of successful offensives. Germany agreed to a cease-fire on 11 November 1918, later known as <a href="Armistice_Day" title="wikilink">Armistice Day</a>.</p>
<p>By the war's end, four major imperial powers&lt;U+2014&gt;the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires&lt;U+2014&gt;had been militarily and politically defeated and had ceased to exist. The former two states lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely. The map of central Europe was completely redrawn into several smaller states.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, and the repercussions of Germany's defeat and the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> led to the beginning of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> in 1939.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>Before World War II, the war was also known as <em>The Great War</em>, <em>The World War</em>, or <em>The War in Europe</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In France and Belgium, it was sometimes referred to as <em>La Guerre du Droit</em> (<em>the War for Justice</em>) or <em>La Guerre Pour la Civilisation</em> / <em>de Oorlog tot de Beschaving</em> (<em>the War to Preserve Civilisation</em>), especially on medals and commemorative monuments. The term used by official histories of the war in Britain and Canada is <em>First World War</em>, while American histories generally use the term <em>World War I</em>.</p>
<p>The earliest known use of the term <em>First World War</em> appeared in September 1914 when German biologist and philosopher <a href="Ernst_Haeckel" title="wikilink">Ernst Haeckel</a> said, &quot;there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'&quot; ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The terms <em>World War I</em> and <em>First World War</em> both became standard (in the United States and Britain respectively) beginning in about 1940 to 1942; prior to that, it was most commonly called <em>The Great War</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor <a href="Otto_von_Bismarck" title="wikilink">Bismarck</a> negotiated the <a href="League_of_the_Three_Emperors" title="wikilink">League of the Three Emperors</a> (German: <em>Dreikaiserbund</em>) between the monarchs of Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the <a href="Dual_Alliance_(1879)" title="wikilink">Dual Alliance</a>. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the <a href="Balkans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkans</a> as the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> continued to weaken.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the <a href="Triple_Alliance_(1882)" title="wikilink">Triple Alliance</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After 1870, European conflict was averted largely through a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe orchestrated by Chancellor Bismarck. He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. With the ascension of <a href="Wilhelm_II_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Wilhelm II</a> as <a href="German_Emperor" title="wikilink">German Emperor</a> (<em>Kaiser</em>), Bismarck's system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the <a href="Reinsurance_Treaty" title="wikilink">Reinsurance Treaty</a> with Russia in 1890. Two years later, the <a href="Franco-Russian_Alliance" title="wikilink">Franco-Russian Alliance</a> was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, the United Kingdom sealed an alliance with France, the <a href="Entente_cordiale" title="wikilink">Entente cordiale</a> and in 1907, the United Kingdom and Russia signed the <a href="Anglo-Russian_Convention" title="wikilink">Anglo-Russian Convention</a>. This system of interlocking bilateral agreements formed the <a href="Triple_Entente" title="wikilink">Triple Entente</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after <a href="German_unification" title="wikilink">unification and the foundation of the empire</a> in 1870. From the mid-1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the <em><a href="Kaiserliche_Marine" title="wikilink">Kaiserliche Marine</a></em> (Imperial German Navy), established by Admiral <a href="Alfred_von_Tirpitz" title="wikilink">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, in rivalry with the British <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> for world naval supremacy.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> As a result, both nations strove to out-build each other in terms of <a href="capital_ships" title="wikilink">capital ships</a>. With the launch of  in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rivals.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to the production of the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50 percent.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Austria-Hungary precipitated the <a href="Bosnian_crisis" title="wikilink">Bosnian crisis</a> of 1908&lt;U+2013&gt;1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, which it had occupied since 1878. This greatly angered the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a> and its patron, the <a href="Pan-Slavism" title="wikilink">Pan-Slavic</a> and <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as &quot;the <a href="Powder_keg_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Powder keg of Europe</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and <a href="Southern_Dobruja" title="wikilink">Southern Dobruja</a> to Romania in the 33-day <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a>, further destabilising the region.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="confusion-among-the-central-powers">Confusion among the Central Powers</h4>
<p>The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but never tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing the majority of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the <a href="Austro-Hungarian_Army" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.</p>
<p>On 9 September 1914, the <a href="Septemberprogramm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Septemberprogramm</a>, a possible plan which detailed Germany's specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force upon the Allied Powers, was outlined by <a href="Chancellor_of_Germany" title="wikilink">German Chancellor</a> <a href="Theobald_von_Bethmann-Hollweg" title="wikilink">Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg</a>.

By 12 September, the French with assistance from the <a href="British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">British forces</a> halted the German advance east of Paris at the <a href="First_Battle_of_the_Marne" title="wikilink">First Battle of the Marne</a> (5&lt;U+2013&gt;12 September).

Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French <em><a href="poilu" class="uri" title="wikilink">poilu</a></em> (infantry) and led to <a href="French_Army_Mutinies_(1917)" title="wikilink">widespread mutinies</a>, especially during the <a href="Nivelle_Offensive" title="wikilink">Nivelle Offensive</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <img src="Canadian_tank_and_soldiers_Vimy_1917.jpg" title="fig:Canadian troops advancing behind a British Mark II tank at the Battle of Vimy Ridge." alt="Canadian troops advancing behind a British Mark II tank at the Battle of Vimy Ridge." /></p>

At the strategic level, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at <a href="Battle_of_Verdun" title="wikilink">Verdun</a>, the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines. At the tactical level, German commander <a href="Erich_Ludendorff" title="wikilink">Erich Ludendorff</a>'s doctrine of &quot;<a href="defense_in_depth" title="wikilink">elastic defence</a>&quot; was well suited for trench warfare. This defence had a relatively lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range, from which an immediate and powerful counter-offensive could be launched.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>Around 1.1 to 1.2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A thousand battalions, occupying sectors of the line from the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> to the <a href="Orne_River_(Lorraine)" title="wikilink">Orne River</a>, operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over  of trenches.

<p><img src="Grand_Fleet_sails.jpg" title="fig:The British Grand Fleet making steam for Scapa Flow, 1914" alt="The British Grand Fleet making steam for Scapa Flow, 1914" /> At the start of the war, the German Empire had <a href="cruiser" title="wikilink">cruisers</a> scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied <a href="merchant_shipping" title="wikilink">merchant shipping</a>. The British <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser <a href="SMS_Emden_(1908)" title="wikilink">SMS <em>Emden</em></a>, part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the bulk of the <a href="German_East_Asia_Squadron" title="wikilink">German East-Asia squadron</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;consisting of the armoured cruisers  and , light cruisers  and  and two transport ships&lt;U+2014&gt;did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it encountered elements of the British fleet. The German flotilla, along with , sank two armoured cruisers at the <a href="Battle_of_Coronel" title="wikilink">Battle of Coronel</a>, but was almost destroyed at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> in December 1914, with only <em>Dresden</em> and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the <a href="Battle_of_M&lt;U+00E1&gt;s_a_Tierra" title="wikilink">Battle of M&lt;U+00E1&gt;s a Tierra</a> these too were destroyed or interned.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Hochseeflotte_2.jpg" title="fig:A battleship squadron of the Hochseeflotte at sea" alt="A battleship squadron of the Hochseeflotte at sea" /> Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval <a href="blockade_of_Germany" title="wikilink">blockade of Germany</a>. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1916 <a href="Battle_of_Jutland" title="wikilink">Battle of Jutland</a> (German: <em>Skagerrakschlacht</em>, or &quot;Battle of the Skagerrak&quot;) developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. It took place on 31 May &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 June 1916, in the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> off <a href="Jutland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jutland</a>. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral <a href="Reinhard_Scheer" title="wikilink">Reinhard Scheer</a>, squared off against the Royal Navy's <a href="Grand_Fleet" title="wikilink">Grand Fleet</a>, led by Admiral Sir <a href="John_Jellicoe,_1st_Earl_Jellicoe" title="wikilink">John Jellicoe</a>. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>German <a href="U-boats" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-boats</a> attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The United States launched a protest, and Germany modified its rules of engagement. After the notorious sinking of the passenger ship <a href="RMS_Lusitania" title="wikilink">RMS <em>Lusitania</em></a> in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the &quot;cruiser rules&quot; which demanded warning and placing crews in &quot;a place of safety&quot; (a standard which lifeboats did not meet).<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of <a href="unrestricted_submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>, realising the Americans would eventually enter the war.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas, but were only able to maintain five long range U-boats on station, to limited effect.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="NationaalArchief_uboat155London.jpg" title="fig:U-155 exhibited near Tower Bridge in London after the First World War." alt="U-155 exhibited near Tower Bridge in London after the First World War." /> The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in <a href="Convoys_in_World_War_I" title="wikilink">convoys escorted by destroyers</a>. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the introduction of <a href="hydrophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrophone</a> and <a href="depth_charge" title="wikilink">depth charges</a>, accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. The convoy system slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters. Troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>World War I also saw the first use of <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a> in combat, with <a href="HMS_Furious_(47)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Furious</em></a> launching <a href="Sopwith_Camels" title="wikilink">Sopwith Camels</a> in a successful raid against the <a href="Zeppelin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeppelin</a> hangars at <a href="Tondern_raid" title="wikilink">Tondern</a> in July 1918, as well as <a href="blimp" title="wikilink">blimps</a> for antisubmarine patrol.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

Serbia lost about 850,000 people, a quarter of its prewar population, and half its prewar resources." /> Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>. A Serbian counter attack in the <a href="battle_of_Kolubara" title="wikilink">battle of Kolubara</a>, however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> to join in attacking Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian provinces of <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> and <a href="Bosnia_(region)" title="wikilink">Bosnia</a> provided troops for Austria-Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy. <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> allied itself with Serbia.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month. The attack began in October, when the Central Powers launched an offensive from the north; four days later the Bulgarians joined the attack from the east. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into <a href="Albania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albania</a>, halting only once to make a stand against the Bulgarians. The Serbs suffered defeat near modern day <a href="Gnjilane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gnjilane</a> in the <a href="Battle_of_Kosovo_(1915)" title="wikilink">Battle of Kosovo</a>. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the <a href="Battle_of_Mojkovac" title="wikilink">Battle of Mojkovac</a> in 6&lt;U+2013&gt;7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro, too. Serbian forces were evacuated by ship to Greece.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at <a href="Salonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salonica</a> in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-German <a href="Constantine_I_of_Greece" title="wikilink">King Constantine I</a> dismissed the pro-Allied government of <a href="Eleftherios_Venizelos" title="wikilink">Eleftherios Venizelos</a>, before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The friction between the king of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the <a href="National_Schism" title="wikilink">National Schism</a>, which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos located in Salonica. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an armed confrontation in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as <a href="Noemvriana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Noemvriana</a>) the king of Greece resigned, and his second son <a href="Alexander_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Alexander</a> took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized and began to participate in military operations against the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a> on the Macedonian front. <img src="Entente_on_the_Balkans.jpg" title="fig:The Entente in Macedonia.

From left to right: soldiers from Indochina, France, Senegal, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Serbia, Greece, and India." /> After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria. Bulgarians commenced Bulgarization of the Serbian population in their occupation zone, banishing <a href="Serbian_Cyrillic" title="wikilink">Serbian Cyrillic</a> and the <a href="Serbian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Serbian Orthodox Church</a>. After forced conscription of the Serbian population into the Bulgarian army in 1917, the <a href="Toplica_(river)#Toplica_rebellion" title="wikilink">Toplica Uprising</a> began. Serbian rebels liberated for a short time the area between the <a href="Kopaonik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kopaonik</a> mountains and the <a href="South_Morava" title="wikilink">South Morava</a> river. The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917.</p>
<p>The Macedonian Front proved static for the most part. Serbian forces retook part of Macedonia by recapturing <a href="Bitola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bitola</a> on 19 November 1916. Only at the end of the conflict were the Entente powers able to break through, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the <a href="Battle_of_Dobro_Pole" title="wikilink">Battle of Dobro Pole</a> but days later, they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the <a href="Battle_of_Doiran" title="wikilink">Battle of Doiran</a>, avoiding occupation.

<p><img src="Austro-Hungarian_mountain_corps.jpg" title="fig:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol" alt="Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol" /> Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the <a href="Triple_Alliance_(1882)" title="wikilink">Triple Alliance</a>. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in <a href="Trentino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trentino</a>, <a href="Istria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Istria</a> and <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a>. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of <a href="Tunisia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a> in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the <a href="Trentino-Alto_Adige/S&lt;U+00FC&gt;dtirol" title="wikilink">Southern Tyrol</a>, <a href="Julian_March" title="wikilink">Julian March</a> and territory on the <a href="Dalmatia" title="wikilink">Dalmatian</a> coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the <a href="Treaty_of_London_(1915)" title="wikilink">Treaty of London</a>. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.</p>
<p>Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. <a href="Field_Marshal" title="wikilink">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Luigi_Cadorna" title="wikilink">Luigi Cadorna</a>, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking <a href="Ljubljana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ljubljana</a> and threatening <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>. It was a <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic</a> plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian <a href="Kaisersch&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaisersch&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzen</a> and <a href=":de:Standsch&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzen" title="wikilink">Standsch&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzen</a> engaged Italian <a href="Alpini" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alpini</a> in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counter attacked in the <a href="Asiago" title="wikilink">Altopiano of Asiago</a>, towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, (<em><a href="Battle_of_Asiago" title="wikilink">Strafexpedition</a></em>), but made little progress.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the <a href="So&lt;U+010D&gt;a" title="wikilink">Isonzo front</a> along the <a href="So&lt;U+010D&gt;a" title="wikilink">Isonzo River</a>, north east of <a href="Trieste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trieste</a>. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of <a href="Gorizia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gorizia</a>. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austro-Hungarian troops received large numbers of reinforcements, including German <a href="Stormtrooper" title="wikilink">Stormtroopers</a> and the elite <a href="Alpenkorps_(German_Empire)" title="wikilink">Alpenkorps</a>. The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at <a href="Battle_of_Caporetto" title="wikilink">Caporetto</a>. The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100 kilometres (60 mi.) to reorganise, stabilising the front at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Piave_River" title="wikilink">Piave River</a>. Since in the Battle of Caporetto the Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called <em>'99 Boys</em> (Ragazzi del '99), that is, all males who were 18 years old. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the <a href="Battle_of_the_Piave_River" title="wikilink">Piave River</a> and, finally being decisively defeated in the <a href="Battle_of_Vittorio_Veneto" title="wikilink">Battle of Vittorio Veneto</a> in October of that year. Austria-Hungary surrendered in early November 1918.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Marshal_Joffre_inspecting_Romanian_troops_during_WWI.jpg" title="fig:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops" alt="Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops" /> <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary (<a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> and <a href="Banat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banat</a>), that had a large Romanian population, in exchange for Romania&lt;U+2019&gt;s declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality, and on 27 August 1916 the Romanian Army <a href="Battle_of_Transylvania" title="wikilink">launched an attack</a> against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, pushing back the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counter attack by the forces of the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a> drove back the Russo-Romanian forces and as a result of the <a href="Battle_of_Bucharest" title="wikilink">Battle of Bucharest</a> the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova <a href="Romanian_Campaign#Stabilization_and_stalemate_(1917)" title="wikilink">continued in 1917</a>, resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> As Russia withdrew from the war in late 1917 as a result of the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a>, Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.</p>
<p>In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a> as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the <a href="Bolshevik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolshevik</a> Russian government following talks between 5&lt;U+2013&gt;9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory, formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of the territory on the unification with Romania.</p>
<p>Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the <a href="Treaty_of_Bucharest_(1918)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Bucharest</a> on 7 May 1918. Under that treaty Romania was obliged to cease war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions for Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the <a href="Carpathian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Carpathian Mountains</a> and grant oil concessions for Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a>. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the <a href="Alexandru_Marghiloman" title="wikilink">Alexandru Marghiloman</a> government and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of <a href="Compi&lt;U+00E8&gt;gne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Compi&lt;U+00E8&gt;gne</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-india">The role of India</h4>

<p>The war began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The <a href="British_Indian_Army" title="wikilink">Indian Army</a> in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war. India under British rule contributed greatly to the British war effort by providing men and resources. This was done by the Indian Congress in hope of achieving self-government as India was very much under the control of the British. The United Kingdom disappointed the Indians by not providing self-governance, leading to the <a href="Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi" title="wikilink">Gandhian</a> Era in Indian history. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all 140,000 men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> <img src="Russian_Troops_NGM-v31-p379.jpg" title="fig:Russian troops awaiting a German attack" alt="Russian troops awaiting a German attack" /></p>

<p>While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe. Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian <a href="Kingdom_of_Galicia_and_Lodomeria" title="wikilink">Galicia</a> and German East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, they were driven back from East Prussia by <a href="Paul_von_Hindenburg" title="wikilink">Hindenburg</a> and <a href="Erich_Ludendorff" title="wikilink">Ludendorff</a> at <a href="Battle_of_Tannenberg_(1914)" title="wikilink">Tannenberg</a> and the <a href="First_Battle_of_the_Masurian_Lakes" title="wikilink">Masurian Lakes</a> in August and September 1914.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded.

The success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily with <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>'s entry into the war on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> and <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a> fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsar</a> remained at the front. <a href="Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" title="wikilink">Empress Alexandra's</a> increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, <a href="Grigori_Rasputin" title="wikilink">Rasputin</a>, at the end of 1916.</p>
<p>In March 1917, demonstrations in <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Petrograd</a> culminated in the abdication of <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsar Nicholas II</a> and the appointment of a weak <a href="Russian_Provisional_Government" title="wikilink">Provisional Government</a> which shared power with the <a href="Petrograd_Soviet" title="wikilink">Petrograd Soviet</a> socialists.

<p>In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the <a href="Battle_of_Verdun" title="wikilink">Battle of Verdun</a> and a <a href="Romanian_Campaign_(World_War_I)#The_counteroffensive_of_the_Central_Powers_(September&lt;U+2013&gt;December_1916)" title="wikilink">successful offensive against Romania</a>, the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies. Soon after, U.S. President Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer as a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the U.S. was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the &quot;submarine outrages&quot;. While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of &quot;a direct exchange of views&quot;. Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a &quot;free and united Poland&quot;. On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer, because Germany did not state any specific proposals.

<h4 id="developments-in-1917">Developments in 1917</h4>
<p>Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.</p>
<p>The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the <a href="German_General_Staff" title="wikilink">German General Staff</a> convinced <a href="Chancellor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chancellor</a> <a href="Theobald_von_Bethmann-Hollweg" title="wikilink">Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg</a> to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. While it was realised that the policy was also likely to bring the United States into the conflict, British shipping losses would be so high that it would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. In reality, tonnage sunk rose above 500,000 tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000 tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced <a href="convoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">convoy</a> system became extremely effective in reducing the <a href="U-boat" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-boat</a> threat. Britain was safe from starvation while German industrial output fell, and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated.</p>
<p>On 3 May 1917, during the <a href="Nivelle_Offensive" title="wikilink">Nivelle Offensive</a>, the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused their orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. Then, <a href="French_Army_Mutinies_(1917)" title="wikilink">mutinies</a> afflicted an additional 54 French divisions and saw 20,000 men desert. The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> <a href="Robert_Nivelle" title="wikilink">Robert Nivelle</a> was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General <a href="Philippe_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tain" title="wikilink">Philippe P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tain</a>, who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.</p>

<p>The victory of Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary and Germany at the <a href="Battle_of_Caporetto" title="wikilink">Battle of Caporetto</a> led the Allies at the <a href="Rapallo_Conference" title="wikilink">Rapallo Conference</a> to form the <a href="Supreme_War_Council" title="wikilink">Supreme War Council</a> to coordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.</p>
<p>In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. This released large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<h5 id="non-intervention">Non-Intervention</h5>
<p>The United States originally pursued a policy of <a href="non-intervention" class="uri" title="wikilink">non-intervention</a>, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When a German U-boat sank the British liner <a href="RMS_Lusitania" title="wikilink"><em>Lusitania</em></a> in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> vowed, &quot;America is too proud to fight&quot; and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law and U.S. ideas of human rights. Wilson was under pressure from former president <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who denounced German acts as &quot;piracy&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Wilson's desire to have a seat at negotiations at war's end to advance the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> also played a role.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Wilson's Secretary of State, <a href="William_Jennings_Bryan" title="wikilink">William Jennings Bryan</a>, whose opinions had been ignored, resigned as he could no longer support the president's policy. Public opinion was angered at suspected German sabotage of <a href="Black_Tom_explosion" title="wikilink">Black Tom</a> in <a href="Jersey_City,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Jersey City, New Jersey</a>, and the <a href="Kingsland_Explosion" title="wikilink">Kingsland Explosion</a>.</p>

<h4 id="german-spring-offensive-of-1918">German Spring Offensive of 1918</h4>

<p>German General <a href="Erich_Ludendorff" title="wikilink">Erich Ludendorff</a> drew up plans (<a href="Code_name" title="wikilink">codenamed</a> <a href="Operation_Michael" title="wikilink">Operation Michael</a>) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U.S. forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near <a href="Amiens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amiens</a>. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (40 miles).<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>British and French trenches were penetrated using novel <a href="infiltration_tactics" title="wikilink">infiltration tactics</a>, also named <em>Hutier</em> tactics, after General <a href="Oskar_von_Hutier" title="wikilink">Oskar von Hutier</a>. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>The front moved to within 120 kilometres (75 mi) of Paris. Three heavy <a href="Krupp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krupp</a> <a href="railway_gun" title="wikilink">railway guns</a> fired 183 shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a <a href="Public_holiday" title="wikilink">national holiday</a>. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or <a href="Self-propelled_artillery" title="wikilink">motorised artillery</a>, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The sudden stop was also a result of the four <a href="Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) divisions that were &quot;rushed&quot; down, thus doing what no other army had done and stopping the German advance in its tracks. During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough. <img src="British_55th_Division_gas_casualties_10_April_1918.jpg" title="fig:British 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division troops blinded by tear gas during the Battle of Estaires, 10 April 1918." alt="British 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division troops blinded by tear gas during the Battle of Estaires, 10 April 1918." /></p>
<p><a href="Ferdinand_Foch" title="wikilink">General Foch</a> pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements. Pershing sought instead to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the <a href="Doullens_Conference" title="wikilink">Doullens Conference</a> on 5 November 1917.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. Haig, Petain and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating role, rather than a directing role and the British, French and U.S. commands operated largely independently.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Following Operation Michael, Germany launched <a href="Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)" title="wikilink">Operation Georgette</a> against the northern <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> ports. The Allies halted the drive with limited territorial gains for Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted <a href="Third_Battle_of_the_Aisne" title="wikilink">Operations Bl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher and Yorck</a>, broadly towards Paris. Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, attempting to encircle <a href="Reims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reims</a> and beginning the <a href="Second_Battle_of_the_Marne" title="wikilink">Second Battle of the Marne</a>. The resulting counterattack, starting the <a href="Hundred_Days_Offensive" title="wikilink">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, marked their first successful Allied offensive of the war.</p>
<p>By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines,<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the war in the West, the German Army never again regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. <a href="Anti-war" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anti-war</a> marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was 53 percent of 1913 levels.</p>

Although the Armenians managed to inflict one defeat on the Ottomans at the <a href="Battle_of_Sardarabad" title="wikilink">Battle of Sardarabad</a>, the Ottoman army won a later battle and scattered the Armenian army.

<p>The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918. The <a href="Battle_of_Amiens_(1918)" title="wikilink">Battle of Amiens</a> developed with III Corps <a href="British_Fourth_Army" title="wikilink">British Fourth Army</a> on the left, the <a href="French_First_Army" title="wikilink">French First Army</a> on the right, and the <a href="Australian_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian</a> and <a href="Canadian_Corps" title="wikilink">Canadian Corps</a> spearheading the offensive in the centre through <a href="Harbonni&lt;U+00E8&gt;res" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harbonni&lt;U+00E8&gt;res</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> It involved 414 tanks of the <a href="Mark_I_tank" title="wikilink">Mark IV</a> and <a href="Mark_V_(tank)#Mark_V_series" title="wikilink">Mark V</a> type, and 120,000 men. They advanced 12 kilometres (7 miles) into German-held territory in just seven hours. Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the &quot;Black Day of the German army&quot;.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>The Australian-Canadian spearhead at Amiens, a battle that was the beginning of Germany&lt;U+2019&gt;s downfall,<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> helped pull the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south forward. While German resistance on the British Fourth Army front at Amiens stiffened, after an advance as far as  and concluded the battle there, the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10 August, when it was thrown in on the right of the French First Army, and advanced  liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16 August. South of the French Third Army, General <a href="Charles_Mangin" title="wikilink">Charles Mangin</a> (The Butcher) drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners, two hundred guns and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Another &quot;Black day&quot; as described by Erich Ludendorff.</p>
<p>Meanwhile General Byng of the Third British Army, reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal, was ordered to attack with 200 tanks towards Bapaume, opening the <a href="Battle_of_Albert_(1918)" title="wikilink">Battle of Albert</a>, with the specific orders of &quot;To break the enemy's front, in order to outflank the enemies present battle front&quot; (opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens).<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. Attacks were being undertaken in quick order to take advantage of the successful advances on the flanks and then broken off when that attack lost its initial impetus.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>The British Third Army's  front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Rawlinson&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fourth British Army was able to battle its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> On 26 August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle extending it northward to beyond Arras. The Canadian Corps already being back in the vanguard of the <a href="First_Army_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">First Army</a> fought their way from Arras eastward  astride the heavily defended Arras-Cambrai before reaching the outer defences of the <a href="Hindenburg_Line" title="wikilink">Hindenburg Line</a>, breaching them on the 28 and 29 August. Bapaume fell on the 29 August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army and the Australians, still leading the advance of the Fourth Army, were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and <a href="Mont_Saint-Quentin" title="wikilink">Mont Saint-Quentin</a> on 31 August. Further south the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army, who had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames, was now near to the Alberich position of the Hindenburg Line.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> During the last week of August the pressure along a  front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting.

That same day <a href="Oberste_Heeresleitung" title="wikilink">Oberste Heeresleitung</a> (OHL) had no choice but to issue orders to six armies for withdrawal back into the Hindenburg Line in the south, behind the <a href="Canal_du_Nord" title="wikilink">Canal du Nord</a> on the Canadian-First Army's front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north, giving up without a fight the salient seized in the previous April.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> According to <a href="Erich_Ludendorff" title="wikilink">Ludendorff</a> &lt;U+201C&gt;We had to admit the necessity ... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>In nearly four weeks of fighting since 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the <a href="British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">BEF</a> and the rest by the French. Since &quot;The Black Day of the German Army&quot; the German High Command realised the war was lost and made attempts for a satisfactory end. The day after the battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz &quot;We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.&quot; On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it and replied, &quot;I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended.&quot; On 13 August at <a href="Spa,_Belgium" title="wikilink">Spa</a>, Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Chancellor and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and on the following day the German Crown Council decided victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations, to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the mediation of the Queen of the Netherlands. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden &quot;Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier.&quot; On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On the 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected and on 24 September <a href="Oberste_Heeresleitung" title="wikilink">OHL</a> informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear guard actions and launching numerous counter attacks on lost positions, with only a few succeeding and then only temporarily. Contested towns, villages, heights and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 prisoners in the last week of September. Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army victory at Ivincourt on 12 September, the Fourth Armies at Epheny on 18 September and the French gain of <a href="Essigny-le-Grand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essigny-le-Grand</a> a day later. On 24 September a final assault by both the British and French on a 4 mile (6 km) front would come within 2 miles (3 km) of St. Quentin.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg Line. With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north the time had now come for an assault on the whole length of the line.</p>
<p>The Allied <a href="Meuse-Argonne_Offensive" title="wikilink">attack on the Hindenburg Line</a> began on 26 September including U.S. soldiers. The still-green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in <a href="Champagne,_France" title="wikilink">Champagne</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Blanc_Mont_Ridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge</a>, forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent, which the Germans held as a pivot until Allied artillery was brought up.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions.</p>
<p>When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece. Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral <a href="Reinhard_Scheer" title="wikilink">Reinhard Scheer</a> and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the &quot;valour&quot; of the German Navy. Knowing the government of <a href="Prince_Maximilian_of_Baden" title="wikilink">Prince Maximilian of Baden</a> would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at <a href="Kiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kiel</a>. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal. Ludendorff took the blame&lt;U+2014&gt;the Kaiser dismissed him on 26 October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. The reserves had been used up, but U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>Having suffered over 6 million casualties, Germany moved towards peace. <a href="Prince_Maximilian_of_Baden" title="wikilink">Prince Maximilian of Baden</a> took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that better terms would be offered than by the British and French.

There was no resistance when the <a href="Social_Democratic" title="wikilink">social democrat</a> <a href="Philipp_Scheidemann" title="wikilink">Philipp Scheidemann</a> on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic.

<p>On 24 October, the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the <a href="Battle_of_Caporetto" title="wikilink">Battle of Caporetto</a>. This culminated in the <a href="Battle_of_Vittorio_Veneto" title="wikilink">Battle of Vittorio Veneto</a>, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine and Trieste. On 3 November Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary sent a <a href="White_flag" title="wikilink">flag of truce</a> to ask for an <a href="Armistice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armistice</a>. The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian Commander and accepted.

Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the <a href="Habsburg_Monarchy" title="wikilink">Habsburg Monarchy</a>.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="German_Revolution_of_1918&lt;U+2013&gt;19" title="wikilink">German Revolution</a>, a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. The <a href="Kaiser" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiser</a> fled to the Netherlands.

<p>In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and <a href="materiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">materiel</a> to invade Germany, yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier and Berlin was still almost  from the Western Front. The Kaiser's armies had also retreated from the battlefield in good order which enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the <a href="stab-in-the-back_legend" title="wikilink">stab-in-the-back legend</a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> which attributed Germany's losing the war not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the <a href="1918_flu_pandemic" title="wikilink">1918 flu pandemic</a> and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its &quot;patriotic calling&quot; and the intentional sabotaging of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists and Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until signing of the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> with Germany on 28 June 1919. Later treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the <a href="Turkish_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Turkish War of Independence</a>) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the <a href="Republic_of_Turkey" title="wikilink">Republic of Turkey</a>, at <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Lausanne</a> on 24 July 1923.</p>
<p>Some <a href="war_memorial" title="wikilink">war memorials</a> date the end of the war as being when the Versailles treaty was signed in 1919; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally the last formal peace treaties were not signed until the Treaty of Lausanne. Under its terms, the Allied forces divested <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> on 23 August 1923.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p><img src="Armoured_car.jpg" title="fig:Armoured cars" alt="Armoured cars" /> The First World War began as a clash of 20-century <a href="technology" class="uri" title="wikilink">technology</a> and 19th-century <a href="military_tactics" title="wikilink">tactics</a>, with inevitably large casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, <a href="Wireless" title="wikilink">wireless communication</a>,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> <a href="Armored_car_(military)" title="wikilink">armoured cars</a>, <a href="tanks" class="uri" title="wikilink">tanks</a>,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> and <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a>. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100 man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre. Instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution.</p>
<p>In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, <a href="indirect_fire" title="wikilink">indirect fire</a> with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked <a href="field_telephone" title="wikilink">field telephone</a>. <a href="Counter-battery_fire" title="wikilink">Counter-battery</a> missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.</p>
<p>Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire. She employed 150 and 210 mm <a href="howitzer" title="wikilink">howitzers</a> in 1914 when the typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105 mm. The British had a 6 inch (152 mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. Germans also fielded Austrian 305 mm and 420 mm guns, and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of <em><a href="Minenwerfer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minenwerfer</a></em> ideally suited for trench warfare.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Much of the combat involved <a href="trench_warfare" title="wikilink">trench warfare</a>, where hundreds often died for each yard gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include <a href="Battle_of_Passchendaele" title="wikilink">Ypres</a>, the <a href="First_Battle_of_the_Marne" title="wikilink">Marne</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Cambrai_(1917)" title="wikilink">Cambrai</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_the_Somme" title="wikilink">Somme</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Verdun" title="wikilink">Verdun</a>, and <a href="Gallipoli_Campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a>. The <a href="Haber_process" title="wikilink">Haber process</a> of <a href="nitrogen_fixation" title="wikilink">nitrogen fixation</a> was employed to provide the German forces with a constant supply of gunpowder, in the face of British naval blockade.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head-wounds caused by exploding shells and <a href="Fragmentation_(weaponry)" title="wikilink">fragmentation</a> forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel <a href="helmet" class="uri" title="wikilink">helmet</a>, led by the French, who introduced the <a href="Adrian_helmet" title="wikilink">Adrian helmet</a> in 1915.

<p><a href="Fixed-wing_aircraft" title="wikilink">Fixed-wing aircraft</a> were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya 23 October 1911 during the <a href="Italo-Turkish_War" title="wikilink">Italo-Turkish War</a> for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and <a href="aerial_photography" title="wikilink">aerial photography</a> the next year. By 1914 the military utility was obvious. They were initially used for <a href="reconnaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">reconnaissance</a> and <a href="Close_air_support" title="wikilink">ground attack</a>. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and <a href="fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighter aircraft</a> were developed. <a href="Strategic_bombers" title="wikilink">Strategic bombers</a> were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used <a href="Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Zeppelins</a> as well.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Towards the end of the conflict, <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a> were used for the first time, with <a href="HMS_Furious_(47)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Furious</em></a> launching <a href="Sopwith_Camels" title="wikilink">Sopwith Camels</a> in <a href="Tondern_raid" title="wikilink">a raid</a> to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at <a href="Tondern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tondern</a> in 1918.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> <img src="Nieuport_w_Le_Prieur_rockets.jpg" title="fig:Johnson&#39;s Nieuport 16 armed with Le Prieur rockets for attacking observation balloons." alt="Johnson&#39;s Nieuport 16 armed with Le Prieur rockets for attacking observation balloons." /> German <a href="U-boat" title="wikilink">U-boats</a> (<a href="submarines" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarines</a>) were deployed after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, they were employed by the <a href="Kaiserliche_Marine" title="wikilink">Kaiserliche Marine</a> in a strategy to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), <a href="hydrophone" title="wikilink">hydrophones</a> (passive <a href="sonar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonar</a>, 1917), <a href="blimp" title="wikilink">blimps</a>, <a href="Hunter-killer_armored-vehicle_team" title="wikilink">hunter-killer</a> submarines (<a href="British_R_class_submarine" title="wikilink">HMS <em>R&amp;-1</em></a>, 1917), forward-throwing <a href="anti-submarine_weapon" title="wikilink">anti-submarine weapons</a>, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the <a href="interwar_period" title="wikilink">interwar period</a> until World War II revived the need.</p>
<p><img src="Vickers_IWW.jpg" title="fig:British Vickers machine gun" alt="British Vickers machine gun" /> Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation <a href="Shell_(projectile)" title="wikilink">shells</a> helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British sought a solution with the creation of the tank and <a href="mechanised_warfare" title="wikilink">mechanised warfare</a>. The <a href="Mark_I_(tank)" title="wikilink">first tanks</a> were used during the <a href="Battle_of_the_Somme" title="wikilink">Battle of the Somme</a> on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability became an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the <a href="Battle_of_Cambrai_(1917)" title="wikilink">Battle of Cambrai</a> in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while <a href="combined_arms" title="wikilink">combined arms</a> teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100 guns. <a href="Light_machine_gun" title="wikilink">Light automatic weapons</a> and <a href="submachine_guns" title="wikilink">submachine guns</a> were also introduced during the conflict, such as the <a href="Lewis_Gun" title="wikilink">Lewis Gun</a>, the <a href="Browning_Automatic_Rifle" title="wikilink">Browning automatic rifle</a>, and the <a href="Bergmann_MP18" title="wikilink">Bergmann MP18</a>.</p>
<p>Manned <a href="observation_balloon" title="wikilink">observation balloons</a>, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with <a href="parachute" title="wikilink">parachutes</a>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> If there was an enemy air attack, the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output) and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. <img src="Battle_of_Messines_-_destroyed_German_trench.jpg" title="fig:German trench destroyed by a mine explosion. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the 19 mines were simultaneously detonated." alt="German trench destroyed by a mine explosion. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the 19 mines were simultaneously detonated." /> To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. Blimps and balloons contributed to air-to-air combat among aircraft, because of their reconnaissance value, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines. The resulting panic took several squadrons of fighters from France.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Another new weapon, <a href="flamethrower" title="wikilink">flamethrowers</a>, were first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, they were a powerful, demoralising weapon and caused terror on the battlefield. It was a dangerous weapon to wield, as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets.</p>
<p><a href="Trench_railways" title="wikilink">Trench railways</a> evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for wheeled vehicles eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.</p>

All nations pledged to follow the Hague Convention on fair treatment of <a href="prisoners_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoners of war</a>. A POW's rate of survival was generally much higher than their peers at the front.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Individual surrenders were uncommon. Large units usually surrendered en masse. At the <a href="Battle_of_Tannenberg_(1914)" title="wikilink">Battle of Tannenberg</a> 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of <a href="Kaunas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaunas</a> surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half of Russian losses were prisoners (as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed); for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million (not including Russia, which lost 2.-3.5 million men as prisoners.) From the Central Powers about 3.3 million men became prisoners.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>Germany held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.9 million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just prior to the Armistice. The U.S. held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Once prisoners reached a camp, in general, conditions were satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the <a href="International_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">International Red Cross</a> and inspections by neutral nations. Conditions were terrible in Russia, <a href="starvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">starvation</a> was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15&lt;U+2013&gt;20% of the prisoners in Russia died.

<p>The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the <a href="Siege_of_Kut" title="wikilink">Siege of Kut</a>, in <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>, in April 1916, 4,250 died in captivity.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Although many were in very bad condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march  to <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a>.

<p>While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of which had to serve as <a href="forced_labor" title="wikilink">forced labor</a>, e.g. in France until 1920.

<h3 id="military-attachu00e9s-and-war-correspondents">Military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and war correspondents</h3>

<p>Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern &quot;<a href="embedded_journalist" title="wikilink">embedded</a>&quot; positions within the opposing land and naval forces. These military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and other observers prepared voluminous first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers.</p>
<p>For example, former U.S. Army Captain <a href="Granville_Roland_Fortescue" title="wikilink">Granville Fortescue</a> followed the developments of the <a href="Gallipoli_Campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli Campaign</a> from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders; and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> However, this observer's role was abandoned when the U.S. entered the war, as Fortescue immediately re-enlisted, sustaining wounds at <a href="Forest_of_Argonne" title="wikilink">Forest of Argonne</a> in the <a href="Meuse-Argonne_Offensive" title="wikilink">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a>, September 1918.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was not the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. The <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a> had been closely observed by Military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, war correspondents and other observers; but, from a 21st century perspective, it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Middle East, <a href="Arab_nationalism" title="wikilink">Arab nationalism</a> soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a <a href="Pan-Arabism" title="wikilink">pan-Arab</a> state.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> In 1916, the <a href="Arab_Revolt" title="wikilink">Arab Revolt</a> began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Italian_nationalism" title="wikilink">Italian nationalism</a> was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions.

Once war was declared, however, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the <a href="Bolshevik" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a>, the <a href="Socialist_Party_of_America" title="wikilink">Socialist Party of America</a>, and the <a href="Italian_Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Italian Socialist Party</a>, and individuals such as <a href="Karl_Liebknecht" title="wikilink">Karl Liebknecht</a>, <a href="Rosa_Luxemburg" title="wikilink">Rosa Luxemburg</a> and their followers in Germany. There were also small anti-war groups in Britain and France.</p>
<p>In <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">Britain</a>, in 1914, the <a href="Public_Schools_Act_1868" title="wikilink">Public Schools</a> <a href="Officers&#39;_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">Officers' Training Corps</a> annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near <a href="Salisbury_Plain" title="wikilink">Salisbury Plain</a>.

In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust-probably not more than one-quarter of us - learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.</em> <a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Having voiced these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorien's career, or preventing him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities.</p>

<p>A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists held hostility to. <a href="Irish_nationalism" title="wikilink">Irish nationalists</a> staunchly opposed taking part in intervention with the <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The war had begun amid the Home Rule crisis in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> that had begun in 1912 and by 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of <a href="civil_war" title="wikilink">civil war</a> in Ireland between Irish unionists and republicans.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the <a href="Easter_Rising" title="wikilink">Easter Rising</a> of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland in order to stir unrest in the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> The UK government placed Ireland under <a href="martial_law" title="wikilink">martial law</a> in response to the Easter Rising.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="conscription">Conscription</h4>
<p>As the war slowly turned into a <a href="Attrition_warfare" title="wikilink">war of attrition</a>, <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a> was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia. In the former it opened a political gap between French-Canadians, who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire, and the Anglophone majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada. Prime Minister <a href="Robert_Borden" title="wikilink">Robert Borden</a> pushed through a <a href="Military_Service_Act_(Canada)" title="wikilink">Military Service Act</a>, provoking the <a href="Conscription_Crisis_of_1917" title="wikilink">Conscription Crisis of 1917</a>. In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by Prime Minister <a href="Billy_Hughes" title="wikilink">Billy Hughes</a>, caused a split in the <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Australian Labor Party</a> and Hughes formed the <a href="Nationalist_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Nationalist Party of Australia</a> in 1917 to pursue the matter. Nevertheless, the <a href="labour_movement" title="wikilink">labour movement</a>, the Catholic Church, and <a href="Irish_republican" title="wikilink">Irish nationalist</a> expatriates successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was <a href="Australian_plebiscite,_1917" title="wikilink">rejected in two plebiscites</a>.</p>
<p>Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man in Britain, six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>

<p>After the war, the <a href="Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Conference</a> imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers. The 1919 <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> officially ended the war. Building on <a href="Fourteen_Points" title="wikilink">Wilson's 14th point</a>, the Treaty of Versailles also brought into being the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> on 28 June 1919.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>In signing the treaty, Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war, agreeing to pay enormous <a href="war_reparations" title="wikilink">war reparations</a> and award territory to the victors. The &quot;Guilt Thesis&quot; became a controversial explanation of later events among analysts in Britain and the United States. The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the <a href="Nazi" title="wikilink">Nazis</a>, exploited with a <a href="conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy theory</a> they called the <em>Dolchstosslegende</em> (<a href="Stab-in-the-back_legend" title="wikilink">Stab-in-the-back legend</a>). The <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a> lost the former <a href="German_colonial_empire" title="wikilink">colonial possessions</a> and was saddled with accepting blame for the war, as well as paying punitive <a href="World_War_I_reparations" title="wikilink">reparations</a> for it. Unable to pay them with exports (a result of territorial losses and postwar recession),<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> Germany did so by borrowing from the United States. Runaway inflation in the 1920s contributed to the economic collapse of the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a> and the reparations were suspended in 1931 following the <a href="Stock_Market_Crash" title="wikilink">Stock Market Crash</a> in 1929 and the beginnings of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, and <a href="Yugoslavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a>, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> was shifted from <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> to <a href="Greater_Romania" title="wikilink">Greater Romania</a>. The details were contained in the <a href="Treaty_of_Saint-Germain" title="wikilink">Treaty of Saint-Germain</a> and the <a href="Treaty_of_Trianon" title="wikilink">Treaty of Trianon</a>. As a result of the <a href="Treaty_of_Trianon" title="wikilink">Treaty of Trianon</a>, 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war <a href="Kingdom_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="Yugoslavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a>.</p>
<p>The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a>, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, Finland, <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a>, and <a href="Second_Polish_Republic" title="wikilink">Poland</a> were carved from it. <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a> was re-attached to the <a href="Greater_Romania" title="wikilink">Greater Romania</a>, as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-<a href="Anatolia" title="wikilink">Anatolian</a> territory was awarded as protectorates of various Allied powers. The Turkish core was reorganised as the <a href="Turkey" title="wikilink">Republic of Turkey</a>. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the <a href="Treaty_of_S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres" title="wikilink">Treaty of S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres</a> in 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the <a href="Turkish_republican_movement" title="wikilink">Turkish republican movement</a>, leading to the <a href="Turkish_Independence_War" title="wikilink">Turkish Independence War</a> and, ultimately, to the 1923 <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lausanne</a>.</p>

<p>The First World War had a lasting impact on social memory.

<p>This has become the most common perception of the First World War, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems and stories published subsequently. Films such as <em><a href="All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front" title="wikilink">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></em>, <em><a href="Paths_of_Glory" title="wikilink">Paths of Glory</a></em> and <em><a href="For_King_and_Country" title="wikilink">For King and Country</a></em> have perpetuated the idea; while war-time films including <em>Camrades</em>, <em>Flanders Poppies</em> and <em><a href="Shoulder_Arms" title="wikilink">Shoulder Arms</a></em> indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> Likewise, the art of <a href="Paul_Nash_(artist)" title="wikilink">Paul Nash</a>, <a href="John_Nash_(artist)" title="wikilink">John Nash</a>, <a href="Christopher_Nevison" title="wikilink">Christopher Nevison</a> and <a href="Henry_Tonks" title="wikilink">Henry Tonks</a> in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as <a href="Muirhead_Bone" title="wikilink">Muirhead Bone</a> painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Several historians have since countered these interpretations: <img src="Siegfried_Sassoon_by_George_Charles_Beresford_(1915).jpg" title="fig:Siegfried Sassoon (May 1915)" alt="Siegfried Sassoon (May 1915)" /></p>

<p>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular clich&lt;U+00E9&gt; of the First World War. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less <a href="liberal_democracy" title="wikilink">liberal democracy</a>. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="discontent-in-germany">Discontent in Germany</h3>
<p>The rise of <a href="Nazism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazism</a> and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the <a href="Stab-in-the-back_legend" title="wikilink">Stab-in-the-back legend</a> (German: <em>Dolchsto&lt;U+00DF&gt;legende</em>) was a testament to the <a href="Mental_health" title="wikilink">psychological state</a> of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This <a href="conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy theory</a> of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The <em>Dolchsto&lt;U+00DF&gt;legende</em>'s popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism. A sense of disillusionment and <a href="cynicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cynicism</a> became pronounced, with <a href="nihilism" class="uri" title="wikilink">nihilism</a> growing.

<p>Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity.

Out of German discontent with the still controversial <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a>, <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> was able to gain popularity and power.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a><a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by the First World War; in fact, it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a><a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a><a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>

<p>U.S. intervention in the war, as well as the Wilson administration, became deeply unpopular.

Polls taken in 1937 and the opening months of World War II established that nearly 60% regarded the intervention as a mistake, with only 28% opposing that view. But, in the period between the <a href="fall_of_France" title="wikilink">fall of France</a> and the <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, public opinion changed dramatically and, for the first time, a narrow plurality rejected the idea that the war was a mistake.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> reemerged as an independent country, after more than a century. As a &quot;minor Entente nation&quot; and the country with the largest casualties per head<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a><a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a><a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a> and its dynasty became the backbone of the new multinational state, the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later renamed <a href="Yugoslavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a>). <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a> became a new nation. Russia became the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and lost <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a>, <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a>, <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a>, which became independent countries. The <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> was soon replaced by <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> and several other countries in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the <a href="Gallipoli_Campaign" title="wikilink">Battle of Gallipoli</a> became known as those nations' &quot;Baptism of Fire&quot;. It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the <a href="British_Crown" title="wikilink">British Crown</a>. <a href="Anzac_Day" title="wikilink">Anzac Day</a>, commemorating the <a href="Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a>, celebrates this defining moment.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a><a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>
<p>After the <a href="Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a>, where the Canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, Canadians began to refer to theirs as a nation &quot;forged from fire&quot;.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a> Having succeeded on the same battleground where the &quot;mother countries&quot; had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments. Canada entered the war as a Dominion of the British Empire and remained so afterwards, although she emerged with a greater measure of independence.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a><a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> While the other Dominions were represented by Britain, Canada was an independent negotiator and signatory of the <a href="Versailles_Treaty" title="wikilink">Versailles Treaty</a>.</p>
<h3 id="economic-effects">Economic effects</h3>
<p>One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the <a href="war_effort" title="wikilink">war effort</a>; many of which have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratised governments such as in Austria&lt;U+2013&gt;Hungary and Germany; however, any analysis of the long-term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments. <img src="Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-00104,_Inflation,_Tapezieren_mit_Geldscheinen.jpg" title="fig:Germany, 1923: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper. Millions of middle-class Germans were ruined by the hyperinflation. When the war began in 1914, a dollar was worth 4.2 marks. By November 1923, the dollar was at 4.2 trillion marks." alt="Germany, 1923: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper. Millions of middle-class Germans were ruined by the hyperinflation. When the war began in 1914, a dollar was worth 4.2 marks. By November 1923, the dollar was at 4.2 trillion marks." /> <a href="Gross_domestic_product" title="wikilink">Gross domestic product</a> (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war's end, there was no meat.</p>
<p>All nations had increases in the government's share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on <a href="Wall_Street" title="wikilink">Wall Street</a>. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. government</a> lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid. In 1934, Britain owed the US $4.4 <a href="1000000000_(number)" title="wikilink">billion</a><a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> of World War I debt.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="The_Girl_Behind_the_Gun_1915.jpg" title="fig:&quot;The Girl Behind the Gun&quot; - women workers, 1915" alt="&quot;The Girl Behind the Gun&quot; - women workers, 1915" /> Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for <a href="suffragette" title="wikilink">voting rights for women</a>.</p>
<p>In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and <a href="Margarine" title="wikilink">oleo</a>), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917&lt;U+2013&gt;1918 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays and inadequate housing.</p>
<p>Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. Geologists such as <a href="Albert_Ernest_Kitson" title="wikilink">Albert Ernest Kitson</a> were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of <a href="manganese" class="uri" title="wikilink">manganese</a>, used in munitions production, in the <a href="Gold_Coast_(region)" title="wikilink">Gold Coast</a>.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Article_231_of_the_Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Article 231</a> of the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> (the so-called &quot;war guilt&quot; clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all &quot;loss and damage&quot; suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for <a href="World_War_I_reparations" title="wikilink">reparations</a>. The total reparations demanded was 132 billion gold marks which was far more than the total German gold or foreign exchange. The economic problems that the payments brought, and German resentment at their imposition, are usually cited as one of the more significant factors that led to the end of the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a> and the beginning of the dictatorship of <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>. After Germany&lt;U+2019&gt;s defeat in World War II, payment of the reparations was not resumed. There was, however, outstanding German debt that the Weimar Republic had used to pay the reparations. Germany finished paying off the reparations in October 2010.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
