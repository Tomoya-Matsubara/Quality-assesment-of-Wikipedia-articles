<p><strong><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Cult_television" title="wikilink">cult</a> <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a> that first aired from <a href="March_10" title="wikilink">March 10</a>, <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a> until <a href="May_20" title="wikilink">May 20</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>. Writer-director <a href="Joss_Whedon" title="wikilink">Joss Whedon</a> created the concept and TV series under his production tag, <a href="Mutant_Enemy_Productions" title="wikilink">Mutant Enemy</a>. The series follows the life of <a href="Buffy_Summers" title="wikilink">Buffy Anne Summers</a> (played by <a href="Sarah_Michelle_Gellar" title="wikilink">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>), the latest in a line of young women chosen to battle against <a href="Vampire_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">vampires</a>, <a href="Demon_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">demons</a> and the forces of darkness. Like previous <a href="Slayer_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">slayers</a>, Buffy is aided by a <a href="Watcher_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Watcher</a> who guides and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the &quot;<a href="Scooby_Gang" title="wikilink">Scooby Gang</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The series usually reached between two and four million viewers on original airings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Although such <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">ratings</a> are lower than successful shows on the &quot;big four&quot; networks (<a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>, <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>, <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> and <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a>),<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller <a href="Warner_Brothers_Network" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers Network</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Reviews for the show were overwhelmingly positive,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and was it was ranked #41 on the list of <a href="TV_Guide&#39;s_50_Greatest_TV_Shows_of_All_Time" title="wikilink">TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time</a>.

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>Writer Joss Whedon developed <em>Buffy</em> to invert the Hollywood formula of &quot;the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror movie</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Whedon wanted &quot;to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He explained:</p>

<p>The concept was first visited through Whedon's script for the <a href="Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(film)" title="wikilink">1992 movie, <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>, which featured <a href="Kristy_Swanson" title="wikilink">Kristy Swanson</a> in the title role. The director saw it as a &quot;pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Whedon disagreed; &quot;I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The script was recognised within the industry,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> but the movie was not.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Several years later, <a href="Gail_Berman" title="wikilink">Gail Berman</a>, a Sandollar Productions executive approached Joss Whedon to develop his <em>Buffy</em> concept into a television series.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Whedon explained that &quot;They said, &lt;U+2018&gt;Do you want to do a show?&lt;U+2019&gt; And I thought, &lt;U+2018&gt;High school as a horror movie.&lt;U+2019&gt; And so the metaphor became the central concept behind <em>Buffy</em>, and that&lt;U+2019&gt;s how I sold it.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with <a href="adolescence" class="uri" title="wikilink">adolescence</a> and young adulthood.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute <a href="Unaired_pilot_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">unaired <em>Buffy</em> pilot</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network who promoted the premiere with a series of <a href="History_of_the_Slayer" title="wikilink"><em>History of the Slayer</em> clips</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The <a href="Welcome_to_the_Hellmouth" title="wikilink">first episode</a> aired on <a href="March_10" title="wikilink">March 10</a>, <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>.</p>
<h3 id="executive-producers">Executive producers</h3>
<p>Joss Whedon was credited as <a href="executive_producer" title="wikilink">executive producer</a> throughout the run of the series.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> For the first five seasons (1997-2001) he was also the <a href="show_runner" title="wikilink">show runner</a>. This role involves serving as head writer and being responsible for every aspect of production. <a href="Marti_Noxon" title="wikilink">Marti Noxon</a> took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001-2003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing <em>Buffy</em> alongside projects such as <em><a href="Angel_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Angel</a></em>, <em><a href="Fray" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fray</a></em> and <em><a href="Firefly_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Firefly</a></em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="Fran_Rubel_Kuzui" title="wikilink">Fran Rubel Kuzui</a> and her husband, <a href="Kaz_Kuzui" title="wikilink">Kaz Kuzui</a> were credited as executive producers<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but were not heavily involved in the show. Their credit, rights and royalties over the franchise relate to their funding, producing and directing of the original movie version of <em>Buffy</em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>Script-writing was done by <a href="Mutant_Enemy_Productions" title="wikilink">Mutant Enemy</a>, a production company created by Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits include: <a href="Steven_S._DeKnight" title="wikilink">Steven S. DeKnight</a>, <a href="Jane_Espenson" title="wikilink">Jane Espenson</a>, <a href="David_Fury" title="wikilink">David Fury</a>, <a href="Drew_Goddard" title="wikilink">Drew Goddard</a>, <a href="Drew_Greenberg" title="wikilink">Drew Greenberg</a>, <a href="Rebecca_Rand_Kirshner" title="wikilink">Rebecca Rand Kirshner</a>, <a href="Marti_Noxon" title="wikilink">Marti Noxon</a> and <a href="Doug_Petrie" title="wikilink">Doug Petrie</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> First, the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural. Then the episode's story was 'broken' into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode through advertisements. The writers collectively &quot;filled in&quot; scenes surrounding these actbreaks for a more fleshed out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once 'breaking' was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer wrote a full script which went through a quick rewrite from the show runner. The final article was used as the shooting script.</p>

<p>Four roles were cast before the series aired. The title role went to <a href="Sarah_Michelle_Gellar" title="wikilink">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge in <em><a href="Swan&#39;s_Crossing" title="wikilink">Swan's Crossing</a></em> and <a href="Kendall_Hart" title="wikilink">Kendall Hart</a> in <em><a href="All_My_Children" title="wikilink">All My Children</a></em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> At age eighteen in 1995, Gellar had already won a <a href="Daytime_Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Daytime Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1996 she was initially cast as <a href="Cordelia_Chase" title="wikilink">Cordelia Chase</a> during a week of auditioning.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Anthony_Stewart_Head" title="wikilink">Anthony Stewart Head</a> had already led a prolific acting and singing career<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> but remained best known for a series of twelve coffee commercials with <a href="Sharon_Maughan" title="wikilink">Sharon Maughan</a> for <a href="Nescaf&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nescaf&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> Gold Blend.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He accepted the role of <a href="Rupert_Giles" title="wikilink">Rupert Giles</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike other <em>Buffy</em> regulars, <a href="Nicholas_Brendon" title="wikilink">Nicholas Brendon</a> had little acting experience,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> instead working various jobs &lt;U+2014&gt; including production assistant, plumber's assistant, veterinary janitor, food delivery, script delivery, day care counselor and waiter &lt;U+2014&gt; before deciding to break into acting to help him overcome a stutter.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He landed his <a href="Xander_Harris" title="wikilink">Xander Harris</a> role following only four days of auditioning.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Alyson_Hannigan" title="wikilink">Alyson Hannigan</a> was the last of the original four to be cast. Following her role in <em><a href="My_Stepmother_Is_an_Alien" title="wikilink">My Stepmother Is an Alien</a></em>,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 1996 the role of <a href="Willow_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Willow Rosenberg</a> was initially given to Riff Regan for the <a href="Unaired_pilot_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">unaired <em>Buffy</em> pilot</a> but Hannigan auditioned when the role was recast for the series proper. She described her approach to auditions in an interview through her approach to a particular moment: Willow tells Buffy that her <a href="Barbie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbie</a> doll was taken from her as a child, and Buffy asks if she ever got the Barbie back. &quot;Willow's line was 'Most of it.' And so I thought I'm gonna make that a really happy thing. I was so proud that she got most of it back. That clued in on how I was going to play the rest of the scene. It defines the character.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Her approach subsequently helped her win the role.</p>
<h3 id="broadcasting">Broadcasting</h3>
<p><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> first aired on <a href="March_10" title="wikilink">March 10</a>, <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a> on the <a href="WB_Television_Network" title="wikilink">WB</a> network and played a key role in the growth of the <a href="Warner_Brothers" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers</a> <a href="television_network" title="wikilink">television network</a> in its early years.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network (<a href="UPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">UPN</a>) for its final two seasons. The show went into syndication in the U.S. on <a href="FX" class="uri" title="wikilink">FX</a>. In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on <a href="BBC2" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC2</a>. The BBC gave the show two time slots, an early-evening slot for a family-friendly version with violence and bad language cut out and a late-night uncut version.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format, but Whedon later said that <em>Buffy</em> had never intended to be viewed this way.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The seventh and final season was originally broadcast on UPN during 2002-2003. Sarah Michelle Gellar explained to <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> why she decided not to sign on for an eighth season, &quot;[When] we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought: 'This is how I want to go out, on top, at our best.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin-off series that would not require Gellar, this included a possible <a href="Undeveloped_Buffyverse_productions#Faith_the_Vampire_Slayer" title="wikilink">Faith series</a>, but nothing became of those plans.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="opening-sequence">Opening sequence</h3>
<p>The <em>Buffy</em> opening sequence provides credits early in each show. The music was performed by punk rock band <a href="Nerf_Herder" title="wikilink">Nerf Herder</a>. The song sounds similar to a German pop song from the Eighties called &quot;<a href="D&lt;U+00F6&gt;f#&quot;Codo&quot;" title="wikilink">Codo</a>&quot; by &quot;<a href="D&lt;U+00F6&gt;f" class="uri" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00F6&gt;f</a>&quot;, but Nerf Herder have said that thay had &quot;never heard of D&lt;U+00F6&gt;f&quot;, and the similarity was coicidental.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In the DVD commentary for the <a href="Welcome_to_the_Hellmouth_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">first <em>Buffy</em> episode</a>, Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder's theme was influenced by cast member <a href="Alyson_Hannigan" title="wikilink">Alyson Hannigan</a> who had made him listen to the band's music.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Janet Halfyard, in her essay &quot;Music, Gender, and Identity in <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and <em>Angel</em>&quot;, describes the opening:</p>

<p>But the theme changes; &quot;[The opening sequence] removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif, the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar, relocating itself in modern youth culture&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> This music is heard over images of a young cast involved in the action and turbulence of adolescence. The sequence provides a post-modern twist on the horror genre.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Alongside the score, most episodes featured indie rock music, usually at the characters' venue of choice, <a href="The_Bronze" title="wikilink">The Bronze</a>. <em>Buffy</em> Music Supervisor John King explained that &quot;we like to use unsigned bands&quot;, that &quot;you would believe would play in this place.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> For example, the group <a href="Four_Star_Mary" title="wikilink">Four Star Mary</a> were portrayed on screen by the fictional front <a href="Dingoes_Ate_My_Baby" title="wikilink">Dingoes Ate My Baby</a>. <a href="Pop_music" title="wikilink">Pop songs</a> by famous artists were rarely featured prominently, but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as <a href="Sarah_McLachlan" title="wikilink">Sarah McLachlan</a> (&quot;<a href="Surfacing_(album)#Track_listing" title="wikilink">Full of Grace</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Prayer_of_St._Francis" title="wikilink">Prayer of St. Francis</a>&quot;) and <a href="Michelle_Branch" title="wikilink">Michelle Branch</a> (&quot;<a href="The_Spirit_Room#Singles" title="wikilink">Goodbye to You</a>&quot;).

<p><em>Buffy</em> is told in a <a href="serial" title="wikilink">serialized</a> format, with each episode telling a self-containing story while contributing to a larger <a href="story_arc" title="wikilink">storyline</a>, which on Buffy is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful <a href="antagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">antagonist</a>, commonly referred to as the &quot;<a href="Big_and_little_bad" title="wikilink">Big Bad</a>&quot;.

Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an <a href="archetype" title="wikilink">archetypal</a> <a href="hero" class="uri" title="wikilink">hero</a>.</p>
<p>The most prominent monsters in the <a href="List_of_Buffyverse_villains_and_supernatural_beings" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> bestiary</a> are <a href="Vampire_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">vampires</a>, which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. Buffy and her companions fight a wide variety of <a href="Demon_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">demons</a>, as well as <a href="List_of_Buffyverse_villains_and_supernatural_beings#Ghosts_&amp;_Spirits" title="wikilink">ghosts</a>, <a href="Werewolf_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">werewolves</a>, <a href="List_of_Buffyverse_villains_and_supernatural_beings#Undead" title="wikilink">zombies</a>, and <a href="List_of_Buffyverse_villains_and_supernatural_beings#Mortals_Posing_Particular_Threat" title="wikilink">ethically unsound humans</a>. They frequently save the world from complete destruction. They use a combination of physical combat, <a href="magic_(paranormal)" title="wikilink">magic</a>, and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Buffy, Angel and later, Spike. Willow eventually becomes an adept <a href="Witch_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">witch</a>, while Giles contributes his extensive knowledge of demonology and supernatural lore.</p>
<h3 id="inspirations-and-metaphors">Inspirations and metaphors</h3>
<p>During the first year of the series, Whedon described the show as &quot;<em><a href="My_So-Called_Life" title="wikilink">My So-Called Life</a></em> meets <em><a href="The_X-Files" title="wikilink">The X-Files</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <em>My So-Called Life</em> gave a sympathetic portrayal of teen anxieties, in contrast, <em>The X-Files</em> delivered a supernatural &quot;monster of the week&quot; storyline. Alongside these series, Whedon has cited cult film <em><a href="Night_of_the_Comet" title="wikilink">Night of the Comet</a></em> as a &quot;big influence&quot;,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and credited the <em><a href="X-Men" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-Men</a></em> character <a href="Kitty_Pryde" title="wikilink">Kitty Pryde</a> as a significant influence on the character of Buffy.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The authors of unofficial guidebook <em><a href="List_of_Buffyverse_guidebooks#&quot;Dusted&quot;" title="wikilink">Dusted</a></em> point out that the series was often a <a href="pastiche" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastiche</a>, borrowing elements from previous horror novels, movies and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Nevitt &amp; Smith describe <em>Buffy</em>'s use of pastiche as &quot;post modern Gothic&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> For example, the <a href="Adam_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Adam</a> character parallels the <em><a href="Frankenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankenstein</a></em> monster, the episode &quot;<a href="Bad_Eggs_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">Bad Eggs</a>&quot; parallels <em><a href="Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers" title="wikilink">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a></em>, and so on.</p>
<p><em>Buffy</em> episodes include a deeper meaning or <a href="metaphor" class="uri" title="wikilink">metaphor</a> as well. Whedon explained, &quot;We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it&lt;U+2026&gt; it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of how a few episodes deal with real life issues turned into supernatural metaphors:</p>

<p>The love affair between the vampire <a href="Angel_(vampire)" title="wikilink">Angel</a> and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a>. <a href="Sarah_Michelle_Gellar" title="wikilink">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> said: &quot;That's the ultimate metaphor.

<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>


<p><a href="List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes#Season_1_(1997)" title="wikilink">The first season</a> exemplifies the &quot;high school as hell&quot; concept. Buffy Summers has just moved to <a href="Sunnydale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sunnydale</a> and hopes to escape her <a href="Slayer_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">slayer</a> duties. Her plans are complicated by <a href="Rupert_Giles" title="wikilink">Rupert Giles</a>, her new <a href="Watcher_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Watcher</a>, who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. <a href="Sunnydale_High" title="wikilink">Sunnydale High</a> is built atop a <a href="Hellmouth_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Hellmouth</a>, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy meets two schoolmates who will help fight evil through the series, but they must first prevent <a href="Master_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">an ancient and especially threatening vampire</a> from opening the Hellmouth and unleashing Hell on Earth.</p>
<p>The emotional stakes are raised in the <a href="List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes#Season_2_(1997_&lt;U+2013&gt;_1998)" title="wikilink">second season</a>.

<p>The <a href="List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes#Season_4_(1999_&lt;U+2013&gt;_2000)" title="wikilink">fourth season</a> sees Buffy and Willow enroll at <a href="University_of_California" title="wikilink">UC</a> Sunnydale while Xander joins the workforce.

They appear to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, but <a href="Adam_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">a secret project</a> goes horribly wrong. The season also marked the first year in which Joss Whedon oversaw other TV series.</p>
<p>During the <a href="List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes#Season_5_(2000_&lt;U+2013&gt;_2001)" title="wikilink">fifth season</a>, an <a href="Glory_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">exiled Hell-God</a> searches for a 'key' that will allow her to return to her home dimension.

When Willow's girlfriend is killed by a deranged murderer, Willow descends into darkness and begins a rampage.</p>
<p>The instability caused by Buffy's revival enables the <a href="First_Evil" title="wikilink">First Evil</a> to amass an army of powerful vampires against humankind during the <a href="List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes#Season_7_(2002_&lt;U+2013&gt;_2003)" title="wikilink">final season</a>.

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
<h3 id="main-characters">Main characters</h3>
<p><a href="Buffy_Anne_Summers" title="wikilink">Buffy Anne Summers</a> (played by <a href="Sarah_Michelle_Gellar" title="wikilink">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>) is &quot;<a href="Slayer_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">the Slayer</a>,&quot; one in a long line of young women chosen by fate to battle evil forces. This mystic calling endows her with a limited degree of <a href="clairvoyance" class="uri" title="wikilink">clairvoyance</a>, usually in the form of prophetic dreams, as well as dramatically increased physical strength, endurance, agility, intuition and ease of healing.</p>
<p>Buffy receives guidance from her <a href="Watcher_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Watcher</a>, <a href="Rupert_Giles" title="wikilink">Rupert Giles</a> (played by <a href="Anthony_Stewart_Head" title="wikilink">Anthony Stewart Head</a>). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name, is a member of the <a href="Watchers&#39;_Council" title="wikilink">Watchers' Council</a>, whose job is to train the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offering insights into their origins and advice on how to kill them.</p>
<p>Buffy is also helped by friends she meets at <a href="Sunnydale_High" title="wikilink">Sunnydale High</a>: <a href="Willow_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Willow Rosenberg</a> (<a href="Alyson_Hannigan" title="wikilink">Alyson Hannigan</a>) and <a href="Xander_Harris" title="wikilink">Xander Harris</a> (<a href="Nicholas_Brendon" title="wikilink">Nicholas Brendon</a>). Willow is originally a bookish wallflower; she provides a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality, but shares the social isolation Buffy suffers after becoming a Slayer. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character, a powerful witch, and a lesbian. In contrast Xander, with no supernatural skills, provides comic relief and a grounded perspective. (Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in <a href="Conversations_with_Dead_People_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">only one</a>.)</p>

<p>The cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, <a href="Joyce_Summers" title="wikilink">Joyce Summers</a> (portrayed by <a href="Kristine_Sutherland" title="wikilink">Kristine Sutherland</a>) who functions as an anchor of normality in the Scoobies' lives, even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (&quot;<a href="Becoming,_Part_Two_(Buffy_episode)" title="wikilink">Becoming II</a>&quot;). Buffy's teenage sister <a href="Dawn_Summers" title="wikilink">Dawn Summers</a> (<a href="Michelle_Trachtenberg" title="wikilink">Michelle Trachtenberg</a>) does not appear until the fifth season.</p>
<p>The vampire <a href="Angel_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Angel</a> (portayed by <a href="David_Boreanaz" title="wikilink">David Boreanaz</a>) is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy to make amends for his sins and search for redemption in his own spin-off, <em><a href="Angel_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Angel</a></em>.</p>
<p>At Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students willing to join her fight for good (alongside her friends Willow and Xander). <a href="Cordelia_Chase" title="wikilink">Cordelia Chase</a> (<a href="Charisma_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Charisma Carpenter</a>), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved, and <a href="Daniel_&quot;Oz&quot;_Osbourne" title="wikilink">Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne</a> (<a href="Seth_Green" title="wikilink">Seth Green</a>), a part-time rock guitarist, joins the <a href="Scooby_Gang" title="wikilink">Scooby Gang</a> through his relationship with Willow. <a href="Anya_Jenkins" title="wikilink">Anya</a> (<a href="Emma_Caulfield" title="wikilink">Emma Caulfield</a>), a former <a href="vengeance_demon" title="wikilink">vengeance demon</a> (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers, and joins the <a href="Scooby_Gang" title="wikilink">Scooby Gang</a> in the fourth season.</p>
<p>In Buffy's senior year at school, she meets <a href="Faith_Lehane" title="wikilink">Faith</a> (<a href="Eliza_Dushku" title="wikilink">Eliza Dushku</a>), the second current-slayer who was brought forth when <a href="Kendra" title="wikilink">a previous slayer</a> was killed by <a href="Drusilla_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">a vampire</a>. Although she initially she fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the Scooby gang, she comes to stand against them after accidentally killing a human.</p>
<p>Buffy gathers other allies: <a href="Spike_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Spike</a> (<a href="James_Marsters" title="wikilink">James Marsters</a>), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. Spike is known for his <a href="Billy_Idol" title="wikilink">Billy Idol</a>-style <a href="Platinum_Blonde" title="wikilink">platinum blond</a> hair and his black leather duster, stolen from a <a href="Nikki_Wood" title="wikilink">previous Slayer</a>. <a href="Tara_Maclay" title="wikilink">Tara Maclay</a> (<a href="Amber_Benson" title="wikilink">Amber Benson</a>) is a fellow member of Willow's <a href="Wicca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wicca</a> group during the fourth season, and their friendship eventually turns into an ongoing love affair.

<p><em>Buffy</em> featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example the <a href="Big_and_little_bad" title="wikilink">Big Bad</a> characters were featured for at least one season (e.g., <a href="Glorificus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glorificus</a> was a character that appeared in 13 episodes, spanning much of Season 5).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Similarly, characters that allied themselves to the <a href="Scooby_Gang" title="wikilink">Scooby Gang</a> and characters which attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.</p>

<h3 id="angel"><em>Angel</em></h3>

<p>Buffy's perpetual love for the vampire-with-a-soul, <a href="Angel_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Angel</a>, played by <a href="David_Boreanaz" title="wikilink">David Boreanaz</a>, is a recurrent theme in the first three seasons of the show. The <a href="spin-off" class="uri" title="wikilink">spin-off</a> <em>Angel</em> was introduced in October, 1999, at the start of <em>Buffy</em>'s fourth season. The series was created by <em>Buffy</em>'s creator <a href="Joss_Whedon" title="wikilink">Whedon</a> in collaboration with <a href="David_Greenwalt" title="wikilink">David Greenwalt</a>. Like <em>Buffy</em>, it was produced by the production company, <a href="Mutant_Enemy" title="wikilink">Mutant Enemy</a>. At times, it performed better in the <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Ratings</a> than its parent series.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The series was given a darker tone focussing on the ongoing trials of <a href="Angel_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Angel</a> in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a <a href="private_detective" title="wikilink">private detective</a> in a fictionalized version of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a>, where he and his associates work to &quot;help the helpless&quot; and to restore the faith and &quot;save the souls&quot; of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with evil demons or demonically-allied humans (primarily the law firm <a href="Wolfram_and_Hart" title="wikilink">Wolfram and Hart</a>), Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In the fifth season, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.</p>
<p>In addition to Boreanaz, <em>Angel</em> inherited <em>Buffy</em> regulars <a href="Charisma_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Charisma Carpenter</a> (<a href="Cordelia_Chase" title="wikilink">Cordelia Chase</a>) and <a href="Alexis_Denisof" title="wikilink">Alexis Denisof</a> (<a href="Wesley_Wyndam-Price" title="wikilink">Wesley Wyndam-Price</a>), followed later by <a href="Mercedes_McNab" title="wikilink">Mercedes McNab</a> (<a href="Harmony_Kendall" title="wikilink">Harmony Kendall</a>) and <a href="James_Marsters" title="wikilink">James Marsters</a> (<a href="Spike_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Spike</a>).

Angel continued to appear occasionally on <em>Buffy</em>.</p>

<p>Outside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called &quot;Buffyverse <a href="Expanded_Universe" title="wikilink">Expanded Universe</a>&quot;. The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.</p>
<p>The <a href="Buffy_comics" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> comics</a> are published by <a href="Dark_Horse_Comics" title="wikilink">Dark Horse</a>, which has retained the right to produce from 1998 onwards.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for <a href="Dark_Horse_Comics" title="wikilink">Dark Horse Comics</a> entitled <em><a href="Fray" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fray</a></em>, about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of <em><a href="Tales_of_the_Vampires" title="wikilink">Tales of the Vampires</a></em> in 2004, <em>Dark Horse Comics</em> halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company has recently announced that Whedon will be producing another comic series with 20 issues beginning in March 2007, to pick up where the television show left off &lt;U+2014&gt; taking the place of an eighth canonical season.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Pocket_Books" title="wikilink">Pocket Books</a> hold the license to produce <a href="Buffy_novels" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> novels</a>. Since 1998, they have published more than 60 <em>Buffy</em> novels.

<p>Five official <a href="Buffy_video_games" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> video games</a> have been released on portable and home consoles.

<h3 id="undeveloped-spinoffs">Undeveloped spinoffs</h3>

<p>The popularity of <em>Buffy</em> and <em>Angel</em> has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional 'Buffyverse'. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be greenlighted. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: <a href="Buffy_the_Animated_Series" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy the Animated Series</em></a> and <a href="Undeveloped_Buffyverse_productions#Ripper" title="wikilink"><em>Ripper</em></a>. <em>Buffy the Animated Series</em> was a proposed animated TV show based on <em>Buffy</em>. Whedon and <a href="Jeph_Loeb" title="wikilink">Jeph Loeb</a> were to be Executive Producers for the show and most of the cast from <em>Buffy</em> were to return to voice their characters. 20th Century Fox showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three minute pilot was completed in 2004 but never picked up. Whedon revealed to <a href="Hollywood_Reporter" title="wikilink">Hollywood Reporter</a>: &quot;We just couldn't find a home for [it]. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff &lt;U+2014&gt; and nobody wanted it.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer <a href="Jane_Espenson" title="wikilink">Jane Espenson</a> has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Undeveloped_Buffyverse_productions#Ripper" title="wikilink"><em>Ripper</em></a> was originally a proposed <a href="television_program" title="wikilink">television show</a> based upon the character of <a href="Rupert_Giles" title="wikilink">Rupert Giles</a>. More recent information has suggested that if <em>Ripper</em> were ever made it would be a TV-movie or a DVD-movie.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="As_of_2006" title="wikilink">As of 2006</a>, there are still no concrete plans.</p>
<p>In 2003, a year after the first public discussions on <em>Buffy the Animated Series</em> and <em>Ripper</em>, <em>Buffy</em> was nearing its end. Espenson has said that during this time spin-offs were discussed, &quot;I think <a href="Marti_Noxon" title="wikilink">Marti</a> talked with <a href="Joss_Whedon" title="wikilink">Joss</a> about <em>Slayer School</em> and <a href="Tim_Minear" title="wikilink">Tim Minear</a> talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Espenson has revealed that <a href="Undeveloped_Buffyverse_productions#Slayer_School" title="wikilink"><em>Slayer School</em></a> might have used new slayers and potentially included <a href="Willow_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Willow Rosenberg</a>, but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse <a href="Undeveloped_Buffyverse_productions#Faith_the_Vampire_Slayer" title="wikilink">TV series based on Faith</a> and instead agreed to a deal to produce <em><a href="Tru_Calling" title="wikilink">Tru Calling</a></em>. Dushku explained to <em>IGN</em>: &quot;It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I wouldn't have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following [<em>Buffy</em>], I think that those would have been really big boots to fill.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: &quot;The show was basically going to be Faith meets Kung Fu. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of <em>Angel</em>, a <a href="Spike_(film)" title="wikilink">movie</a> about <a href="Spike_(Buffyverse)" title="wikilink">Spike</a> was proposed.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and <a href="Amy_Acker" title="wikilink">Amy Acker</a> and featured <a href="Alyson_Hannigan" title="wikilink">Alyson Hannigan</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Outside the 2006 Saturn Awards, Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cultural-impact">Cultural impact</h2>
<p><em>Buffy</em> has had a cultural impact on a number of mediums. It has impacted <a href="television_studies" title="wikilink">television studies</a>, fan-made films, it has been parodied and referenced, and has even influenced other television series.</p>
<h3 id="academia">Academia</h3>

<p>BtVS is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture as a subset of <a href="popular_culture_studies" title="wikilink">popular culture studies</a>.

<p>The popularity of <em>Buffy</em> has led to websites, online discussion forums, works of <a href="Buffyverse_(Fan_made_productions)#Fan_fiction_(literature)" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> fan fiction</a> and several unofficial fan-made productions. <a href="Buffyverse_(Fan_made_productions)#Fan_films" title="wikilink"><em>Buffy</em> fan films</a> have been created for distribution on the internet.

<h3 id="parodies">Parodies</h3>

<p>The show has been spoofed by several comedy sketch shows.
