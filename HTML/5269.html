Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080 people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000 people evacuate the <a href="Inner_Harbor" title="wikilink">Inner Harbor</a> of <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>, as well.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Some <a href="rainband" title="wikilink">rainbands</a> produced up to 70 mph gusts (113 km/h), and in some areas isolated streaks of damage were described as being caused by tornadoes. Rainfall varied between 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) across the area, resulting in the <a href="Potomac_River" title="wikilink">Potomac River</a> to exceed its banks. At <a href="Point_of_Rocks,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Point of Rocks</a>, the river crested at 23.12 feet (7 m), 7.12 feet (2.2 m) above <a href="flood_stage" title="wikilink">flood stage</a>. Moderate flooding occurred there, and minor flooding occurred in <a href="Paw_Paw,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Paw Paw, West Virginia</a> where the river crested at 2.91 feet (0.9 m). The flooding closed a portion of the <a href="Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal" title="wikilink">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The gusty winds from the passage of the hurricane resulted in windspread and extensive tree damage. Due to previous rainfall, moist grounds easily allowed for trees to be uprooted. Wind damage to structures was minor, however, with one house in <a href="Carroll_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Carroll County</a> being damaged when a tree fell on it. Trees fell onto cars, roads, homes, and power lines, leaving 358,000 without power after the storm. 600 traffic signals were without power in <a href="Montgomery_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Montgomery County</a>, and about 70 roads were closed due to fallen trees. Isabel destroyed 94 buildings and damaged 87, including 33 homes, six of which were severely impacted with one losing a portion of its roof. Fallen trees injured two in <a href="Frederick_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Frederick County</a>. In western Maryland, damage totaled $2.07 million (2003 USD, $2.27 million 2006 USD).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on <a href="Wisconsin_Avenue_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">Wisconsin Avenue</a> recorded a storm surge of 11.3 feet (3.4 m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25 feet (3.1 m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the <a href="1933_Chesapeake_Potomac_Hurricane" title="wikilink">1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
