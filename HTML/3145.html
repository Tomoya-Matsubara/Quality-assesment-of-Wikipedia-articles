<p>A stormy relationship with <a href="Al_Davis" title="wikilink">Al Davis</a> developed, stemming from a contract dispute where Davis referred to Allen as a cancer to the team.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He also missed most of the <a href="1989_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1989</a> season with a knee injury.

During halftime of the Raiders-Dolphins game on Monday Night Football, a taped interview with Al Michaels was broadcast with Allen stating that Davis &quot;told me he was going to get me.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen further stated &quot;I think he's (Davis) tried to ruin the latter part of my career, tried to devalue me. He's trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don't want me to play.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
