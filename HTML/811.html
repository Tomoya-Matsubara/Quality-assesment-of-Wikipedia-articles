<p><strong><em>The Garrick Gaieties</em></strong> is a revue with music by <a href="Richard_Rodgers" title="wikilink">Richard Rodgers</a> and lyrics by <a href="Lorenz_Hart" title="wikilink">Lorenz Hart</a>, first of a long line of musicals by this <a href="Rodgers_and_Hart" title="wikilink">songwriting team</a>. It was the first of four <em>Garrick Gaiety</em> revues, which were subsquently produced in 1926 and 1930. The show parodied current subjects, such as the New York subway system and the <a href="Theatre_Guild" title="wikilink">Theatre Guild</a> (producer of the show). The <em>Garrick Gaieties</em> is remembered as &quot;bringing Rodgers and Hart their first major recognition.&quot; Their major hit song &quot;<a href="Manhattan_(song)" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>&quot; was introduced in this revue.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The revue first opened on <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> at the Garrick Theatre on <a href="May_17" title="wikilink">May 17</a>, <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>, as a 2-performance benefit for the <a href="Theatre_Guild" title="wikilink">Theatre Guild</a>. The reviews were favorable, and Rodgers and others persuaded the Theatre Guild to continue the revue, which re-opened on June 8, 1925 and ran until November 28, for 211 performances.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Several writers contributed the material for the sketches, including Edith Meiser, <a href="Sam_Jaffe" title="wikilink">Sam Jaffe</a>, Benjamin Kaye and <a href="Morrie_Ryskind" title="wikilink">Morrie Ryskind</a>.</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="Philip_Loeb" title="wikilink">Philip Loeb</a> with musical staging by <a href="Herbert_Fields" title="wikilink">Herbert Fields</a>, the cast included <a href="Romney_Brent" title="wikilink">Romney Brent</a>, June Cochrane, <a href="Sterling_Holloway" title="wikilink">Sterling Holloway</a>, <a href="Libby_Holman" title="wikilink">Libby Holman</a>, Philip Loeb, Edith Meiser, <a href="Sanford_Meisner" title="wikilink">Sanford Meisner</a>, Betty Starbuck, and <a href="Lee_Strasberg" title="wikilink">Lee Strasberg</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sketches-and-musical-numbers">Sketches and musical numbers</h2>
<p>The opening number, &quot;Soliciting Subscriptions&quot; was a spoof of the Theatre Guild's &quot;serious pretensions&quot;, along with the following song, &quot;Gilding the Guild&quot;. Ryskind wrote skits including a satire of President and Mrs. <a href="Calvin_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Calvin Coolidge</a>, and a parody of the <a href="Scopes_Trial" title="wikilink">Scopes Trial</a>, which was dropped from the show after <a href="William_Jennings_Bryan" title="wikilink">William Jennings Bryan</a> died. Libby Holman's solo, &quot;Black and White&quot; was later dropped. Sterling Holloway and June Cochrane introduced the song &quot;Manhattan&quot;, as its &quot;easygoing strolling melody and ingeniously rhymed lyric related all of the everyday pleasures to be found in New York...&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
