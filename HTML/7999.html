<p><strong>Frederick Samuel Modise</strong> (1914 - 1998) was a <a href="South_African" title="wikilink">South African</a> church leader and founder of the International Pentecost Church (IPC).</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Modise was born and grew up in a village inhabited by the <a href="Tswana_people" title="wikilink">Tswana tribe</a>, near <a href="Hammanskraal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hammanskraal</a> in the Transvaal of <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. As an adult adult, Modise started his own businesses in the carpentry and funeral industries.</p>
<p>In middle age, Modise suffered a serious stomach ailment, his equipment was stolen, and he went bankrupt. Additionally, Modise's children died. Modise went to various prophets and healers within the Church without being healed. Afterwards, he turned to various seers and medicine men, with the same disappointing results.</p>
<p>In 1962, Modise was admitted to the Coronation Hospital in Johannesburg, where it was deemed his disease incurable. On September 12 to 14, he had every midnight an apparition in which a voice gave him the secret teaching of how he would &quot;be spiritually&quot; after confession. Rev. Frederick Modise was commanded to teach people in this b&lt;U+00F6&gt;nemetod, so that they could be heard. The third and last night he was told to leave his hospital bed, he would be well written on 3 October, come to form a large church. The voice identified itself as &quot;Jehovah your God.&quot; This happened on a Saturday, which, according to the divine to the speech would be celebrated as the Sabbath.</p>
<p>This was a turning point in Rev. Frederick Modise's life. He immediately began to teach the spiritual prayer as he had been taught and fifteen people at the hospital were healed by confession and prayer, before Rev. Frederick Modise, just as promised, had to leave the hospital on October 3.</p>

<p><a href="International_Pentecostal_Church" title="wikilink">International Pentecostal Church</a> (IPC) was founded in Meadowlands by Reverend Frederick Modise in 1964. This would mark the largest schism in the Zulu Christian Church since 1948.</p>
<p>He built a church and immediately began spreading the message and pray for the sick. Many were healed and joined Rev Frederick Modise's church which he initially called the International Pentecost Holiness Church. In 1970, he moved the church headquarters to Oskraal, outside <a href="Pretoria,_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a>. A large local church, called Jerusalem was built.</p>
<p>Rev. Frederick Modise's healing preaching produced great church growth and eventually grew also out of these premises. In May 1991, South African President <a href="De_Klerk" title="wikilink">FW de Klerk</a>, inaugurated the church's new headquarters, in Zuurbekom, west of Johannesburg.</p>
