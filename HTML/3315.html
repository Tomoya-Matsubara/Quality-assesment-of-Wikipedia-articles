Many of the details of her life are disputed, including her parentage. Although she is treated in the sagas as a historical person, even her historicity is a matter of some debate.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Gunnhild appears prominently in many <a href="Norse_sagas" title="wikilink">Norse sagas</a>, including <em><a href="Fagrskinna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fagrskinna</a></em>, <em><a href="Egil&#39;s_Saga" title="wikilink">Egil's Saga</a></em>, <em><a href="Njal&#39;s_Saga" title="wikilink">Njal's Saga</a></em>, and <em><a href="Heimskringla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heimskringla</a></em>. What details of her life are known come largely from <a href="Iceland" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a> sources, which generally asserted that the Icelandic settlers had fled from Harald's tyranny. While the historicity of such sources as the <em><a href="Landnamabok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Landnamabok</a></em> is disputed, the perception that Harald had exiled or driven out many of their ancestors led to an attitude among Icelanders generally hostile to Erik and Gunnhild. Scholars such as <a href="Gwyn_Jones_(author)" title="wikilink">Gwyn Jones</a> therefore regard some of the episodes reported in them as suspect.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The sagas relate that Gunnhild lived during a time of great change and upheaval in Norway. Her father-in-law <a href="Harald_I_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Harald Fairhair</a> had recently united much of Norway under his rule. Shortly after his death, Gunnhild and her husband were overthrown and exiled. She spent much of the rest of her life in exile in <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, <a href="Jorvik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jorvik</a> and <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>. A number of her many children with Erik became co-rulers of Norway in the late tenth century.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>According to the 12th century <a href="Historia_Norvegiae" title="wikilink">Historia Norvegiae</a>, Gunnhild was the daughter of <a href="Gorm_the_Old" title="wikilink">Gorm the Old</a>, king of <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>, and Erik and Gunnhild met at a feast given by Gorm. Modern scholars have largely accepted this version as accurate.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In their view, her marriage with Erik was a dynastic union between two houses, that of the Norwegian <a href="Ynglings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ynglings</a> and that of the early <a href="List_of_kings_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish monarchy</a> (who may have claimed descent from <a href="Ragnar_Lodbrok" title="wikilink">Ragnar Lodbrok</a>), in the process of unifying and consolidating their respective countries. Erik himself was the product of such a union between Harald and Ragnhild, a Danish princess from <a href="Jutland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jutland</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Gwyn Jones in particular supported the identification of Gunnhild as the daughter of Gorm, and regarded the stories of her origins in <a href="Halogaland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halogaland</a> in northern <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> and her tutelage by Finnish wizards as part of a general Icelandic hostility towards Gunnhild and Erik.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <img src="Shaman.jpg" title="fig:Copper carving (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a Saami shaman with his rune drum (meavrresg&lt;U+00E1&gt;rri)" alt="Copper carving (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a Saami shaman with his rune drum (meavrresg&lt;U+00E1&gt;rri)" /> <em>Heimskringla</em> and <em>Egil's Saga</em>, on the other hand, assert that Gunnhild was the daughter of <a href="Ozur_Toti" title="wikilink">Ozur Toti</a>, a <a href="hersir" class="uri" title="wikilink">hersir</a> from Halogaland.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Accounts of her early life vary between sources. <em>Egil's Saga</em> relates that &quot;Eirik fought a great battle on the <a href="Northern_Dvina" title="wikilink">Northern Dvina</a> in <a href="Bjarmaland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bjarmaland</a>, and was victorious as the poems about him record. On the same expedition he obtained Gunnhild, the daughter of Ozur Toti, and brought her home with him.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Gwyn Jones regarded many of the traditions that grew up around Gunnhild in the Icelandic sources as fictional.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, both <a href="Theodoricus_monachus" title="wikilink">Theodoricus monachus</a> and the <em><a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;grip_af_N&lt;U+00F3&gt;regskonungas&lt;U+00F6&gt;gum" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;grip af N&lt;U+00F3&gt;regskonungas&lt;U+00F6&gt;gum</a></em> report that when Gunnhild was at the court of <a href="Harald_Bluetooth" title="wikilink">Harald Bluetooth</a> after Erik's death, the Danish king offered marriage to her; if valid, these accounts call into question the identification of Gunnhild as Harald's sister, but their most recent editors follow Jones in viewing their accounts of Gunnhild's origins as unreliable.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Heimskringla</em> relates that Gunnhild lived for a time in a hut with two <a href="Saami" title="wikilink">Finnish</a> wizards and learned <a href="seithr" title="wikilink">magic</a> from them. The two wizards demanded sexual favors from her, so she induced Erik, who was returning from an expedition to <a href="Bjarmland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bjarmland</a>, to kill them. Erik then took her to her father's house and announced his intent to marry Gunnhild.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The older <em>Fagrskinna</em>, however, says simply that Erik met Gunnhild during an expedition to the <a href="Finnish_people" title="wikilink">Finnish</a> north, where she was being &quot;fostered and educated ... with M&lt;U+01EB&gt;ttull, king of the <a href="Saami" title="wikilink">Finns</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Gunnhild's Finnish sojourn is described by historian Marlene Ciklamini as a &quot;fable&quot; designed to set the stage for placing the blame for Erik's future misrule on his wife.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Gunnhild and Erik are said to have had the following children: <a href="Gamle_Eriksson" title="wikilink">Gamle</a>, the oldest; then <a href="Guthorm_Eriksson" title="wikilink">Guthorm</a>, <a href="Harald_Greycloak" title="wikilink">Harald</a>, <a href="Ragnfrod_Eriksson" title="wikilink">Ragnfrod</a>, <a href="Ragnhild_Eriksdotter" title="wikilink">Ragnhild</a>, <a href="Erling_Eriksson" title="wikilink">Erling</a>, <a href="Gudrod_Eriksson" title="wikilink">Gudrod</a>, and <a href="Sigurd_Sleva" title="wikilink">Sigurd Sleva</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>Egil's Saga</em> mentions a son named R&lt;U+00F6&gt;gnvald, but it is not known whether he can be identified with one of those mentioned in <em>Heimskringla</em>, or even whether he was Gunnhild's son or Erik's by another woman.</p>
<p>Gunnhild was widely reputed to be a <em><a href="v&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva" class="uri" title="wikilink">v&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva</a></em>, or <a href="witch" class="uri" title="wikilink">witch</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Prior to the death of <a href="Harald_Fairhair" title="wikilink">Harald Fairhair</a>, Erik's popular half-brother <a href="Halfdan_Haraldsson_the_Black" title="wikilink">Halfdan Haraldsson the Black</a> died mysteriously, and Gunnhild was suspected of having &quot;bribed a witch to give him a <a href="poison" title="wikilink">death-drink</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Shortly thereafter, Harald died and Erik consolidated his power over the whole country. He began to quarrel with his other brothers, egged on by Gunnhild, and had four of them killed, beginning with <a href="Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn_Farmann" title="wikilink">Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn Farmann</a> and later <a href="Olaf_Haraldsson_Geirstadalf" title="wikilink">Olaf</a> and <a href="Sigr&lt;U+00F8&gt;d_Haraldsson" title="wikilink">Sigr&lt;U+00F8&gt;d</a> in battle at <a href="T&lt;U+00F8&gt;nsberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">T&lt;U+00F8&gt;nsberg</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result of Erik's tyrannical rule (which was likely greatly exaggerated in the sagas) he was expelled from Norway when the nobles of the country declared for his half-brother, <a href="Haakon_the_Good" title="wikilink">Haakon the Good</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="orkney-and-jorvik">Orkney and Jorvik</h3>
<p>According to the Icelandic sagas, Erik set sail with his family and his retainers to <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, where they settled for a number of years. During that time Erik was acknowledged as &quot;King of Orkney&quot; by its <em>de facto</em> rulers, the <a href="Earl" title="wikilink">jarls</a> <a href="Arnkel_Turf-Einarsson" title="wikilink">Arnkel</a> and <a href="Erlend_Turf-Einarsson" title="wikilink">Erlend Turf-Einarsson</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Gunnhild went with Erik to <a href="Jorvik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jorvik</a> when, at the invitation of <a href="Wulfstan_I,_Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Bishop Wulfstan</a>, the erstwhile Norwegian king settled as client king over northern <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> At Jorvik, both Erik and Gunnhild may have been baptized.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <img src="Haakon_den_godes_saga_-_Gunnhild_d&lt;U+00F8&gt;pes_-_C._Krohg.jpg" title="fig:Baptism of Gunnhild.

<p>Following Erik's loss of Jorvik and subsequent death at the <a href="Battle_of_Stainmore" title="wikilink">Battle of Stainmore</a> (954), the survivors of the battle brought word of the defeat to Gunnhild and her sons in <a href="Northumberland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumberland</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Taking with them all that they could, they set sail for Orkney, where they exacted tribute from the new jarl, <a href="Thorfinn_Skullsplitter" title="wikilink">Thorfinn Skullsplitter</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Gunnhild decided to move on; marrying her daughter Ragnhild to Jarl Thorfinn's son <a href="Arnfinn_Thorfinnsson" title="wikilink">Arnfinn</a>, she took her other children and set sail for Denmark.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that some modern historians call into question the identification of the Erik who ruled over Jorvik with Erik Bloodaxe. None of the English sources for Erik's reign in <a href="Northumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumbria</a> identify him as Norwegian or as the son of Harald Fairhair. A thirteenth-century letter from <a href="Edward_I" title="wikilink">Edward I</a> to <a href="Pope_Boniface_VIII" title="wikilink">Pope Boniface VIII</a> identifies Erik as <a href="Scottish_people" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> in origin.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Lappenberg, Plummer and Todd, writing in the late nineteenth century, identified Erik as a son of <a href="Harald_Bluetooth" title="wikilink">Harald Bluetooth</a>, a claim Downham discounts as untenable.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Downham, however, regards Erik the king of Jorvik as a distinct individual from Erik Bloodaxe, and thus views Gunnhild's sojourn in Orkney and Jorvik as the construct of later saga-writers who conflated different characters between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="conflict-with-egil-skallagrimsson">Conflict with Egil Skallagrimsson</h3>
<p>Gunnhild was the nemesis of <a href="Egil_Skallagrimsson" title="wikilink">Egil Skallagrimsson</a>, and his saga and poetry present her in a particularly negative light. Egil was introduced to Erik by his older brother <a href="Thorolf_Skallagrimsson" title="wikilink">Thorolf</a>, who was a friend of the prince, and the brothers were originally on good terms with Erik and Gunnhild.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> However, during a sojourn in Norway around 930, Egil got into an inheritance dispute with certain members of Erik's court, during which he killed B&lt;U+00E1&gt;r&lt;U+00F0&gt;r of Atley, one of the king's retainers.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Gunnhild ordered her two brothers to kill Egil and Thorolf. Egil killed the pair when they confronted him, greatly increasing the Queen's thirst for revenge.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="Egil_Skallagrimsson_17c_manuscript.jpg" title="fig:Picture of Egil in a 17th century manuscript of Egils Saga." alt="Picture of Egil in a 17th century manuscript of Egils Saga." /></p>
<p>Erik then declared Egil an outlaw in Norway. Berg-&lt;U+00D6&gt;nundr gathered a company of men to capture Egil, but was killed in his attempt to do so.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> During his escape from Norway, Egil killed <a href="R&lt;U+00F6&gt;gnvald_Eriksson" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00F6&gt;gnvald Eriksson</a>, Erik's son.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He then cursed Erik and Gunnhild by setting a horse's head on a pole in a shamanic ritual (the pillar was a <em>n&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;st&lt;U+00F6&gt;ng</em> or &quot;<a href="Ni&lt;U+00F0&gt;ing_Pole" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;-pole</a>&quot;; n&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt; translates, roughly, to 'scorn' or 'curse'.) and saying:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The last encounter between Egil and Gunnhild occurred around 948 in Jorvik. Egil was shipwrecked on a nearby shore and came before Erik, who sentenced him to death. But Egil composed a <em><a href="dr&lt;U+00E1&gt;pa" class="uri" title="wikilink">dr&lt;U+00E1&gt;pa</a></em> called &quot;<a href="H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fu&lt;U+00F0&gt;lausn" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fu&lt;U+00F0&gt;lausn</a>&quot; in Erik's praise over a single night.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> When he recited it in the morning, Erik gave him his freedom and forgave the killing of R&lt;U+00F6&gt;gnvald, against Gunnhild's wishes.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>She helped Hrut take possession of an inheritance by arranging the death of a man named Soti at the hands of her servant, <a href="Augmund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augmund</a> and her son Gudrod.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> When Hrut returned home, Gunnhild gave him many presents, but she cursed Hrut with <a href="priapism" class="uri" title="wikilink">priapism</a> to ruin his marriage to Unn, daughter of <a href="Mord_Fiddle" title="wikilink">Mord Fiddle</a>; the two ultimately divorced.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Gunnhild also showed great favor to <a href="Olaf_the_Peacock" title="wikilink">Olaf the Peacock</a>, Hrut's nephew, who visited the Norwegian court after Hrut's return to Norway.

<p><a href="Haakon_Sigurdsson" title="wikilink">Haakon Sigurdsson</a>, <a href="Trondejarls" title="wikilink">jarl of Hla&lt;U+00F0&gt;ir</a>, arranged the death of Harald Greyhide around 971 with the connivance of Harald Bluetooth, who had invited his foster-son to Denmark to be invested with new Danish <a href="fief" title="wikilink">fiefs</a>. Civil war broke out between Jarl Haakon and the surviving sons of Erik and Gunnhild, but Haakon proved victorious and Gunnhild had to flee Norway once again, with her remaining sons Gudrod and Ragnfred.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> They went to Orkney, again imposing themselves as overlords over Jarl Thorfinn.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> However, it appears that Gunnhild was less interested in ruling the country than in having a place to live quietly, and her sons used the islands as a base for abortive raids on Haakon's interests; the government of Orkney was therefore firmly in the hands of Thorfinn.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <img src="Haraldskaerwoman.jpg" title="fig:Haraldsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r Woman in a glass covered coffin, Vejle, Denmark" alt="Haraldsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r Woman in a glass covered coffin, Vejle, Denmark" /> According to the <em><a href="Jomsvikinga_Saga" title="wikilink">Jomsvikinga Saga</a></em>, Gunnhild returned to Denmark around 977 but was killed at the orders of King Harald by being drowned in a bog. The <em>&lt;U+00C1&gt;grip</em> and Theodoricus Monachus's <em>Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium</em> contain versions of this account.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> <img src="Olav_Tryggvasons_saga-Gunnhild-C._Krohg.jpg" title="fig:Gunnhild as an old woman.

<p>In 1835, the body of a murdered or ritually <a href="human_sacrifice" title="wikilink">sacrificed</a> woman, the so-called <a href="Haraldsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r_Woman" title="wikilink">Haraldsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r Woman</a>, was unearthed in a bog in <a href="Jutland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jutland</a>. Because of the account of Gunnhild's murder contained in the <em>Jomsviking Saga</em> and other sources, the body was mistakenly identified as that of Gunnhild. Based upon the belief of her royal personage, King <a href="Frederick_VI_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick VI of Denmark</a> commanded an elaborate <a href="sarcophagus" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarcophagus</a> be <a href="wood_carving" title="wikilink">carved</a> to hold her body. This royal treatment of Haraldsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r Woman&lt;U+2019&gt;s remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, <a href="Tollund_Man" title="wikilink">Tollund Man</a>, a later discovery, was not properly conserved and most of the body has been lost, leaving only the head as original material in his display. Later <a href="radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">radiocarbon dating</a> demonstrated that the Harakdsk&lt;U+00E6&gt;r Woman was not Gunnhild, but rather a woman who lived in the 6th century BCE.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
