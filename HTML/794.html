<p>The statue was originally located close to the junction of Park Drive and Rink Street, next to <a href="St_George&#39;s_Park,_Port_Elizabeth" title="wikilink">St George's Park</a>, but was moved to its present position in Cape Road in the 1950s.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

The design as a whole is an object lesson in kindness, and may appeal to the cruel or careless driver, and teach him that there are some who do not think it beneath them to attend to the wants of animals placed under their charge.</p>
