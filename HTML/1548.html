<p><strong>Vincent Paul Young, Jr.</strong>, commonly <strong>Vince Young</strong> or &quot;<strong>VY</strong>&quot;, born <a href="May_18" title="wikilink">May 18</a>, <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> in <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a>, is an <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> player. He is currently a <a href="quarterback#Dual_threat_quarterbacks" title="wikilink">dual-threat</a> <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> for the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a>, having been selected by the Titans as the #3 overall pick in the <a href="NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">NFL Draft</a> on <a href="April_29" title="wikilink">April 29</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.</p>
<p>Previously he played <a href="college_football" title="wikilink">college football</a> for the <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas</a> (UT) <a href="Texas_Longhorn_Athletics" title="wikilink">Longhorns</a> before turning professional. He is remembered in Longhorns lore for bringing the school its <a href="2005_Texas_Longhorn_football_team" title="wikilink">fourth national championship in football</a> and the first since <a href="1970_in_sports" title="wikilink">1970</a>.</p>
<p>As a college junior, he was one of three finalists for the 2005 <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a>, finishing second to <a href="Reggie_Bush" title="wikilink">Reggie Bush</a> in the final vote. Young has been named the best college football player of 2005 by <a href="College_Football_News" title="wikilink">College Football News</a>, based upon their statistical analysis.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Young led his team to a victory in the <a href="BCS_National_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">BCS National Championship Game</a> on <a href="January_4" title="wikilink">January 4</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, in a classic thriller against the defending BCS national champion <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">University of Southern California</a> <a href="USC_Athletics" title="wikilink">Trojans</a> in the <a href="Rose_Bowl_Game" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl Game</a> to capture the national championship.</p>
<p>On <a href="January_8" title="wikilink">January 8</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Young declared he would forego his last year of <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> college eligibility and become a professional player by entering the <a href="2006_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2006 NFL Draft</a>. This decision made him the second player in <a href="Mack_Brown" title="wikilink">Mack Brown</a>'s eight year term as head coach of the Texas Longhorns to enter the NFL with eligibility remaining.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="January_10" title="wikilink">January 10</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> was proclaimed &quot;Vince Young Day&quot; in his home town of Houston, Texas.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> After declaring for the draft, Young was the subject of much speculation about how high he might be drafted.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>Young grew up in <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a> where he was primarily raised by his mother and his grandmother. His father, Vincent Young Sr., is currently in prison for a 2003 <a href="burglary" class="uri" title="wikilink">burglary</a> conviction.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Young credits his mother and grandmother for keeping him away from the street gangs with which he was briefly involved in his early <a href="adolescence" class="uri" title="wikilink">adolescence</a>. At the age of 7, Young was struck by a vehicle while riding his <a href="bicycle" class="uri" title="wikilink">bicycle</a> at the corner of Tidewater and Buxley streets in his Houston neighborhood. The accident nearly killed him, leaving him hospitalized for months after the bicycle's handle bar went into his stomach. Today, he credits this event for making him into a &quot;tougher&quot; individual.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="high-school-career">High school career</h2>
<p>Young was coached by Ray Seals at <a href="Madison_High_School_(Houston)" title="wikilink">Madison High School</a> in Houston, Texas where he <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#S" title="wikilink">started</a> at quarterback (QB) for three years and compiled 7,624 yards of <a href="American_football#Advancing_the_ball" title="wikilink">total offense</a> during his career.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> During his senior season he led his Marlins past the previously undefeated North Shore Mustangs, in a game that would go down in Texas football history as one of the greatest ever played.</p>
<p>Among the honors he received:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Parade_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Parade</a></em>'s and <em>Student Sports</em>' National Player of the Year after compiling 3,819 yards and 59 <a href="touchdowns" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a> (TD) as a senior<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>

</ul>
<p>He was also a varsity athlete in numerous other sports. In <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> he played as a guard/forward and averaged more than 20 points per game over his career. This allowed him to be a four-year <a href="Letterman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Letterman</a> and two-time <a href="All-star#Variations" title="wikilink">all-district</a> performer. In <a href="track_and_field" title="wikilink">track and field</a> he was a three-year Letterman and member of two district champion 400-meter relay squads. In <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> he played for two seasons, spending time as both an outfielder and pitcher. He also made the <a href="All-star#Variations" title="wikilink">all-state</a> team in football and in track. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Young <a href="National_Signing_Day" title="wikilink">signed</a> with Texas in 2002 and <a href="redshirt_(college_sports)" title="wikilink">redshirted</a> rather than playing his first year. This means that he participated in drills and practices, but did not play in any games. This allowed him a full year to learn the playbook and to develop his skills before being asked to play in a game situation. A redshirt season is not counted by the NCAA as one of the four years of his college eligibility, meaning he could still elect to play for the team for up to four seasons after the redshirt year.</p>
<p>As a redshirt <a href="freshman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freshman</a> (as opposed to a true freshman who has not sat out a redshirt year) in 2003, Young played in 12 games, including seven as the Longhorns' <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#S" title="wikilink">starter</a>. He had a 6-1 record (6 wins and one loss) in the seven games where he started the game as quarterback.</p>
<p>As a redshirt <a href="sophomore" class="uri" title="wikilink">sophomore</a> in the <a href="2004_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">2004 season</a>, Young started every game and led the Longhorns to a 11-1 season record, a top 5 final ranking, and the school's first-ever appearance and victory in the <a href="Rose_Bowl_Game" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl</a> against the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>. He solidified his reputation as a <a href="Quarterback#Dual_threat_quarterbacks" title="wikilink">dual-threat</a> quarterback who can advance the ball well either by <a href="American_football#Advancing_the_ball" title="wikilink">passing or rushing</a>. This was further solidified by the fact that Texas revamped its offense from a base I-formation to a shotgun 3 wide receiver set to better fit his unique skills. This makes it more difficult for the <a href="defensive_team" title="wikilink">defensive team</a> to account for all possible <a href="Play_from_scrimmage" title="wikilink">plays from scrimmage</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="2005_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">2005 regular season</a>, Young led the Longhorns to an 11-0 regular season record. The Longhorns held a #2 ranking in the preseason, and held that ranking through the season except for one week when they were ranked #1 in the <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Texas then won the <a href="Big_12_Conference" title="wikilink">Big 12</a> championship game and still held their #2 BCS ranking, which earned them a berth in the National Championship Rose Bowl game against the USC Trojans. Before the game, the USC Trojans were being discussed on <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a> and other media outlets as possibly the greatest college football team of all time. Riding a 34 game winning streak, including the previous National Championship, USC featured two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield, including quarterback <a href="Matt_Leinart" title="wikilink">Matt Leinart</a> (2004 Heisman winner) and running back <a href="Reggie_Bush" title="wikilink">Reggie Bush</a> (2005 Heisman winner) who was widely discussed as being possibly the best running back in the history of college football.</p>
<p>In the Rose Bowl, Vince Young put on one of the most dominating individual performances in college football history, accounting for 467 yards of total offense (200 <a href="Rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing</a>, 267 <a href="Forward_pass" title="wikilink">passing</a>) and three rushing <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a> (including a 9 yard TD scramble with 19 seconds left) to lead the Longhorns to a thrilling 41-38 victory. This performance led to him winning Rose Bowl MVP honors for the second consecutive season. After the game, former USC and NFL safety <a href="Ronnie_Lott" title="wikilink">Ronnie Lott</a> said &quot;Vince Young is the greatest quarterback to ever play college football.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> &quot;Without question,&quot; said Trojans coach Pete Carroll, &quot;that was the best [performance] I've seen by one guy.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Early in his collegiate career, Vince Young had been criticized as &quot;great rusher...average passer&quot;, and his unconventional throwing motion had been criticised as being &quot;side-arm&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> as opposed to the conventional &quot;over the top&quot; throwing motion typically used by college quarterbacks. However, by the 2005 season most of the criticism had faded, and he developed into a consistent and precise passer. Young concluded the 2005 regular season as the #1 rated passer in the nation. Including the Big 12 Championship game and the Rose Bowl, he finished as the #3 rated passer in the nation, with a <a href="Passer_rating" title="wikilink">quarterback rating</a> of 163.9. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

The issue was on sale nationwide alongside the regular edition of the magazine, which also featured the Rose Bowl on the cover.</p>
<h2 id="nfl-draft">NFL Draft</h2>
<p>Throughout the 2005 season Young had indicated that he planned to return to the University of Texas for his senior year in 2006<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>. The day after Texas won the BCS National Championship, Young accepted an invitation to appear on <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show</a></em> with <a href="Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">Jay Leno</a>. When Leno asked Young whether he would stay for his senior year of college or declare for the 2006 NFL Draft, Young replied that he would discuss the matter with his pastor, his family and coach Mack Brown. On <a href="January_8" title="wikilink">January 8</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Young announced he would enter the NFL draft, where he was expected to be drafted early in the first round.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. Even after his Rose Bowl performance, some observers said he may have difficulty in the NFL because of his unorthodox sidearm throwing motion and the different style of play in the NFL.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Before <a href="Drew_Brees" title="wikilink">Drew Brees</a> signed as a <a href="free_agent" title="wikilink">free agent</a> with the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>, Young was predicted by most experts to be the third overall pick in the draft belonging to the <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a>, where he would reunite with his close friend and mentor <a href="Steve_McNair" title="wikilink">Steve McNair</a>. However, with the Saints (who had the second overall pick) likely to pass on taking a high-rated quarterback, Young was no longer thought to be a consensus top five pick. Some had speculated that he would not even be picked in the top ten.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>A controversy regarding the Wonderlic, a standardized test given to all recruits, was thought also to have been problematic for Young. On <a href="February_25" title="wikilink">February 25</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, during the <a href="NFL_Combine" title="wikilink">NFL Combine</a>, a rumor surfaced that he scored a six, out of a possible fifty points, on his <a href="Wonderlic_Test" title="wikilink">Wonderlic Test</a>. The test is designed to measure cognitive ability, which could indicate a player's ability to learn a complex NFL playbook. The Wonderlic corporation has resisted equating a score with a given I.Q. Charlie Wonderlic Jr., president of Wonderlic Inc., says, &quot;A score of 10 is literacy, that's about all we can say.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Some observers believed this score would lower Young's draft selection and faulted his agent, <a href="Major_Adams" title="wikilink">Major Adams</a>, for not preparing Young ahead of time with practice tests.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>However, on <a href="February_26" title="wikilink">February 26</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> combine officials said the reported score of six was incorrect. According to NFL Spokesman Steve Alic, &quot;I can tell you absolutely that the score that has been reported on the Internet is inaccurate. I spoke to the person who graded the test, and he assured me that that number was not correct.&quot; <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The next day, the test was properly readministered and Young scored a sixteen, according to his agent Major Adams<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Wonderlic scores are released to NFL teams for draft purposes, but are not supposed to be released publicly.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> While there has been a media buzz over Young's score, all in all the specifics of what exactly occurred to render the first test results invalid is not known. Still, some in the NFL dispute whether the Wonderlic scores are meaningful at predicting a recruit's playing ability. Sean Jones, a member of the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a>' personnel department, said:</p>
<dl>

<dd>All I need to know about Vince Young is that he came up with one of the greatest performances ever in the Rose Bowl. In the fourth quarter, I saw (USC coach) Pete Carroll throw every kind of blitz at Vince. I saw Vince read the blitz and beat the blitz. I don't care what his Wonderlic score is. The only score I care about is 41-38.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>

<p>The NFL draft was held on April 29-30, 2006. The <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a> drafted Vince Young with their first round pick (3rd choice overall), confirming the predictions of many draft experts. The Titans general manager, Floyd Reese, said Young's upside was the deciding factor in his being chosen. Reese said, &quot;Last night at 11:35, I was on my knees praying ... he will rewrite the position. This guy physically is such a combination of arms and legs. People want to make him out to be a <a href="Michael_Vick" title="wikilink">Michael Vick</a>. He's not that.
