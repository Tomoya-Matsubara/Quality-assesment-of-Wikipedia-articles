Led by expedition commander <a href="Douglas_Mawson" title="wikilink">Douglas Mawson</a>, the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in <a href="Ad&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie_Land" title="wikilink">Ad&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie Land</a>, pushing about  towards <a href="Victoria_Land" title="wikilink">Victoria Land</a>. Accompanying Mawson were <a href="Belgrave_Edward_Sutton_Ninnis" title="wikilink">Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis</a>, a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal_Fusiliers" title="wikilink">Royal Fusiliers</a>, and the Swiss ski expert <a href="Xavier_Mertz" title="wikilink">Xavier Mertz</a>; the party used <a href="sledge_dog" title="wikilink">sledge dogs</a> to increase their speed across the ice. Initially they made good progress, crossing two huge glaciers on their route south-east.</p>
<p>On 14 December 1912, with the party more than  from the safety of the main base at <a href="Cape_Denison" title="wikilink">Cape Denison</a>, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a <a href="crevasse" class="uri" title="wikilink">crevasse</a> and were lost. Their supplies now severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, gradually using the remaining sledge dogs to supplement their scarce rations. As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick, making progress difficult. After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone. For almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic, crossing the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave&lt;U+2014&gt;a food depot  from the main base&lt;U+2014&gt;on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a <a href="blizzard" class="uri" title="wikilink">blizzard</a> raged outside. As a result he missed the ship back to Australia; the <a href="SY_Aurora" title="wikilink">SY <em>Aurora</em></a> had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting for more than three weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the <em>Aurora</em> returned in December 1913.</p>
<p>The causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study suggested <a href="hypervitaminosis_A" title="wikilink">hypervitaminosis A</a>, presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their <a href="Greenland_Dog" title="wikilink">Greenland Huskies</a>, which are now known to be unusually high in <a href="vitamin_A" title="wikilink">vitamin A</a>. While this is considered the most likely theory, dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses. In 1976 explorer and mountaineer <a href="Edmund_Hillary" title="wikilink">Sir Edmund Hillary</a> described Mawson's month-long journey as &quot;probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Over the next several days, the party continued across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole (the lid), and once across the first of the two dog teams would follow. Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow, &quot;otherwise&quot;, wrote Mawson, &quot;the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> After Mawson slipped into a crevasse, they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Ninnis developed <a href="photokeratitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">photokeratitis</a> (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with <a href="zinc_sulfate" title="wikilink">zinc sulfate</a> and <a href="cocaine_hydrochloride" title="wikilink">cocaine hydrochloride</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> On 24 November, the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>On level ground again, they began to make quick progress. They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the <a href="Ninnis_Glacier" title="wikilink">Ninnis Glacier</a>) far larger than the first.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In the harsh conditions, the dogs began to grow restless; one of them, Shackleton, tore open the men's food bag and devoured a  pack of butter, crucial for their nourishment to supplement the <a href="hoosh" class="uri" title="wikilink">hoosh</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> On 30 November, the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond, only to find themselves confronted at the top by sastrugi so sharp-edged the dogs were useless.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Worse still, temperatures rose to , melting the snow and making pulling difficult; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

After he died, Mawson tore the remaining blank pages from the diary to save weight.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>They made  on 31 December, no progress for the following two days, and 5 miles more on 3 January. &quot;[The] cold wind frost-bit Mertz's fingers&quot; recorded Mawson, &quot;and he is generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc&lt;U+2014&gt;so had to camp though going was good.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Not until 6 January did they make any more progress; they went  before Mertz collapsed.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued, but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz's condition again deteriorated. Mawson recorded:</p>

<p>Strong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess <a href="kerosene" class="uri" title="wikilink">kerosene</a> for the stove, he boiled the remainder of the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

Applying <a href="lanolin" class="uri" title="wikilink">lanolin</a> to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> &quot;My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment&quot; he recorded, &quot;frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body&quot;.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Averaging around 5 miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>To save himself from future crevasses, Mawson constructed a rope ladder, which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5 miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about  to his right. In it he found food and a note from <a href="Archibald_Lang_McLean" title="wikilink">Archibald Lang McLean</a>, who along with <a href="Frank_Hurley" title="wikilink">Frank Hurley</a> and <a href="Alfred_Hodgeman" title="wikilink">Alfred Hodgeman</a> had been sent out by <em>Aurora</em>'s captain <a href="John_King_Davis" title="wikilink">John King Davis</a> to search for the Far Eastern Party.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> From the note, Mawson learned he was  south-east of Aladdin's Cave, and near two further food depots.

<p>Although supplies had been left in Aladdin's Cave&lt;U+2014&gt;including fresh fruit&lt;U+2014&gt;there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent.

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p><img src="Douglas_Mawson_recuperating.jpg" title="fig:Mawson shortly after his return to Cape Denison" alt="Mawson shortly after his return to Cape Denison" /> The <em>Aurora</em> arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February&lt;U+2014&gt;just hours before Mawson's return to the hut&lt;U+2014&gt;the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the <em>Aurora</em> was recalled by <a href="wireless" class="uri" title="wikilink">wireless</a> radio, but a powerful blizzard sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship from returning to collect the men.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The <em>Aurora</em> returned to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, to take the men home.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told <a href="Phillip_Law" title="wikilink">Phillip Law</a>, then-director of <a href="Australian_National_Antarctic_Research_Expeditions" title="wikilink">Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions</a> (ANARE), that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>The cause of Mawson and Mertz's illnesses remains in part a mystery. At the time, McLean&lt;U+2014&gt;the expedition's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison&lt;U+2014&gt;attributed their sickness to <a href="colitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">colitis</a>; Mawson wrote in <em>The Home of the Blizzard</em>, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> A 1969 study by <a href="John_Burton_Cleland" title="wikilink">Sir John Cleland</a> and R.

This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> While hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz's death and Mawson's illness, the theory has its detractors.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Law believed it was &quot;completely unproven ...

<p>Suggestions of <a href="cannibalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cannibalism</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;that Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death&lt;U+2014&gt;surfaced during Mawson's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them &quot;outrageous&quot; and an &quot;invention&quot;.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; <a href="Beau_Riffenburgh" title="wikilink">Beau Riffenburgh</a> notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Law, who knew Mawson well, believed &quot;He was a man of very solid, conservative morals.

<p>In November 1913, shortly before the <em>Aurora</em> arrived to return them to Australia, the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The two glaciers the Far Eastern Party crossed&lt;U+2014&gt;previously unnamed&lt;U+2014&gt;were named by Mawson for Mertz and Ninnis.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> At a celebration in the centre of Adelaide on his return from Antarctica, Mawson praised his dead companions: &quot;The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all&quot;.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
