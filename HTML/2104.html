<p><strong>Zoological conspiracy theories involving Israel</strong> are occasionally found in the media or on the internet, typically in Muslim majority countries, alleging use of animals by <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> to attack civilians or to conduct <a href="espionage" class="uri" title="wikilink">espionage</a>. These conspiracies are often reported as evidence of a <a href="Zionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zionist</a> or Israeli plot.</p>
<p>Examples include the <a href="2010_Sharm_el-Sheikh_shark_attacks" title="wikilink">December 2010 shark attacks in Egypt</a> and the 2011 capture in <a href="Saudi_Arabia" title="wikilink">Saudi Arabia</a> of a <a href="Griffon_Vulture" title="wikilink">Griffon Vulture</a> carrying an Israeli-labeled <a href="GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="wikilink">satellite tracking device</a>.</p>

<p>In December 2010, several shark attacks occurred off the South Sinai resort of <a href="Sharm_el-Sheikh" title="wikilink">Sharm el-Sheikh</a> in Egypt.</p>
<p>Following the attacks, in an interview on <a href="Tawfik_Okasha" title="wikilink">Tawfik Okasha</a>'s popular but controversial <em><a href="Egypt_Today" title="wikilink">Egypt Today</a></em> TV show, a Captain <a href="Mustafa_Ismail" title="wikilink">Mustafa Ismail</a>, introduced as &quot;a famous diver&quot;, alleged that the <a href="GPS_tracking_unit" title="wikilink">GPS tracking device</a> found on one of the sharks was in fact a &quot;guiding device&quot; planted by Israeli agents.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Prompted in a TV interview for comments, the governor of <a href="South_Sinai_Governorate" title="wikilink">South Sinai</a>, Mohammad Abdul Fadhil Shousha initially said: &quot;What is being said about the Mossad throwing the deadly shark [in the sea] to hit tourism in Egypt is not out of the question. But it needs time to confirm.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shousha later directly dismissed the event as being connected to Israel.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Describing the conspiracy connection to Israel as &quot;sad&quot;, Professor Mahmoud Hanafy, a marine biologist at <a href="Suez_Canal_University" title="wikilink">Suez Canal University</a>, pointed out that GPS devices are used by marine biologists to track sharks, not to remote-control them.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Egyptian officials suggested that the attacks were due to overfishing, illegal feeding, the dumping overboard of sheep carcasses, or unusually high water temperatures.</p>
<p>Amr Yossef, Adjunct Professor of Political Science at the <a href="American_University_in_Cairo" title="wikilink">American University in Cairo</a>, wrote that this and other similar conspiracy theories result from a misconception among the Egyptian public that Israel is all-powerful. Yossef wrote, &quot;Notwithstanding that such allegations have no factual or logical grounds, no one stops to ask why should an Israel facing serious security challenges (Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc.) busy itself with that kind of stuff&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="birds-carrying-israeli-tracking-devices-and-tags">Birds carrying Israeli tracking devices and tags</h2>
<p>Birds (as well as other animals) are often tagged with <a href="GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="wikilink">GPS tracking devices</a> or identification bands to record their movements for <a href="animal_migration_tracking" title="wikilink">animal migration tracking</a> and similar reasons.</p>
<p>Ohad Hatzofe, an avian ecologist for the <a href="Israel_Nature_and_Parks_Authority" title="wikilink">Israel's Nature and Parks Authority</a>, said the idea that tagged birds are used for spying is absurd, and stated that &quot;Birds and other wildlife belongs to all of us and we have to cooperate... Ignorance causes these stupid beliefs that they are used for spying&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Gyps_fulvus_-Oakland_Zoo-8a.jpg" title="fig:A griffon vulture similar to the one captured in 2011." alt="A griffon vulture similar to the one captured in 2011." /> The <a href="Griffon_Vulture" title="wikilink">Griffon Vulture</a> has been nearly extinct from the mountains of Israel and is the subject of a <a href="reintroduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">reintroduction</a> project. As part of that project, vultures are tracked to keep track of the population.</p>
<p>In 2011, a griffon vulture with a wingspan of about  was caught by a hunter near <a href="Ha&#39;il" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ha'il</a>, <a href="Saudi_Arabia" title="wikilink">Saudi Arabia</a> wearing a GPS device and a &quot;<a href="Tel_Aviv_University" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv University</a>&quot; leg tag. Rumors spread among locals, repeated in some Saudi newspapers, that the bird was sent by Israel to spy on the country.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Prince <a href="Bandar_bin_Sultan" title="wikilink">Bandar bin Sultan</a>, then Secretary General of the <a href="Saudi_National_Security_Council" title="wikilink">Saudi National Security Council</a> dismissed the rumors, said the equipment on the bird was simply there for scientific study, and that the bird would be quickly released. Saudi wildlife authorities agreed that the equipment was for solely scientific purposes. &quot;Some Saudi journalists rushed in carrying the news of this bird for the sake of getting a scoop without checking the information... they should have asked the competent authorities about the bird before publishing such news,&quot; Bandar said at the time.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Israeli officials described the rumor as &quot;ludicrous&quot; and said they were &quot;stunned.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>A spokesman for Israel's Park and Nature Authority told the Israeli daily <em><a href="Ma&#39;ariv" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ma'ariv</a></em> that Israeli scientists use GPS devices to track <a href="Bird_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> routes. &quot;The device does nothing more than receive and store basic data about the bird's whereabouts,&quot; he said.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The Israeli ornithologist Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University said that this was the third such detention of a bird tracked by Israeli scientists in 3 decades. He reported that Sudanese authorities detained an <a href="Egyptian_Vulture" title="wikilink">Egyptian Vulture</a> in the late 1970s, and a <a href="Great_White_Pelican" title="wikilink">White Pelican</a> in the early 1980s, both carrying Israeli equipment used for <a href="animal_migration_tracking" title="wikilink">animal migration tracking</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Merops_apiaster_-_Tiergarten_Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nbrunn_5.jpg" title="fig:A living European Bee-eater." alt="A living European Bee-eater." /> In May 2012, a dead <a href="European_Bee-eater" title="wikilink">European Bee-eater</a> with an Israeli leg-band, used by naturalists to track migratory birds, was found by villagers near the south-eastern Turkish city of <a href="Gaziantep" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaziantep</a>. The villagers worried that the bird may have carried a micro-chip from Israeli intelligence to spy on the area and alerted local officials. At one point, a counter-terrorism unit became involved. Turkey's agriculture ministry examined the corpse of the bee-eater and assured villagers that it is common to equip migratory birds with rings in order to track their movements. The BBC correspondent, Jonathan Head, ascribed the event to his view that &quot;wildly implausible conspiracy theories take root easily in Turkey, with alleged Israeli plots among the most widely believed.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vulture">Vulture</h3>
<p>In December 2012, a <a href="Sudan" title="wikilink">Sudanese</a> newspaper reported that the Sudan government had captured a vulture, in the town of Kereinek, which they said was an Israeli spy bird and was tagged in Hebrew and equipped with electronic devices.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Jackson_Diehl" title="wikilink">Jackson Diehl</a> of the <em><a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a></em> also linked the two events, writing that Arab media and officials who circulate fantasies of Mossad sharks and spy birds &quot;deserve to be mocked&quot;. While mentioning <a href="Bret_Stephens" title="wikilink">Bret Stephens</a>' theory, that the conspiracy theories are an example of &quot;the debasement of the Arab mind&quot;, Diehl wrote that the paranoia in fact has also a more benign explanation, since Israel's real covert operations &quot;are almost as fantastic as the fantasies&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011, Jihad el Khazen of the Lebanese newspaper <em><a href="Al_Hayat" title="wikilink">Dar Al Hayat</a></em> published a column analyzing recent animal related conspiracy theories, explaining that the concept of conspiracy is not particular to Arabs.
