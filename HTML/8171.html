<p><a href="Bill_Brown_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Brown</a> was a member of <a href="Donald_Bradman" title="wikilink">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948" title="wikilink">Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948</a>. Bradman's men were undefeated in their 34 matches and this unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet <em>The Invincibles</em>.</p>
<p>An experienced right-handed <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">opening</a> batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, <a href="Sid_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sid Barnes</a> and <a href="Arthur_Morris" title="wikilink">Arthur Morris</a> had risen above him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener, a decision that was controversial among critics who believed that he was past his best.</p>
<p>Bradman rotated his three openers in the tour matches, but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">middle order</a>. However, Brown had appeared to be uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Brown had success in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He scored 1448 runs at 57.92 in all <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class matches</a>, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting averages</a>. He scored eight <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">centuries</a>, second only to Bradman, including 200 against <a href="Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a very circumspect manner in order to increase the reliability of his batting and volume of his scoring. A very occasional <a href="off_spin" title="wikilink">off spin</a> bowler, Brown took his first-class best of 4/16 from 25 balls in his only stint with the ball, against the <a href="South_of_England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South of England</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-tour">Early tour</h2>
<p>Brown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, in 1946â€“47 he was sidelined with injury and <a href="Sid_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sid Barnes</a> and <a href="Arthur_Morris" title="wikilink">Arthur Morris</a> opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Brown resumed his Test career the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after two Tests. He returned in the Fifth Test when Morris was rested.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the Tests against <a href="India_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> that season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties against India; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In any case, Brown had done enough to be chosen to <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948" title="wikilink">tour England with the <em>Invincibles</em> in 1948</a>, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order, while Barnes and Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> accumulating his runs at a <a href="strike_rate" title="wikilink">slower rate</a> than the other recognised batsmen.

<p>In the next match against <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a>, Morris was rested and Brown opened with Barnes. Brown scored 26 in an <a href="partnership_(cricket)" title="wikilink">opening stand</a> of 46, as Australia amassed 448 and won by an innings.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <img src="SidBarnesHeadshot.jpg" title="fig:Sid Barnes (pictured), one of Brown&#39;s opening partners during the tour." alt="Sid Barnes (pictured), one of Brown&#39;s opening partners during the tour." /> The Australians then proceeded to play <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>, on a <a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">damp pitch</a> that suited <a href="spin_bowling" title="wikilink">slower bowling</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the first innings, Brown took three catches from the bowling of <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a>, who had resorted to bowling <a href="off_spin" title="wikilink">off spin</a>, as Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown made 13 as the match remained finely balanced with Australia bowled out for 101.

<p>Brown was recalled for the match against <a href="Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> opening with Morris with Barnes rested. After putting on 64 for the opening wicket, Brown then added 176 with <a href="Ron_Hamence" title="wikilink">Ron Hamence</a> for the second wicket, and then 140 for the fourth wicket with acting captain <a href="Lindsay_Hassett" title="wikilink">Lindsay Hassett</a>, who was leading the team while Bradman rested himself. Brown top-scored with 200 and Hassett declared when Brown was out with the score at 4/414. Australia went on to win by an innings.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In the following match against <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex</a>, Brown opened with Barnes while Morris was rested.

Bradman came in and together with Brown, they accelerated and put on a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, before Brown was out for 153 from three hours of batting with the score at 2/364. He had scored his last 100 runs in less than 90 minutes.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Australia went on to score 721 runs on the day, the most number of runs amassed in a first-class match in one day.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Australia proceeded to another innings victory.

<p>The next match was against the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> at <a href="Lord&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Bradman installed Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown batted out of position at No. 6. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same positions.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> It was a chance for the respective players to gain a psychological advantage, but Brown did not make a large score.

<p>Brown returned for the following match and added a fourth century in less than three weeks, with 122 against <a href="Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Nottinghamshire</a>. Australia made 400 but the hosts hung on for a draw in the second innings.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In the following match against <a href="Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, Brown opened with Barnes and made a duck as Australia were dismissed for 117 on a damp pitch in reply to the home side's 195, the first time they had conceded a first innings lead in the tour.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182. This time Barnes fell for a <a href="duck_(cricket)" title="wikilink">duck</a>, and Brown anchored Australia to an eight-wicket win with an unbeaten 81 after a second-wicket partnership with <a href="Ian_Johnson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Ian Johnson</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The final match before the First Test was against <a href="Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Sussex</a>. Opening with Morris, Brown played second fiddle, accumulating 44 in an opening stand of 153. Morris went on to 184 and Australia 5/549 in another innings victory.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">not out</a>,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and was on his third tour of England.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In contrast, middle-order batsman <a href="Neil_Harvey" title="wikilink">Neil Harvey</a> had struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England, not passing 25 in his first six innings.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Although Harvey had scored an unbeaten 100 against Sussex, he had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="first-test">First Test</h2>

<p>Thus, Brown gained selection in the First Test at <a href="Trent_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trent Bridge</a>, batting out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>England batted first and made 165, with Brown prominent in the field. Early on the first day of play, opener <a href="Cyril_Washbrook" title="wikilink">Cyril Washbrook</a> was caught on the run by Brown on the <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">fine leg boundary</a> after attempting to <a href="Batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots" title="wikilink">hook Lindwall</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> leaving England at 2/15 after 41 minutes.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He later made a series of one-handed stops in the field, helping to keep the pressure on the batsmen.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He then took his second catch of the innings to remove <a href="Alec_Bedser" title="wikilink">Alec Bedser</a> after a rearguard fightback, with England ending on 165.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>On the second day, Barnes and Bradman took the score to 1/121 when Barnes and Miller were dismissed further addition to the score.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Brown came in at No. 5 to join Bradman, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and he looked unaccustomed to batting in the middle order.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Yardley took Laker out of the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes but the <a href="run_rate" title="wikilink">run rate</a> remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown <a href="leg_before_wicket" title="wikilink">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) with an <a href="off_cutter" title="wikilink">off cutter</a> in his first over.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and left Australia at 4/185.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Australia eventually reached 509, and after England compiled 441, Brown was not needed as Australia made the required 98 runs for the loss of only two wickets.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Between Tests, Brown was rested for the match against <a href="Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Northamptonshire</a>, which Australia won by an innings.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> He returned for the match against <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>. Opening with Barnes, Brown made 19 as Australia took a 43-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Brown top-scored with 113, combining with Bradman to add 154 runs for the second wicket as the match petered into a draw.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Brown took four hours in making his century in a patient and restrained display. Following his controversial selection, Brown was attempting to justify his selection by accumulating a large amount of runs, but earned criticism for being too dour.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This was enough to see him retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="second-test">Second Test</h2>

<p>In the Second Test at <a href="Lord&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>, Australia won the toss and batted first. Centurion Morris fell at 3/166 and Miller was then trapped for four.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Brown came in at 4/173 and helped Hassett rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets. Both scored slowly, taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> After putting on a stand of 43, Hassett was bowled by Yardley, who then trapped Brown for 24 to leave Australia stumbling at 6/225. Australia managed to avoid further collapse and ended at 350 before bowling England out for 215.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Australia batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329 and Australia reached stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Brown was caught behind from Coxon without adding to his score at lunch for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller with the score at 5/416, before Bradman declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> England lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the Test centuries he made in the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The next match was against <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> and started the day after the Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and <a href="Sam_Loxton" title="wikilink">Sam Loxton</a> chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dropped">Dropped</h2>
<p>For the following match against <a href="Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a> before the Third Test, Brown did not play.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> <a href="Sam_Loxton" title="wikilink">Sam Loxton</a> scored 159 not out, featuring in two century partnerships and propelling Australia to 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, underpinning an innings victory. This ousted Brown from his middle-order position for the Third Test at <a href="Old_Trafford" title="wikilink">Old Trafford</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> During the drawn Third Test, Barnes was injured and <a href="Ian_Johnson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Ian Johnson</a> was used as a makeshift opener now that Morris was the only specialist opener left with Brown having been omitted.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> In the meantime, Brown managed only eight as Australia defeated <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Barnes was still unavailable for the Fourth Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test to open; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Although Hassett failed with only 13 and 17, Harvey struck 112,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> as Australia chased down 404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run-chase and win by seven wickets.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>Brown partnered the recovered Barnes and patiently scored 140, being the fifth man out with the score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated <a href="Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a> by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Looking to regain his Test position by weight of runs, Brown started slowly, with Barnes making 24 of the first 29 runs.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the spectators, before accelerating and scoring the next 50 in 37 minutes.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>In the next match against <a href="Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Glamorgan</a>, Brown scored 16 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> He then scored 33 and seven, falling both times to <a href="Eric_Hollies" title="wikilink">Eric Hollies</a> as Australia defeated <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Brown was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Brown returned for the non-first-class match against <a href="Durham_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Durham</a>, scoring 49 out of Australia's 282 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Brown was overlooked for selection in the Fifth Test. Barnes returned to the team and Australia crushed England by an innings to take the series 4â€“0.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> <img src="Arthur_Morris.jpg" title="fig:Arthur Morris (pictured), one of Brown&#39;s opening partners during the tour." alt="Arthur Morris (pictured), one of Brown&#39;s opening partners during the tour." /></p>
<p>Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Australia batted first against <a href="Kent_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Kent</a> and Brown top-scored with 106. After putting on 64 with Morris, he put on 104 each for the next two wickets with Bradman and Harvey before falling at 3/272.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Brown again batted slowly, taking 255 minutes to reach triple figures, and was greeted with ironic clapping as he slowly accumulated the runs while his partners attacked.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Brown's dismissal triggered a collapse as Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Despite this, they completed an innings victory.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In the next match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's, Brown scored 120, featuring in a 180-run second wicket partnership with Bradman, as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> <a href="Jack_Fingleton" title="wikilink">Jack Fingleton</a> said &quot;Brown has always looked the class batsman that he is when playing at Lord's, and this superb century, so different in conception and execution to the one at <a href="Canterbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canterbury</a> [against Kent], made one reflect what a grand opening batsman this series of Tests had done without&quot;.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> He then made a duck but Australia nevertheless defeated <a href="Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Somerset</a> by an innings and 374 runs.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> He then made 13 against the <a href="South_of_England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South of England</a> in his last first-class match of the season.

<p>Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six England players from the season's Test series be allowed to compete. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for <a href="Doug_Ring" title="wikilink">Doug Ring</a>, while Brown missed out.

<p>The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. In the first match, Brown was rested as the Australians took an innings victory. In the second match, Brown scored 24 not out batting at No. 8, and then took a wicket in the second innings as Australia ended the tour with another innings victory.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
