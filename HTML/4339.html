<h2 id="recorded-history">Recorded history</h2>
<p>Kanyakumari takes its name from the Kumari Amman or Kanyakumari Temple, situated in the town, on the sea-shore, the very confluence of the three water-bodies &lt;U+2013&gt; the <a href="Arabian_Sea" title="wikilink">Arabian Sea</a>, the <a href="Bay_of_Bengal" title="wikilink">Bay of Bengal</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>. In his work on ancient India, Ptolemy had identified Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) along with the Gulf of Mannar as a center for pearl fishery. He also identifies <em>Korkai</em>, a place to the east of Kanyakumari as an emporium of pearl trade, also Travancore Census 1931 says that <a href="Paravar" title="wikilink">Paravars</a> ruled that Coast and built the temple for their reverence to Sea Goddess.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="myths-and-legends">Myths and legends</h2>

<p>There are multiple myths revolving around this place:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Hindu legend, <a href="Kanya_Devi" title="wikilink">Kanya Devi</a>, an <a href="Avatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avatar</a> of Parvati, was to marry Siva, but as he failed to show up on his wedding day, the rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and remain unused thereafter. As the legend goes, the uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones which look like rice on the shore today, are indeed grains of the wedding that was never solemnized. <a href="Kanya_Devi" title="wikilink">Kanya Devi</a> is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock the town.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to another Hindu legend, <a href="Hanuman" title="wikilink">Lord Hanuman</a> dropped a piece of earth as he was carrying a mountain with his life-saving herb, <a href="Mrita_Sanjivani" title="wikilink">Mrita Sanjivani</a>, from the Himalayas to Lanka (<a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>) during the Rama-Ravana war. This chunk of earth is called <a href="Marunthuvazh_Malai" title="wikilink">Marunthuvazh Malai</a>, which is literally translated to &quot;hills where medicine lives&quot;.This is said to be the reason for the abundance of unique native medicinal plants in the area. <a href="Marunthuvazh_Malai" title="wikilink">Marunthuvazh Malai</a> is located near Kottaram about  from Kanyakumari town on the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sage <a href="Agasthya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agasthya</a>, who was himself an expert in medicinal herbs, is believed to have lived around this site in ancient days. The reason why, some believe, so many medicinal herbs are to be found on these hills near Kanyakumari. There is even a village by the name <a href="Agastheeswaram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agastheeswaram</a> close to the town, named after the sage. Today, there is a small <a href="Ashram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashram</a> on the middle of the Maruthuvazh Malai hill, which tourists visit (after a short trek from the base of the hill), both to visit the Ashram and also to take a glimpse of the sea near Kanyakumari a few kilometres away, and the greenery below.</li>

<p>Kanyakumari has been a great centre for art and religion for centuries. It was also an area of great trade and commerce. It was ruled by the <a href="Cholas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cholas</a>, the <a href="Chera_dynasty" title="wikilink">Cheras</a>, the <a href="Pandyan_kingdom" title="wikilink">Pandyas</a> and the <a href="Nayak_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">Nayaks</a>. The architectural beauty of the temples in the area are the works of these rulers. Later Kanyakumari became part of the <a href="Venad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venad</a> kingdom with its capital at <a href="Padmanabhapuram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Padmanabhapuram</a>. The king of Venad, Anizham Thirunal <a href="Marthanda_Varma" title="wikilink">Marthanda Varma</a>, established <a href="Travancore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Travancore</a> by extending his domain further north up to Azhva, during his reign from 1729 to 1758. By this, the present Kanyakumari District came to be known as Southern Travancore. In 1741, Maharaja <a href="Marthanda_Varma" title="wikilink">Marthanda Varma</a> defeated the Dutch East India Company at the famous <a href="Battle_of_Colachel" title="wikilink">Battle of Colachel</a>.</p>
<p>Kanyakumari was under the rule of the Paravar Kings till the downfall of Pandyas, and later by kings of Travancore under the overall suzerainty of the British until 1947, when India became independent. Travancore joined the independent Indian Union in 1947. The reign of the Travancore royals came to an end.</p>
<p>Under <a href="Travancore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Travancore</a> rule, the town, and the modern administrative district that bears its name, <a href="Kanyakumari_District" title="wikilink">Kanyakumari District</a>, progressed both socially and economically. Still a significant part of population study and speak <a href="Malayalam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malayalam</a> as their mother-tongue. The culture followed by Kanyakumari people is mixed and has more influence from <a href="Travancore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Travancore</a>.</p>
<p>In 1949, Kanyakumari became part of the reconstituted Travancore-Cochin State. Around this time, a popular agitation for the amalgamation of Kanyakumari District with Tamil Nadu by the Tamil-speaking people of the district intensified, under the leadership of <a href="Marshal_Nesamony" title="wikilink">Marshal Nesamony</a></p>
<p>Kumari Thanthai Marshal Nesamony was instrumental in the merger of Kanyakumari district with Tamil Nadu in 1956 during the linguistic reorganisation of states. Kanyakumari was integrated with Tamil Nadu (then known as Madras State) as per the language-based reorganisation of States.</p>
<p>Christianity arrived in South India around AD 52 through <a href="Thomas_(Apostle)" title="wikilink">St. Thomas</a>, one of the twelve Apostles of Christ. However, European missionaries, who arrived in the 16th century, propagated Christianity in the area. <a href="St._Francis_Xavier" title="wikilink">St. Francis Xavier</a> (April 7, 1506 &lt;U+2013&gt; December 2, 1552) was the pioneer in preaching Christianity in the present day Kanyakumari district. Islam is believed to have entered the southern part of India through Kanyakumari during the early part of the eighth century AD through traders and missionaries who came through sea-routes. Islam, Christianity and <a href="Jainism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jainism</a> have also contributed to the architectural wealth and literary heritage of the region.</p>

The land mass in and around the town are hilly and uneven, with many commercial buildings and hotels at the upper crest of the land mass with the sea visible below. The old areas of the town, where the natives live, are on the lower side. Many of the natives are into fishing activity and other maritime professions.</p>
<p>Tourism is one of the main activities of the town ; and many locals are employed in shell-craft and other tourism-related businesses.</p>
<p>It has a literacy rate of 98.6%. 40% or more are college degree holders.</p>

Because of this it is one of the few small towns in South India where one can see many of the different languages of India spoken in the street.</p>
<p>Of late, the promotion of tourism has increased, with attractions that do not include the town, such as the surrounding landscapes, as well as the historical and religious sites found around the district, being emphasised to a greater degree. Ultimately a total of 1.9 million tourists (domestic and foreign) visited Kanyakumari in 2007.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011555560100.htm" class="uri">http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011555560100.htm</a></ref></p>
<p>Though there are several places of tourist-interest in the town and district, Kanyakumari is especially popular in India for its spectacular and unique sunrise and sunset. The confluence of three ocean bodies &lt;U+2013&gt; the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea &lt;U+2013&gt; makes the sunrise and sunset even more special. On balmy, full-moon evenings, (locally called <a href="Chitra_Pournami" title="wikilink">Chitra Pournami</a>) one can also see the moon-rise and sunset at the same time.</p>

<li>Our Lady of Ransom Church situated in Kanyakumari,the place where the missionaries had preached the paravas and converted them to Christianity.The first church in the form of a thatched roof was built here in the early 15th century for venerating Santhosha Madha .The church at present stands 153 m tall and it was 100 years old.The new church was built in Gothic Architecture and it looks fabulous when seen with the seashore background, viewing from Our Lady of Ransom Arch near Church Road entrance.
<p>From the shore where the fishing boats are moored you can see the three towering spires of this off-white Gothic structure with a distinct Portuguese feel. The Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a more than 100-year-old building dedicated to Mother Mary. But what catches your eye first-up is the 153-foot-high (46 meters) central tower crowned with a Cross of pure gold. Truly a beautiful structure; the church looks particularly gorgeous against the molten-blue noon sky. Astonishingly, the grand Gothic fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade is a striking contrast to its almost bare interiors.</p>
<p>Once you tread in you will be goggled by its hollowness; no pews anywhere in sight, only a beautiful idol of Mother Mary clad in a sari &lt;U+2013&gt; like in most South Indian churches &lt;U+2013&gt; and a little Cross on the altar. This emptiness is further accentuated by colorful light patterns thrown by the stained-glass windows on the bare floor. And one is given to wonder that the church is probably no longer functional! On the contrary, in fact, the church holds mass regularly on the floor made of sand. Since the parish here predominantly comprise local fishing folks, mass is always held in the regional language Tamil.</p></li>
