<p>Following George's victory in November 1962, Lenore became the state's <a href="First_Lady" title="wikilink">First Lady</a>.

<p>While Lenore was a traditionalist who decried the <a href="women&#39;s_liberation_movement" title="wikilink">women's liberation movement</a> as being one of &quot;strident voices&quot;, she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> By 1966, she was telling audiences around the state, &quot;Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> She added that women &quot;represent a reservoir of public service which has hardly been tapped.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
