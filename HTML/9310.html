<p><strong><em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em></strong> is a <a href="Story_within_a_story" title="wikilink">show within a show</a> in the <a href="animated_television_series" title="wikilink">animated television series</a> <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>. It usually appears as a part of <em>The <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a> Show</em>, watched regularly by <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> and <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa Simpson</a>. Itself an animated cartoon, <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em> depicts an <a href="anthropomorphic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> blue <a href="mouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">mouse</a>, Itchy (voiced by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a>), who repeatedly kills an anthropomorphic <a href="black_cat" title="wikilink">black cat</a>, Scratchy (voiced by <a href="Harry_Shearer" title="wikilink">Harry Shearer</a>), making it a parody of <a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a>. The cartoon first appeared in the <em><a href="The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" title="wikilink">Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> <a href="The_Simpsons_shorts" title="wikilink">short</a> &quot;The Bart Simpson Show&quot;, which originally aired November 20, 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in <em>The Simpsons</em> was in the 1990 episode &quot;<a href="There&#39;s_No_Disgrace_Like_Home" title="wikilink">There's No Disgrace Like Home</a>&quot;. Typically presented as 15-60 second-long cartoons, the show is filled with over-the-top violence. <em>The Simpsons</em> also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em>, including Roger Meyers, Jr. (voiced by <a href="Alex_Rocco" title="wikilink">Alex Rocco</a> and <a href="Hank_Azaria" title="wikilink">Hank Azaria</a>), who runs the studio and produces the show.</p>
<p>Itchy and Scratchy are based on the cartoons <em><a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a></em> and <em><a href="Herman_and_Katnip" title="wikilink">Herman and Katnip</a></em>, and their names were inspired by &quot;Pixie and Dixie&quot;, who were mice on the cartoon show <em><a href="Pixie_and_Dixie_and_Mr._Jinks" title="wikilink">Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks</a></em>. The cartoons have since become popular among the show's writers and animators and are often added when an episode needs expanding. As the shorts became popular with fans, the writers decided to have full episodes that centered around the production of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em> and featured multiple shorts. The first was &quot;<a href="Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy_&amp;_Marge" title="wikilink">Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_2)" title="wikilink">season two</a>, 1990), which was a commentary on censorship. Other episodes to feature the show include &quot;<a href="Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy:_The_Movie" title="wikilink">Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_4)" title="wikilink">season four</a>, 1992), &quot;<a href="The_Front_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">The Front</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_4)" title="wikilink">season four</a>, 1993), &quot;<a href="Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy_Land" title="wikilink">Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_6)" title="wikilink">season six</a>, 1994), &quot;<a href="The_Day_the_Violence_Died" title="wikilink">The Day the Violence Died</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_7)" title="wikilink">season seven</a>, 1996) and &quot;<a href="The_Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy_&amp;_Poochie_Show" title="wikilink">The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_8)" title="wikilink">season eight</a>, 1997).</p>

<p><img src="Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy.png" title="fig:A scene from the opening sequence of the show" alt="A scene from the opening sequence of the show" width="200" /> <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em> is a <a href="Story_within_a_story" title="wikilink">show within a show</a> that appears occasionally in episodes of <em>The Simpsons</em>. They typically appear in the form of 15-60 second cartoons that are filled with over-the-top violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A complex backstory for the show has been established. The episode &quot;<a href="The_Day_the_Violence_Died" title="wikilink">The Day the Violence Died</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_7)" title="wikilink">season seven</a>, 1996) reveals that Chester J. Lampwick invented Itchy in 1919, but the character was stolen by Roger Meyers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, entitled <em>That Happy Cat</em>. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, did very poorly commercially. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together entitled <em>Steamboat Itchy</em>, a violent parody of <a href="Disney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disney</a>'s <em><a href="Steamboat_Willie" title="wikilink">Steamboat Willie</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">wartime</a> radio series,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> at least two films&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>Pinitchio</em> and <em>Scratchtasia</em>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and television commercials for <a href="List_of_products_in_The_Simpsons#Laramie_Cigarettes" title="wikilink">Laramie Cigarettes</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Itchy and Scratchy Studios is run by Roger Meyers, Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon's &quot;creator&quot;. Itchy and Scratchy Studios was bankrupted after it was sued by Lampwick for $800 billion, but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of <a href="Mr._ZIP" title="wikilink">Mr. ZIP</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>The Itchy and Scratchy Show</em> airs as a segment on the <a href="Krusty_the_Klown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Klown</a> show, but moved to the <a href="Krusty_Gets_Kancelled" title="wikilink">Gabbo</a> show during the latter's short-lived run.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The show underwent a non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge Simpson</a>, but after Marge was later discredited, it returned to its original violent format.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The show has spawned an <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a>-winning film adaptation,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> amusement parks,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and a musical.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy show is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent. The most direct and obvious example is <em><a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious. <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> also includes shorts such as &quot;Scratchtasia&quot;, a parody of <em><a href="Fantasia_(film)" title="wikilink">Fantasia</a></em>, and &quot;Pinitchio&quot;, a parody of <em><a href="Pinocchio_(1940_film)" title="wikilink">Pinocchio</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Itchy &amp; Scratchy are often used for animation-related jokes. For example, the <em>Manhattan Madness</em> cartoon in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot; is based on very early animated cartoons such as <em><a href="Gertie_the_Dinosaur" title="wikilink">Gertie the Dinosaur</a></em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Itchy and Scratchy often play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in &quot;<a href="Deep_Space_Homer" title="wikilink">Deep Space Homer</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">season five</a>, 1994), Homer is recruited by <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a>, and later watches an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films <em><a href="2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="wikilink">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> and <em><a href="Alien_(film)" title="wikilink">Alien</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-itchy-scratchy-show"><em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em></h3>
<p><strong>Itchy and Scratchy</strong> are the main characters in the show. The duo first appeared in <em><a href="The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" title="wikilink">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></em> <a href="The_Simpsons_shorts" title="wikilink">short</a> &quot;The Bart Simpson Show&quot;, which aired November 20, 1988. Their first appearance in <em>The Simpsons</em> was &quot;<a href="There&#39;s_No_Disgrace_Like_Home" title="wikilink">There's No Disgrace Like Home</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Itchy, voiced by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a>, is a <a href="blue" class="uri" title="wikilink">blue</a> <a href="mouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">mouse</a>, and usually the aggressor and the victor over the hapless Scratchy in their battles. An exception is in &quot;<a href="Homer_Goes_to_College" title="wikilink">Homer Goes to College</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">season five</a>, 1993). Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called &quot;Burning Down the Mouse&quot;, as Lisa puts it, &quot;This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.&quot; However, due to the Simpsons' television being unplugged, the viewer does not see the end of the cartoon and Krusty proclaims that the network will never let it be shown again.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Scratchy, voiced by <a href="Harry_Shearer" title="wikilink">Harry Shearer</a>, is a <a href="black_cat" title="wikilink">black cat</a> and is the victim of much abuse from the <a href="Sadistic_personality_disorder" title="wikilink">sadistic</a> Itchy. The writers often forget which character is which; a trick they use is that Scratchy contains the letters c, a and t.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Poochie</strong>, voiced by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a>, is an anthropomorphic dog that appeared in &quot;<a href="The_Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy_&amp;_Poochie_Show" title="wikilink">The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show</a>&quot; (<a href="The_Simpsons_(season_8)" title="wikilink">season eight</a>, 1997). In the episode, the producers of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em> believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer Simpson</a> gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, &quot;The Beagle Has Landed&quot;. A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of <em>The Simpsons</em>. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious because he was so rich, rather than because he was so cool.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in &quot;<a href="Treehouse_of_Horror_IX" title="wikilink">Treehouse of Horror IX</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Little_Big_Mom" title="wikilink">Little Big Mom</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

He distributes the cartoon and is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for the children who comprise his audience.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He also possesses an extremely obnoxious personality, where he only cares about people who can help him.

<p>Alex Rocco also voices Meyers in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot; and &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. He said that he liked voicing Meyers because &quot;I get to be a big-shot.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, he professed being nervous when voicing the character for the first time in &quot;<a href="Itchy_&amp;_Scratchy_&amp;_Marge" title="wikilink">Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge</a>&quot; because he said that he had never done a <a href="voice-over" class="uri" title="wikilink">voice-over</a> before.

<p>The spelling of Meyers' name has been inconsistent in the show.

<p><strong>Roger Meyers, Sr.</strong> first appeared in video footage in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land&quot; and has never had a speaking role. He was created because the writers felt it would have been &quot;tortured logic&quot; to have the Roger Meyers, Jr. be the creator.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Roger Meyers Sr has similarities to <a href="Walt_Disney" title="wikilink">Walt Disney</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> For example, Disney's alleged <a href="antisemitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">antisemitism</a> is spoofed when it is revealed that Meyers made a cartoon called <em>Nazi Supermen are our Superiors</em>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>June Bellamy</strong>, voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>, is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy.

It is assumed she is a reference to veteran voice actress <a href="June_Foray" title="wikilink">June Foray</a>, based on the same first name.

<p><strong>Chester J. Lampwick</strong>, voiced by <a href="Kirk_Douglas" title="wikilink">Kirk Douglas</a>, is the creator of Itchy and only appeared in &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;. Douglas was not the producers' first choice for the character, they first wanted <a href="William_Hickey_(actor)" title="wikilink">William Hickey</a>, but he turned them down.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Douglas's recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the earphones supplied to him in the recording studio, and said the maximum he would do was two takes.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Writing staff</strong>: In several episodes revolving around the production of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em>, caricatures of the show's staff are used as the staff of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em>.

<p>David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are &quot;an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it's taken to a more realistic level.

<p>Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are often added when a show needs expanding or when there is an issue that the writers wish to satirize.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In some cases, notably in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, the writers use Itchy &amp; Scratchy as a way to comment on <em>The Simpsons</em>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The shorts are often hard for the writers and take a long time to develop and come up with a title for the short and in the end they do not fill up a large amount of time.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Writing the Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Itchy &amp; Scratchy are a favorite of <a href="John_Swartzwelder" title="wikilink">John Swartzwelder</a>, who has written many of the episodes that center around them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy &amp; Scratchy, so the writers decided to do &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;, an episode also dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The cartoons are often kept short, because according to David Silverman, &quot;it doesn't really work as a long cartoon.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
