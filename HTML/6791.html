<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="kmart">Kmart</h3>
<p>In <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a>, <a href="Kmart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kmart</a> acquired OfficeMax to join its other subsidiaries, <a href="Sports_Authority" title="wikilink">Sports Authority</a> and <a href="Builders_Square" title="wikilink">Builders Square</a>. Shortly after the acquisition Kmart merged its other subsidiary, Office Square, into OfficeMax. Kmart also acquired BizMart and merged it into OfficeMax in 1992. Kmart, however, sold OfficeMax in <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a>.</p>
<h3 id="boise-cascade">Boise Cascade</h3>
<p>The company was acquired by <a href="Boise_Cascade" title="wikilink">Boise Cascade</a> in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, and has undergone numerous internal changes since then, including rebranding its <a href="Photocopying" title="wikilink">copy</a> and <a href="Printing" title="wikilink">print</a> centers from <strong>CopyMax</strong> to <strong>OfficeMax Print &amp; Document Services</strong>. This change was primarily to prevent customers from getting the idea that it was only a copy service. In Q4 2006 the company rolled out a new branding for their printing and finishing service after finding that OfficeMax Print &amp; Document Services was too sterile of a name. The current name for the printing department is <strong>OfficeMax ImPress</strong> <a href="http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/services/CopyMax/CopyMax.jsp">1</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="furniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">furniture</a> section of the retail stores is often marketed separately as <strong>FurnitureMax</strong>, though officially only a few stores have true <strong>FurnitureMax</strong> sections, characterized by much larger selections than normal OfficeMaxes. OfficeMax has 867 retail stores in the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a> (including <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>) and 43 locations in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> (through a joint venture), in addition to an on-line retailer in the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a> (OfficeMax.com). In October 2004, Boise Cascade completed its sale of its paper, building products, and timberland assets. It then renamed itself OfficeMax.</p>
<h3 id="financial-rebound">Financial Rebound</h3>
<p>In Q1 2006, OfficeMax closed 110 underperforming domestic stores, and is opening 70 new stores with the new award winning &quot;Advantage&quot; store layout.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The &quot;Advantage&quot; store design is supposed to be more customer friendly and includes improvements in all major departments inside an OfficeMax store. The company plans to remodel most or all of its stores to the new Advantage layout.</p>
<p>In 2007, the average price per share of OfficeMax stock has risen to $50+.</p>

<h3 id="ink-cartridge-recycling">Ink Cartridge Recycling</h3>
<p>OfficeMax originally offered only recycled paper in exchange for ink cartridges, at first limiting the cartridges to HP only, and 2 at a time, then later expanding it to HP, Lexmark, Dell, and Canon cartridges and 5 at a time. However, the customer was not required to purchase anything to redeem their cartridges. To help drive ink sales, customers today only have the option of recycling their cartridges for $3 each off of their purchase, up to 5. Inkjets recycling is limited to HP, Canon, Dell, Lexmark, or Brother cartridges. Toner cartridges can also be recycled.</p>
<h3 id="officemax-ink...">OfficeMax, Ink...</h3>
<p>Starting in 2005 and ending early 2006, OfficeMax tested a semi-automated ink refill station in their stores in the Chicago area. Customers could bring in old HP, Lexmark, Dell, Canon, or Compaq cartridges, and have them tested and refilled. The cost of the refilling ranges from $2 below a new cartridge up to 50% off.</p>
<p>As of July 2006, OfficeMax is now outfitting all of their high profit stores with the ink refill machines. Stores in the Houston districts were the first to receive the new machines.</p>
<h3 id="maxperks">MaxPerks</h3>

The minimum amount spent in order to receive a 1% rebate is $300. The more the customer spends, the more they get back at the end of each quarter in the form of a gift card.

Through this program, the customer also receives many coupons through the mail.</p>

<p>MaxAssurance is a replacement plan that OfficeMax offers on any electronic device, or furniture item.

<p>MaxAssurance covers many things such as normal wear and tear, and accidental damage. The coverage of accidental damage is a key selling point for employees.</p>
<p>Coverage for different items is different. On any electronic item below $400, the MaxAssurance can cover 2 years on top of the manufacturer's limited warranty on items $50 or more, otherwise you can only purchase a 1 year MaxAssurance from OfficeMax for any electronic item $49.99 and lower. This is the only actual replacement plan that OfficeMax Offers, the other MaxAssurances are Repair Plans, where OfficeMax would come on site, and fix it for you, if it can't be fixed, then it would be replaced. With this, OfficeMax also has a &quot;No Lemon&quot; policy, meaning that if the repaired item breaks more than 3 times, they will replace it anyways. On Electronics above $400 there is a 1, 2, and 3 year repair plan, it works though the manufacturer's warranty, and the years on the plan start after the manufacturer's warranty. With Furniture, the MaxAssurance is 3 years starting 31 days after the date of purchase, and though those 31 days. On the computer MaxAssurance, they are priced differently for the Laptop Computers, from the Desktop Computers. The coverage starts the second you leave the store and cover for 3 years. With the Computer MaxAssurance, the MaxAssurance will cover up to 2 peripherals to the computer, such as Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Speakers, etc.</p>
