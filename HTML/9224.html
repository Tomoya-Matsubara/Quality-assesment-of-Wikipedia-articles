<p><img src="Partick_320322.jpg" title="fig:Passengers join a westbound service" alt="Passengers join a westbound service" /> <strong>Partick station</strong> is a combined <a href="railway_station" title="wikilink">railway station</a> and <a href="metro_station" title="wikilink">underground station</a> in the <a href="Partick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Partick</a> area of <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a>, <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. It, along with an adjacent bus station, forms one of the main <a href="transport_interchange" title="wikilink">transport hubs</a> in Glasgow with regular services to many locations in <a href="Greater_Glasgow" title="wikilink">Greater Glasgow</a> and wider <a href="Strathclyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strathclyde</a>. The station was one of the first to receive bilingual English and <a href="Scottish_Gaelic" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> signs, because there is a significant Gaelic-speaking population in the Partick area.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The first station in the area was the <a href="North_British_Railway" title="wikilink">North British Railway</a>'s , opened in 1887 slightly to the north of the existing site on the opposite side of the Dumbarton Road. Soon after, the <a href="Glasgow_Subway" title="wikilink">Glasgow Subway</a> opened and its <a href="Merkland_Street_station" title="wikilink">Merkland Street station</a>, slightly to the south of the existing station site, opened in December 1896. Neither was independently known as &quot;Partick station&quot; as there were two other railway stations in Partick between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries:  (later renamed Kelvin Hall station) to the east with  and  to the west.</p>
<h2 id="argyle-line-opening">Argyle Line opening</h2>
<p>The <a href="Beeching_Axe" title="wikilink">Beeching Axe</a> of the 1960s closed  and , both on the <a href="Lanarkshire_and_Dunbartonshire_Railway" title="wikilink">Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway</a> link to the <a href="Stobcross_Railway" title="wikilink">Stobcross Railway</a> and <a href="Glasgow_Central_Railway" title="wikilink">Glasgow Central Railway</a>, leaving just the two stations in Partick, with Partickhill station - which escaped closure owing to being on the newly electrified (1960) North Clyde line from Queen Street Low Level, served by the 'Blue Trains', with a major pre-electrification refurbishment in 1958. It stood a few hundred yards north of Merkland Street. The amalgamation of the two stations to a single site came in 1979, as a major refurbishment of the Glasgow Subway coincided with the <a href="Greater_Glasgow_Passenger_Transport_Executive" title="wikilink">Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive</a>'s decision to reopen part of the <a href="Glasgow_Central_Railway" title="wikilink">Glasgow Central Railway</a>, which had been axed by <a href="Beeching_Axe" title="wikilink">Beeching</a>, as the <a href="Argyle_Line" title="wikilink">Argyle Line</a> and connecting it to the North Clyde system just east of Partick. Both stations were closed (Merkland Street had been since the Subway works began in May 1977, whilst Partickhill remained in service for several months after the Argyle Line opened, until replaced by the current Partick station) and replaced with a new combined Partick station in the middle. The platforms at Partickhill are still visible from the North Clyde/Argyle Line, although access to Dumbarton Road is now blocked. The Merkland Street station buildings are no longer visible.</p>
<p>The station is one of the primary stations on the Argyle Line and <a href="North_Clyde_Line" title="wikilink">North Clyde Line</a> of the Glasgow suburban rail network. These lines primarily provide services to the east and west although the station itself is orientated north-south with two platforms. Statistically, it is the tenth busiest railway station in Scotland<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the fifth busiest passenger interchange when subway and bus journeys from the site are included.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Partick station is on a busy section of the Strathclyde rail network, served by all services on the <a href="Argyle_Line" title="wikilink">Argyle Line</a> and <a href="North_Clyde_Line" title="wikilink">North Clyde Line</a>.</p>

<p>Many journeys that interchange between the Argyle and North Clyde lines require passengers to change at Partick, as it is the closest station to central Glasgow with direct services to both  and  main line stations.</p>

<h2 id="subway-station">Subway station</h2>

<p><strong>Partick subway station</strong> is one of the largest stations on the <a href="Glasgow_Subway" title="wikilink">Glasgow Subway</a> network, and has around 1.01 million boardings per year.<a href="http://www.spt.co.uk/publications/stats2005/s&amp;t2005.pdf">1</a> This is due in part to its situation within the city and also the National Rail network. <a href="Partick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Partick</a> is a relatively large population centre of Glasgow housing around 100,000 people, a significant number of whom use the subway to commute to the city centre.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Partick station is an interchange for two lines on the National Rail network. People commuting from outside of Glasgow to one of the areas covered by the underground network may choose to continue their journey from Partick to allow for ease of transfer between the services and to avoid a lengthy walk between (for example) <a href="Glasgow_Central_station" title="wikilink">Glasgow Central</a> and <a href="St._Enoch_subway_station" title="wikilink">St. Enoch</a>.</p>
<p>It is one of only three with a dual <a href="side_platform" title="wikilink">side platform</a> layout (the others being <a href="Govan_subway_station" title="wikilink">Govan</a> and <a href="St_Enoch_subway_station" title="wikilink">St Enoch</a>). The rest have either a single central platform covering both circles or two platforms with a track running at the same side of each. The new Partick station replaced <a href="Merkland_Street_subway_station" title="wikilink">Merkland Street</a>, which was located to the south, after modernisation. It should not be confused with the old <a href="Partick_Cross_subway_station" title="wikilink">Partick Cross subway station</a> which is now known as <a href="Kelvinhall_subway_station" title="wikilink">Kelvinhall</a> and is the station directly preceding or following Partick, depending upon the direction of travel.</p>
<p>It is the only station on the Subway that interchanges <em>directly</em> with a railway station, although <a href="Buchanan_Street_subway_station" title="wikilink">Buchanan Street station</a> is linked to <a href="Glasgow_Queen_Street_railway_station" title="wikilink">Queen Street</a> by a length of <a href="travelator" title="wikilink">moving walkway</a>. <a href="St_Enoch_subway_station" title="wikilink">St. Enoch</a> once shared this distinction, before its parent <a href="St_Enoch_railway_station" title="wikilink">St Enoch railway station</a> was closed and demolished in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Partick is one of three subway stations on the SPT Subway line to benefit from mobile telephone service nodes, the others being <a href="Buchanan_Street_subway_station" title="wikilink">Buchanan Street</a> and <a href="Hillhead_subway_station" title="wikilink">Hillhead</a>. These nodes allow users of the <a href="O2_(UK)" title="wikilink">O2</a> cellular network to use their mobile telephones while waiting on a subway train. The idea was to trial the technology at the busiest stations and, if successful, to put similar devices at each station eventually extending service across the entire network. As yet, the trial is incomplete.</p>




<h2 id="modernisation">Modernisation</h2>
<h3 id="project">2005-2009 project</h3>
<p><img src="Partick_eastbound_waiting_room.jpg" title="fig:Inside the eastbound waiting room" alt="Inside the eastbound waiting room" /> <a href="Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport" title="wikilink">Strathclyde Passenger Transport</a> began planning an extensive modernisation of the Partick station site - which had remained largely unchanged since its opening in 1979 - as early as 1998. Work began in late 2005 and was originally scheduled for completion in January 2007. However, delays to the project resulted in this date being put back on a number of occasions. The demolition and construction work was carried out while the site remained open to avoid any disruption in rail and underground services, arguably one of the most ambitious attributes of the project.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The total cost of the project was estimated to be around &lt;U+00A3&gt;12.3 million with professional fees and third-party costs accounting for &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.6 million of this. However due to delays in the progression of the works and unforeseen difficulties - such as ground conditions on the land the station occupies, only discovered after the commencement of work - the company in charge of the development, C Spencer Construction, made a claim for a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;6.3 million.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 2009, the project finally reached its conclusion and on 31 March, the new station was officially opened to the public. The work done includes the construction of a completely new and modern station building which incorporates a brand new ticket office (which has been in use since 2008). The station concourse has been completely renovated and new signs have been posted similar to those seen in  and <a href="Glasgow_Queen_Street_railway_station" title="wikilink">Queen Street</a> stations. Both railway platforms have been refurbished and now have their own indoor waiting rooms. Lifts linking the concourse to the National Rail platforms were installed.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="project-1">2012-2013 project</h3>
<p>The Subway platforms were renovated between summer 2012 and spring 2013 at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.2 million. All floor, wall, and ceiling finishes were replaced with new contemporary designs. Improved lighting, signage, and facilities for disabled people were introduced.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Lifts linking the concourse to the Subway platforms were be installed as part of this project because the necessary land is not owned by SPT. The future provision of lifts has, however, been safeguarded.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
