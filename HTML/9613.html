<h2 id="civil-war">Civil War</h2>
<p><img src="John_J._Crittenden_-_Brady-Handy.jpg" title="fig:John Crittenden in his elder years." alt="John Crittenden in his elder years." width="230" /> Crittenden was torn by loyalties during the <a href="US_Civil_War" title="wikilink">US Civil War</a>, with one son leaving to join the Union and the other enlisting with the <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate States of America</a>. In December, 1860 he promoted a last minute compromise to hold the Union together, the <a href="Crittenden_Compromise" title="wikilink">Crittenden Compromise</a>. It consisted of six unamendable amendments to the Constitution. These amendments would have made permanent the <a href="Missouri_Compromise" title="wikilink">Missouri Compromise</a> of 1820, denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade, compelled Congress to compensate owners who lost slaves in the North through illegal interference with the fugitive slave laws, made perpetual the <a href="fugitive_slave_law" title="wikilink">fugitive slave law</a> and <a href="three-fifths_compromise" title="wikilink">three-fifths compromise</a> to the Constitution, and denied to Congress any power to interfere with slavery in the existing Southern states.</p>
<p><img src="JJC.jpg" title="fig:John Crittenden" alt="John Crittenden" width="220" /> But Republicans, especially president-elect <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a>, rejected it and it never came to a vote. Crittenden then tried to salvage his plan by recommending to the full Senate that it be submitted to the people in referendum, but a majority of the Republicans in the Senate again voted against the measure.</p>
<p>His next compromise the <a href="Crittenden-Johnson_Resolution" title="wikilink">Crittenden-Johnson Resolution</a> was adopted by Congress on <a href="July_22" title="wikilink">July 22</a>, <a href="1861" class="uri" title="wikilink">1861</a>, immediately after the disastrous <a href="battle_of_Bull_Run" title="wikilink">battle of Bull Run</a>, Congress gave official definition to the object of the war: the war was prosecuted on the part of the federal government not to conquer or subjugate the Southern States, that is, not to reduce them to provinces, nor to interfere with slavery in those states; but to preserve the Union and to defend and maintain the Constitution and the laws, &quot;with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several states unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease.&quot; [<em>Congressional Globe</em>, July 22, 1861] The resolutions were repealed in December.</p>
<p>He was elected as a <a href="United_States_Constitutional_Union_Party" title="wikilink">Unionist</a> to the 37th Congress (<a href="March_4" title="wikilink">March 4</a> <a href="1861" class="uri" title="wikilink">1861</a> - <a href="March_3" title="wikilink">March 3</a> <a href="1863" class="uri" title="wikilink">1863</a>). He was a candidate for reelection to that office at the time of his death. He died in Frankfort, Kentucky and is interred at the State Cemetery there.</p>
