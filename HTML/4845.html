<p>The <strong>Chinese Civil War</strong> (), which lasted from April 1927 to May 1950, was a <a href="civil_war" title="wikilink">civil war</a> in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> between the <a href="Kuomintang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuomintang</a> (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party) and the <a href="Chinese_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Chinese Communist Party</a> (CPC).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The war began in 1927, after the <a href="Northern_Expedition_(1926&lt;U+2013&gt;1927)" title="wikilink">Northern Expedition</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The war represented an <a href="ideology" title="wikilink">ideological</a> split between the Western-supported Nationalist KMT, and the Soviet-supported Communist CPC.</p>
<p>The civil war carried on intermittently until the looming <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> interrupted it, resulting in an organized and temporary <a href="Second_United_Front_(China)" title="wikilink">Chinese resistance to the Japanese</a> invasion. The Japanese assault and occupation was an opportunistic attack made possible by China's own state of internal turmoil. Japan's campaign was defeated in August, 1945 by the <a href="Allies" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allies</a>, marking the end of <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a>, and China's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. Hostilities ended after 23 years in 1950, with an unofficial cessation of major hostilities, with the CPC controlling <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a> (including <a href="Hainan" title="wikilink">Hainan Island</a>) and the KMT restricted to their remaining territories of <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Pescadores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pescadores</a>, and the <a href="list_of_islands_of_the_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">several outlying Fujianese islands</a>.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The <a href="Qing_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Qing Dynasty</a> collapsed in 1911.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> China was left under the control of several major and lesser warlords in the <a href="Warlord_era" title="wikilink">Warlord era</a>. To defeat the warlords who had seized control of much of <a href="Northern_China" title="wikilink">Northern China</a> since the collapse of the <a href="Qing_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Qing Dynasty</a>, the anti-monarchist and national unificationist <a href="Kuomintang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuomintang</a> party and its leader <a href="Sun_Yat-sen" title="wikilink">Sun Yat-sen</a> sought the help of foreign powers. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1921 he turned to the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established <a href="Communist_Party_of_China" title="wikilink">Communist Party of China</a>. The Soviets hoped for Communist consolidation, but were prepared for either side to emerge victorious. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.</p>
<p>In 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative <a href="Adolph_Joffe" title="wikilink">Adolph Joffe</a> in <a href="Shanghai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a> pledged Soviet assistance for China's unification.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <a href="Sun-Joffe_Manifesto" title="wikilink">Sun-Joffe Manifesto</a> was a declaration for cooperation among the <a href="Comintern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Comintern</a>, <a href="KMT" class="uri" title="wikilink">KMT</a> and the <a href="Communist_Party_of_China" title="wikilink">Communist Party of China</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Comintern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Comintern</a> agent <a href="Mikhail_Borodin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Borodin</a> began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>. The CPC joined the KMT to form the <a href="First_United_Front_(China)" title="wikilink">First United Front</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1923, Sun Yat-sen sent <a href="Chiang_Kai-shek" title="wikilink">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, one of Sun's lieutenants from <a href="Tongmeng_Hui" title="wikilink">Tongmeng Hui</a> days, for several months' military and political study in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By 1924, Chiang became head of the <a href="Whampoa_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">Whampoa Military Academy</a>, rising to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Soviets provided much studying material, organization, and munitions for the academy.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Soviets also provided many techniques on mass mobilization. With this dedicated &quot;army of the party,&quot; Sun Yat-sen hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them, including <a href="Zhou_Enlai" title="wikilink">Zhou Enlai</a>, was made a political instructor of the academy.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Communist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The CPC was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The KMT in 1923 had 50,000 members.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Just months after <a href="Sun_Yat_Sen" title="wikilink">Sun Yat Sen</a>'s death in 1925, Chiang-Kai-Shek, as commander-in-chief of the <a href="National_Revolutionary_Army" title="wikilink">National Revolutionary Army</a>, set out on the <a href="Northern_Expedition_(1926&lt;U+2013&gt;1927)" title="wikilink">Northern Expedition</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. By 1926, however, the KMT had divided into left and right wing factions.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Communist bloc within it was also growing. In the March 1926 <a href="Zhongshan_Warship_Incident" title="wikilink">Zhongshan Warship Incident</a>, after thwarting an alleged kidnapping attempt against him, Chiang imposed restrictions on CPC members' participation in the top KMT leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent KMT leader.</p>

<p>In early 1927, the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from <a href="Guangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangzhou</a> to <a href="Wuhan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wuhan</a>, where Communist influence was strong.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> But Chiang and <a href="Li_Zongren" title="wikilink">Li Zongren</a>, whose armies defeated warlord <a href="Sun_Chuanfang" title="wikilink">Sun Chuanfang</a>, moved eastward toward <a href="Jiangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiangxi</a>. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand and Chiang denounced the leftists for betraying Sun Yat-sen's <a href="Three_Principles_of_the_People" title="wikilink">Three Principles of the People</a> by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a>, Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>On April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting arguing that communist activities were socially and economically disruptive, and must be undone for the national revolution to proceed. As a result of this, on April 12, Chiang turned on the CPC in Shanghai. The incident purged the KMT leftists by arresting and executing hundreds of CPC members.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The incident was called <a href="April_12_Incident" title="wikilink">April 12 Incident</a> or <a href="April_12_Incident" title="wikilink">Shanghai Massacre</a> by the CPC.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The massacre widened the rift between Chiang and <a href="Wang_Jingwei" title="wikilink">Wang Jingwei</a>'s Wuhan.

An armed rural insurrection, known as the <a href="Autumn_Harvest_Uprising" title="wikilink">Autumn Harvest Uprising</a> was staged by peasants, minors and CPC members in <a href="Hunan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hunan</a> Province led by <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The uprising was unsuccessful.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> There now were three capitals in China, the internationally recognized republic capital in <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the CPC and left-wing KMT at Wuhan;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the right-wing KMT regime at Nanjing, which would remain the KMT capital for the next decade.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The CPC had been expelled from Wuhan by their left-wing KMT allies, who in turn were toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed the campaign against <a href="Warlord_era" title="wikilink">warlords</a> and captured Beijing in June 1928.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Afterwards most of <a href="East_China" title="wikilink">eastern China</a> was under the Nanjing central government's control, and the Nanjing government received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China.

<p>During the 1920s, Communist Party of China activists retreated underground or to the countryside where they fomented a military revolt, beginning the <a href="Nanchang_Uprising" title="wikilink">Nanchang Uprising</a> on <a href="August_1" title="wikilink">August 1</a>, <a href="1927" class="uri" title="wikilink">1927</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> They combined the force with remnants of <a href="peasant" class="uri" title="wikilink">peasant</a> rebels, and established control over several areas in <a href="southern_China" title="wikilink">southern China</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Guangzhou commune was able to control Guangzhou for three days and a &quot;soviet&quot; was established.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> KMT armies continue to suppress the rebellions.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This marked the beginning of the ten year's struggle, known in <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a> as the &quot;Ten Year's Civil War&quot; ().

<p>In 1930 the <a href="Central_Plains_War" title="wikilink">Central Plains War</a> broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by <a href="Feng_Y&lt;U+00FC&gt;-hsiang" title="wikilink">Feng Y&lt;U+00FC&gt;-hsiang</a>, <a href="Yen_Hsi-shan" title="wikilink">Yen Hsi-shan</a>, and <a href="Wang_Ching-wei" title="wikilink">Wang Ching-wei</a>. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of <a href="Encirclement_Campaigns" title="wikilink">encirclement campaigns</a>. There were a total of five campaigns.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The <a href="First_Encirclement_Campaign" title="wikilink">first</a> and <a href="Second_Encirclement_Campaign" title="wikilink">second</a> campaigns failed and the <a href="Third_Encirclement_Campaign" title="wikilink">third</a> was aborted due to the <a href="Mukden_Incident" title="wikilink">Mukden Incident</a>. The <a href="Fourth_Encirclement_Campaign" title="wikilink">fourth campaign</a> (1932-1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang&lt;U+2019&gt;s armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Soviet_Chinese_Republic" title="wikilink">Soviet Chinese Republic</a>. During these campaigns, the KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.</p>
<p>Finally, in late 1933, Chiang launched a <a href="Fifth_Encirclement_Campaign" title="wikilink">fifth campaign</a> that involved the systematic encirclement of the <a href="Jiangxi_Soviet" title="wikilink">Jiangxi Soviet</a> region with fortified <a href="blockhouse" title="wikilink">blockhouses</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Unlike in previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by five or so miles to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food source.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 1934, the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the troops of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than the KMT themselves) to escape <a href="Jiangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiangxi</a>. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of wasting their own men, and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating <a href="Zhang_Guotao" title="wikilink">Zhang Guotao</a>'s army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered 12,500 km (25,000 <a href="Li_(unit)" title="wikilink">Li</a>), and was known as the famous <a href="Long_March" title="wikilink">Long March</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The march ended when the CPC reached the interior of <a href="Shaanxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shaanxi</a>. <a href="Zhang_Guotao" title="wikilink">Zhang Guotao</a>'s army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his <a href="Hui" title="wikilink">Chinese Muslim</a> ally, the <a href="Ma_clique" title="wikilink">Ma clique</a>. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000-100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000-8,000 made it to Shaanxi.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.</p>

<p>During the <a href="Imperial_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> invasion and <a href="Imperial_Japanese_colonialism_in_Manchukuo" title="wikilink">occupation of Manchuria</a>, Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with the CPC to fight against the <a href="Japanese_Imperial_Army" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>.

<p>In the last month of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> in <a href="East_Asia" title="wikilink">East Asia</a>, Soviet forces launched the mammoth <a href="Operation_August_Storm" title="wikilink">Operation August Storm</a> to attack the Japanese in Manchuria.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This operation destroyed the fighting capability of the <a href="Kwantung_Army" title="wikilink">Kwantung Army</a> and left the USSR in occupation of all of Manchuria at the end of the war. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year, Chiang Kai-shek came to the painful realization that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure. He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region. KMT troops were then <a href="airlift" title="wikilink">airlifted</a> by the United States to occupy key cities in <a href="North_China" title="wikilink">North China</a>, while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC.

<p><a href="George_Marshall" title="wikilink">General Marshall</a> himself stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC were being supplied by the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The CPC did benefit indirectly from the elimination of the Japanese <a href="Kwantung_Army" title="wikilink">Kwantung Army</a> but the Soviets did not provide direct support to the CPC during this period as they expected either a power-sharing arrangement or a KMT victory. The CPC were able to capture a number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese and KMT including some tanks but it was not until large numbers of well trained KMT troops joined the communist force that the CPC were finally able to master the hardware.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Anti-Japanese Koreans also played an important role, with 30-40 thousand Korean troops participating in the war on the Communist side. Koreans are also credited with repairing Manchurian railroads and bridges which were used by Mao.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1947 the KMT seized the CPC capital of <a href="Yenan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yenan</a>. By late 1948 the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of <a href="Mukden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mukden</a> and <a href="Changchun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Changchun</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The economy between the years 1946-1949 witnessed the growth of enterprises offering <a href="welfare" class="uri" title="wikilink">welfare</a> services to sustain workers <a href="standard_of_living" title="wikilink">standard of living</a> during the <a href="hyperinflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">hyperinflation</a> crisis that afflicted the KMT.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The KMT position was bleak. Chiang Kai Shek attempted to eliminate the CPC in the North by using troops belonging to northern warlords who had sided with Chiang during the Civil War and then switched sides to join the Japanese during the invasion. This strategy backfired as the effort to suppress the CPC who the peasants remembered as the enemies of the Japanese by using troops who had assisted the hated invaders further eroded any base of popular support which Chiang might have hoped for. Although the KMT had an advantage in their numbers and weapons, and benefited from considerable international support, their low morale hindered their ability to fight. Furthermore, though they administered a larger and more populous territory, their corruption effectively stifled any civilian support.</p>
<p>The CPC were ultimately able to seize Manchuria after struggling through numerous set-backs while trying to take the cities, with the decisive <a href="Liaoshen_Campaign" title="wikilink">Liaoshen Campaign</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The capture of large KMT formations provided them with the tanks, heavy artillery, and other combined-arms assets needed to prosecute offensive operations south of the Great Wall.

<h2 id="relationship-between-the-two-sides-since-1950">Relationship between the two sides since 1950</h2>

<p>Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a> in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President <a href="Harry_S._Truman" title="wikilink">Harry S. Truman</a> ordered the <a href="U.S._7th_Fleet" title="wikilink">U.S. 7th Fleet</a> into the <a href="Taiwan_strait" title="wikilink">Taiwan straits</a> to prevent ROC and PRC from attacking each other.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1949, the ROC declared a &quot;closure&quot; of all mainland ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of <a href="Min_River_(Fujian)" title="wikilink">Min river</a> in <a href="Fujian_province" title="wikilink">Fujian province</a> to the mouth of the <a href="Liao_River" title="wikilink">Liao river</a> in Manchuria.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Since the mainland's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland fishermen.</p>
<p>After losing the mainland, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to <a href="Burma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burma</a> and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, General <a href="Li_Mi_(ROC_general)" title="wikilink">Li Mi</a>, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of <a href="Yunnan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yunnan</a>. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.</p>
<p>After the Republic of China complained to the United Nations against the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> supporting the CPC, the <a href="UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_505" title="wikilink">UN General Assembly Resolution 505</a> was adopted on <a href="February_1" title="wikilink">February 1</a>, <a href="1952" class="uri" title="wikilink">1952</a> to condemn the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in <a href="Fujian_Province,_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Fujian</a> as vital for any future campaign to retake the mainland. On <a href="September_3" title="wikilink">September 3</a>, <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>, the <a href="First_Taiwan_Strait_crisis" title="wikilink">First Taiwan Strait crisis</a> began when the PLA started shelling <a href="Quemoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quemoy</a> and threatened to take the <a href="Dachen_Islands" title="wikilink">Dachen Islands</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> On <a href="January_20" title="wikilink">January 20</a>, <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>, the PLA took nearby <a href="Yijiangshan_Island" title="wikilink">Yijiangshan Island</a>, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island.

<p>The <a href="Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" title="wikilink">Second Taiwan Strait Crisis</a> began on <a href="August_23" title="wikilink">August 23</a>, <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a> with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of <a href="Quemoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quemoy</a> (by the PRC) and <a href="Xiamen" title="wikilink">Amoy</a> (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided <a href="Amphibious_warfare" title="wikilink">amphibious assault</a> ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a>, the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On <a href="October_25" title="wikilink">October 25</a>, the PRC announced an &quot;even-day ceasefire&quot; — the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days. The <a href="Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" title="wikilink">Third Taiwan Strait Crisis</a> in 1995–96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, there has been growing economic exchanges on both sides while the <a href="Taiwan_strait" title="wikilink">Taiwan straits</a> remain a dangerous flash point.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Beginning in the early 21st century, there has been a significant warming of relations between the <a href="KMT" class="uri" title="wikilink">KMT</a> and the <a href="Communist_Party_of_China" title="wikilink">Communist Party of China</a> with high level exchanges such as the <a href="2005_Pan-Blue_visits_to_mainland_China" title="wikilink">2005 Pan-blue visit</a>.</p>
