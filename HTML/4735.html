<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>While attending a Christian revival meeting, 19-year-old Christy Huddleson is fascinated when she listens to the founder of an Appalachian mission program as he describes the work his group is doing and the needs of the Cutter Gap community. Christy, the daughter of a well-to-do family in <a href="Asheville,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, finds herself drawn to the idea of volunteering for the mission to be a teacher to the needy Cutter Gap students. Her parents are initially reluctant, but she persists and soon makes the trip to the remote area. From her first day in the Appalachians, she is challenged by the filthy conditions and primitive <a href="folk_medicine" title="wikilink">folk medicine</a> beliefs of the mountain people, but her mentor at the mission, a <a href="Quaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quaker</a> named Alice Henderson, encourages her to notice also the beauty in the community and people, and to help preserve the best of the Appalachians in ways that will help the locals to become self-sustaining. Christy and her co-worker, minister David Grantland, attempt to educate local students and to teach their neighbors an alternative to the <a href="family_feud" title="wikilink">family feuding</a> and cycle of revenge that have been a tradition for decades. Local physician Neill MacNeill is an <a href="agnostic" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnostic</a> who grew up in the mountains and who seeks to make Christy more sympathetic to locals' concerns and traditions.</p>
<p>Plot threads include Christy's experiences in the school house and her burgeoning friendships with local women, David's challenges in reaching a community that views him as an interfering outsider, family feuds, moonshiners who use schoolchildren as their assistants, and questions of faith. As Christy becomes better acquainted with MacNeill and Miss Alice, she discovers that the physician's late wife was Miss Alice's daughter (conceived when a predatory visiting minister raped Alice as a teen), and that the physician's agnosticism was partly a reaction to the apparent injustice of his wife's death. Christy's faith is tried by these and other revelations, at the same time that she is romantically drawn both to the minister and the physician.</p>

<p>The fictional village of Cutter Gap is based on a community centered on <a href="Morgan_Branch,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Morgan Branch</a>, near <a href="Del_Rio,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Del Rio</a> in <a href="Cocke_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Cocke County, Tennessee</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Local landmarks associated with the story are marked for visitors, including the site of the Ebenezer Mission in the smaller nearby community of Chapel Hollow.</p>
<p>At a women's society meeting where Christy was giving a talk regarding the plight of those living in Cutter Gap, a woman shares with her information regarding the <a href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish</a> <a href="folk_high_school" title="wikilink">folk schools</a> established by <a href="N._F._S._Grundtvig" title="wikilink">Grundtvig</a>, in which adults learned to use traditional folkways and crafts to become self-sustaining.</p>
<p>A wholly fictional MacNeill performs <a href="trepanation" class="uri" title="wikilink">trepanation</a> on an accident victim and studies <a href="trachoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">trachoma</a> in the local population. Several characters also suffer from <a href="typhoid_fever" title="wikilink">typhoid fever</a>, and the educated characters in the book set out to teach better <a href="hygiene" class="uri" title="wikilink">hygiene</a> to the local population in order to prevent the disease. MacNeill also lectures Christy on the origins of <a href="moonshine" title="wikilink">moonshining</a> and the reasons why many locals — including MacNeill — consider its prohibition to be an unfair block to their earning money from their crops. Christy eventually marries the physician.</p>
<p>Catherine Marshall, the widow of Dr. Peter Marshall when she wrote the book, following up on her best seller &quot;A Man Called Peter,&quot; has been quoted as saying the book was about 75% percent historical, although the main characters (the physician) and mountain woman descended from ancient royalty, are fictionalized. While in the book it is implied she ends up with the doctor, the real &quot;Christy,&quot; Catherine Marshall's mother, married a minister.</p>
