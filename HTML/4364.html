<p><strong>Robin Friday</strong> (27 July 1952 â€“ 22 December 1990) was an English <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">footballer</a> who played professionally as a <a href="forward_(association_football)" title="wikilink">forward</a> for <a href="Reading_F.C." title="wikilink">Reading</a> and <a href="Cardiff_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Cardiff City</a> during a career that lasted four years in the mid-1970s. Born and raised in <a href="Acton,_London" title="wikilink">Acton</a>, west <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, Friday played for local semi-professional sides before joining <a href="Charlie_Hurley" title="wikilink">Charlie Hurley</a>'s <a href="Football_League_Fourth_Division" title="wikilink">Fourth Division</a> Reading team in 1974. Despite having just joined from <a href="non-League_football" title="wikilink">non-League football</a>, he quickly became a key player, and helped Reading to win <a href="promotion_and_relegation" title="wikilink">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Third Division</a> during the <a href="1975&lt;U+2013&gt;76_Football_League" title="wikilink">1975&lt;U+2013&gt;76</a> season.</p>
<p>Friday was known for smoking, drinking, womanising and drug-taking, and his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record. However, his on-field performances were regarded as excellent, and he won the club's player of the year award in both of his full seasons at Reading, as well as being the leading goal scorer.</p>
<p>As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip in the first half of the <a href="1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77_Football_League" title="wikilink">1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77</a> season, leading Reading to sell him to <a href="Football_League_Second_Division" title="wikilink">Second Division</a> side Cardiff City in December 1976. Friday travelled to join his new team by train, without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by Cardiff manager <a href="Jimmy_Andrews" title="wikilink">Jimmy Andrews</a> before even signing for the club. After a strong debut, his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field, including kicking <a href="Mark_Lawrenson" title="wikilink">Mark Lawrenson</a> in the face, Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a <a href="myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">heart attack</a>.</p>
<p>The strongest parts of Friday's game were his ball skills, footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength. Andrews labelled Friday &quot;the complete centre-forward&quot;, and, along with numerous contemporaries, retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England national team</a>. Both because of his playing ability and personality, Friday remains an important figure to fans of both Reading and Cardiff, despite his short career: in a <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> poll held in 2004, he was voted the top &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; for both clubs. He has been voted Reading's best ever player twice, in 1999 and 2007. Cardiff-based band <a href="Super_Furry_Animals" title="wikilink">Super Furry Animals</a> dedicated their 1996 single <em><a href="The_Man_Don&#39;t_Give_a_Fuck" title="wikilink">The Man Don't Give a Fuck</a></em> to his memory.</p>

<p><img src="Griffin_Park_1982_-_geograph-2023521.jpg" title="fig:The Friday brothers saw their first professional match at the age of two, at Brentford&#39;s Griffin Park ground, pictured in 1982." alt="The Friday brothers saw their first professional match at the age of two, at Brentford&#39;s Griffin Park ground, pictured in 1982." /> Robin Friday and his twin brother, Tony, were born in <a href="Acton,_London" title="wikilink">Acton</a>, west <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, on 27 July 1952. Their parents, Alf Friday, a driver for a laundry firm, and his wife Sheila, were both born in Acton and had married a year before, both aged 20, having met three years earlier. Sheila's father, Frederick Riding, had played professional football for <a href="Brentford_F.C." title="wikilink">Brentford</a> before the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. The Fridays lived with Sheila's family until moving into a <a href="Prefabricated_home" title="wikilink">prefab</a> of their own in <a href="Acton_Green,_London" title="wikilink">Acton Green</a> when Robin and Tony were aged two; they later moved to a <a href="maisonette" class="uri" title="wikilink">maisonette</a> in <a href="South_Acton,_London" title="wikilink">South Acton</a> in 1962 when it was found that the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having been remarkably close, rarely arguing or fighting; a notable difference was that Robin was shy, whereas Tony was more confident. The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two, when their father took them to a Brentford match at <a href="Griffin_Park" title="wikilink">Griffin Park</a>; from the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Around the age of ten, Robin possessed notable ball-skills, and according to his father could flick an orange up onto his neck, balance it and then let it roll it back down his body and catch it on his foot. As well as football, Robin played cricket to a high standard, boxed and played tennis. Despite their many similarities and common interest in sports and football in particular, the twins were wildly different in academic terms: while Tony did well at school, Robin was uninterested and according to his brother &quot;was always bunking off, having <a href="wiktionary:bird#Etymology_1" title="wikilink">birds</a> around the park.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Robin was scouted by numerous London sides during his teenage years, joining <a href="Crystal_Palace_F.C." title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a>'s school of excellence at 12 or 13, then moving on to <a href="Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C." title="wikilink">Queens Park Rangers</a> for a season at 13 and then to <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="wikilink">Chelsea</a>, with whom he attended the <a href="1967_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1967 FA Cup Final</a> as a youth player. However, Friday's individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him. The twin brothers joined a men's team, the Acton British Legion Reserves, aged 14, and in some matches would play alongside their father. Tony played in midfield, and Robin up front, but according to Tony his brother was even better as a goalkeeper than a forward: &quot;He was a brilliant goalkeeper. He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end.&quot; Around this time Robin became interested in music, dancing and attending concerts; he was a fan of <a href="Janis_Joplin" title="wikilink">Janis Joplin</a> in particular. He also had a talent for drawing, but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15. Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid-teens; he left school at 15, a year before Tony, and began training as a plasterer.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="borstal-first-marriage-and-the-isthmian-league">Borstal, first marriage and the Isthmian League</h3>
<p>Friday lasted two months as a plasterer before moving on to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back attitude and indifference was already clear: in his father's words, &quot;he didn't care&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be &quot;a car radio or something&quot;, he was released almost immediately because he suffered from <a href="asthma" class="uri" title="wikilink">asthma</a>; however, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to <a href="Feltham_(HM_Prison)" title="wikilink">Feltham Borstal</a>, where he served 14 months.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> During his time there, Friday became physically stronger and fitter and also starred for the borstal football team; he was selected for the prison league's all-star men's team, still aged 16, and was allowed out of borstal to train and play with <a href="Reading_F.C." title="wikilink">Reading</a>'s youth teams.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>After his release, Friday returned to Acton and met a local <a href="Black_British" title="wikilink">black</a> girl named Maxine Doughan, whom he made pregnant. The local controversy surrounding the <a href="Interracial_marriage" title="wikilink">interracial relationship</a> caused the couple and their circle of friends to be isolated socially, and even to be physically attacked one night in an Acton pub.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents &lt;U+2013&gt; Alf refused to even attend the wedding<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; they married, both aged 17.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A daughter, Nicola, was born soon afterwards but Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously, continuing to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A friend of Friday's, who played for <a href="Walthamstow_Avenue_F.C." title="wikilink">Walthamstow Avenue</a>, a semi-professional <a href="Isthmian_League" title="wikilink">Isthmian League</a> club from north-east London, took him along to training one day in early 1971; Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>10 per week. Many of his new team-mates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Friday made his d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against <a href="Bromley_F.C." title="wikilink">Bromley</a>, coming off the bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against <a href="Tooting_&amp;_Mitcham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Tooting &amp; Mitcham</a> he once again appeared as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club <a href="Hayes_F.C." title="wikilink">Hayes</a> in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Hayes offered &lt;U+00A3&gt;30 per week, and were also based closer to his home in Acton.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in <a href="Lambeth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lambeth</a>, a <a href="Hoist_(device)" title="wikilink">hoist</a> rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike &lt;U+2013&gt; the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes front line in October 1972.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>After scoring eight goals within a month of his return to action, scouts from <a href="The_Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> clubs reported back on Friday, but because of his age League managers were unsure that he could make it; at 20 years old many of them felt that he was already too old to start a professional career.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Friday was known at Hayes for his excessive drinking, and on one occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> his intoxication was obvious.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Nevertheless, he was sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Hayes were drawn to play <a href="Football_League_Fourth_Division" title="wikilink">Fourth Division</a> club Reading in the <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a>'s second round in early 1973; the team managed to draw 0&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at Reading and earn the right to a <a href="Replay_(sports)" title="wikilink">replay</a> at home, which they lost 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager <a href="Charlie_Hurley" title="wikilink">Charlie Hurley</a> was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch him play;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> having done his research on his background, he was cautious about signing Friday, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The <a href="1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73</a> season was Friday's most prolific non-League year in terms of goals.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Friday briefly joined <a href="Enfield_F.C." title="wikilink">Enfield</a> early in the <a href="1973&lt;U+2013&gt;74_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1973&lt;U+2013&gt;74</a> season and actually scored against Hayes in an FA Cup tie before returning to west London in December 1973;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> he was then signed by Hurley's Reading side in January 1974 for &lt;U+00A3&gt;750.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He had scored 46 goals in 67 appearances for Hayes over his two spells there,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> but during his three Isthmian League seasons had been sent off seven times.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>In Hurley's words, Friday &quot;trained like he played&quot;; &quot;he had no other way of playing&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> His new manager even had to take him out of training on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own team-mates in his effort to win.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Although he was now contracted to Reading, his amateurism meant that he could continue to appear for Hayes and work as an asphalter in London while training part-time and playing for Reading's reserves. By late January 1974, Reading were on a run of fourteen games with only two victories, while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches. Hurley had the amateur forward sign Football League forms on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-team d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but four days later.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Friday turned in a performance against <a href="Northampton_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Northampton Town</a> at <a href="Elm_Park_(stadium)" title="wikilink">Elm Park</a> that the <em><a href="Reading_Post" title="wikilink">Reading Evening Post</a></em> called &quot;outstanding&quot; as Reading drew 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The team then travelled to <a href="Barnsley_F.C." title="wikilink">Barnsley</a> on 3 February, having not won away from home in four months; after Barnsley led 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Reading immediately offered a professional contract, which Friday signed on 6 February 1974.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Friday's technical ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike; the <em>Reading Evening Post</em> report of Reading's 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over <a href="Exeter_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Exeter City</a> on 10 February 1974, Friday's first match as a professional, described his performance as &quot;sheer magic&quot; as he scored twice.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The report also called Friday's first goal of the day &quot;glorious&quot;: he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner from the edge of the penalty area.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing <a href="Shin_guard" title="wikilink">shin pads</a>, and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> After sustaining a calf injury against Exeter, he returned for the team's next game, away at <a href="Lincoln_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Lincoln City</a> on 17 February. Friday was repeatedly fouled cynically by the opposing players and sustained injuries necessitating five minutes on the sideline late in the first half; however, he recovered, returned to the game and set up both Reading goals as his side prevailed by a score of two goals to nil.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The team's next game, on 24 February 1974, was at home against <a href="Doncaster_Rovers_F.C." title="wikilink">Doncaster Rovers</a>, and with Friday playing a key role Reading won 5&lt;U+2013&gt;0. In particular, Friday scored a goal after 17 minutes described by the <em>Evening Post</em> reporter as &quot;magical&quot;:<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> With the score 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 to Reading, Friday received the ball near the edge of the penalty area, at a tight angle, and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low across goal, towards the far post. Although it appeared to be heading yards wide of the net, the ball suddenly curved in at the last possible moment &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;right around the goalie&quot;, in the words of Reading F.C. historian David Downs &lt;U+2013&gt; and clipped the goalpost before nestling in the back of the net.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his team-mates; most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender <a href="Tommy_Youlden" title="wikilink">Tommy Youlden</a>, were sceptical.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He drank extremely heavily, favouring American <a href="Colt_45_(malt_liquor)" title="wikilink">Colt 45</a> lager,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him; for example, Friday was barred from <a href="Caversham,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Caversham</a>'s Crown pub after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The Boar's Head in <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a> also banned him on ten separate occasions.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and <a href="Hobnail_(footwear)" title="wikilink">hobnail boots</a>, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Although Churchill's, described by Lewington as &quot;the worst club that has ever been in Reading&quot;, tolerated such behaviour,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called &quot;the elephant&quot; which consisted of turning the pockets of his jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He and his friends would regularly drink all day,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> However, he would play his prized <a href="Heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take <a href="Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="wikilink">LSD</a> with casual indifference.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail:<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a> sides <a href="Sheffield_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a>;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> the former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Although United had by this time sent scouts to see Friday six times<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and Arsenal manager <a href="Bertie_Mee" title="wikilink">Bertie Mee</a> had personally attended Reading's 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 home win over <a href="Rotherham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Rotherham United</a> on 12 September,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> no approach came from either team. After Reading despatched <a href="Newport_County_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Newport County</a> 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 on 14 September 1974, Friday and forward partner <a href="Dick_Habbin" title="wikilink">Dick Habbin</a> had scored six goals each and topped the Football League goalscoring charts.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> However, at the same time Friday's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the <em>Evening Post</em>, usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first <a href="hat-trick" class="uri" title="wikilink">hat-trick</a> for Reading in a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over <a href="Southport_F.C." title="wikilink">Southport</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Although he was the Football League's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, he had also already been booked three times that season and the <em>Post</em> argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension; the article argued that missing games because of &quot;completely unnecessary&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; fouls amounted to selling the club short.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave, intending to place them beside club chairman Frank Waller, who was sleeping on the coach. When he returned, however, Hurley sternly told him that &quot;you must never ever desecrate a graveyard&quot;, causing the forward to obediently return the statues.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> On another occasion he reacted to the news that a team-mate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in; later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>After Reading went four games without a win starting on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, in a home match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from <a href="Stewart_Henderson" title="wikilink">Stewart Henderson</a> and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. &quot;One is increasingly under the impression,&quot; the <em>Evening Post</em> reported, &quot;that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up.

As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd. &quot;I'll never forget it,&quot; Thomas recalled, &quot;It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ...

<p>Friday's style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as &quot;absolutely fabulous&quot;,<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his team-mates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday &quot;the complete centre-forward&quot; and placed him on a par with <a href="Alan_Shearer" title="wikilink">Alan Shearer</a>,<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England,<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as <a href="John_Aldridge" title="wikilink">John Aldridge</a> and <a href="Dean_Saunders" title="wikilink">Dean Saunders</a>.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> This attitude was also held by Hamilton and Friday's Reading team-mate <a href="John_Murray_(English_footballer)" title="wikilink">John Murray</a>, both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he &quot;sorted his head out&quot;, in Hamilton's words.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> A natural goalscoring forward, Friday was also unselfish and would take just as much pleasure out of setting up a goal scored by a team-mate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined with all of this to create a formidable forward player &lt;U+2013&gt; such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading into one of the division's best sides in a matter of weeks.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: &quot;It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin's era would have read&quot;, he wrote; &quot;He was a ready-made star&quot;.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as &quot;really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'.&quot; On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a team-mate.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> &quot;We didn't need anyone else up front,&quot; Hurley later said; &quot;they couldn't get the ball off him. He was one of those guys who could beat five players easily.&quot;<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Andrews agreed: &quot;once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him.&quot;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<p>Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances; Downs's opinion was that Friday &quot;worked as hard at the end of the game as he did at the start&quot; while Hurley said that Friday would often become furious at his team-mates for not trying their best, even in training.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a &quot;villain&quot;.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle with their testicles. Cardiff team-mate <a href="Paul_Went" title="wikilink">Paul Went</a> recalled that these tricks would often &quot;completely <a href="wiktionary:throw#Etymology_1" title="wikilink">throw</a>&quot; defenders and affect their concentration.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: &quot;On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a winner&quot;.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a><a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>
