<p><strong><em>Tales of Monkey Island</em></strong> is a 2009 <a href="graphic_adventure_game" title="wikilink">graphic adventure</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> developed by <a href="Telltale_Games" title="wikilink">Telltale Games</a> and <a href="LucasArts" class="uri" title="wikilink">LucasArts</a>. It is the fifth game in the <em><a href="Monkey_Island_(series)" title="wikilink">Monkey Island</a></em> series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, <em><a href="Escape_from_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em>. Developed for <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Windows</a> and the <a href="Wii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wii</a> console, the game was released in five <a href="episodic_video_game" title="wikilink">episodic</a> segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was <a href="Digital_distribution" title="wikilink">digitally distributed</a> through <a href="WiiWare" class="uri" title="wikilink">WiiWare</a> and Telltale's own website, and later through <a href="Steam_(software)" title="wikilink">Steam</a> and <a href="Amazon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amazon.com</a>. Ports for <a href="Mac_OS_X" title="wikilink">Mac OS X</a>, the <a href="PlayStation_Network" title="wikilink">PlayStation Network</a> and the <a href="iPad" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPad</a> were released several months after the series ended.</p>
<p>Players assume the role of <a href="Golden_Age_of_Piracy" title="wikilink">pirate</a> <a href="Guybrush_Threepwood" title="wikilink">Guybrush Threepwood</a>, who&lt;U+2014&gt;while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate <a href="LeChuck" class="uri" title="wikilink">LeChuck</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;accidentally releases a <a href="hoodoo_(folk_magic)" title="wikilink">voodoo</a> pox across the <a href="Gulf_of_Melange" title="wikilink">Gulf of Melange</a>. With the assistance of his wife, <a href="Elaine_Marley" title="wikilink">Elaine </a>, Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' <a href="Video_game_remake" title="wikilink">special edition</a> of the 1990 title <em><a href="The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em>; LucasArts oversaw production of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator <a href="Ron_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Ron Gilbert</a> was involved in project planning, while development was led by <a href="Dave_Grossman_(game_developer)" title="wikilink">Dave Grossman</a>, who co-designed the first two <em>Monkey Island</em> games. The game's music was composed by <a href="Michael_Land" title="wikilink">Michael Land</a>, and the core cast of <em><a href="The_Curse_of_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">The Curse of Monkey Island</a></em> reprised their voice roles.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; <a href="1UP.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">1UP.com</a> described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> garnered several industry awards, and is Telltale's most commercially successful project to date.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is a <a href="graphic_adventure_game" title="wikilink">graphic adventure game</a>; the player assumes the role of the protagonist in an <a href="interactive_story" title="wikilink">interactive story</a>, which is driven by the exploration of the game's <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">three-dimensional</a> (3D) environments and by solving puzzles.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These puzzles are traditional adventure game conundrums that require the player to use the environment, or items that have been found and stored inside the game's inventory, to accomplish goals.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In keeping with previous <em><a href="Monkey_Island_(series)" title="wikilink">Monkey Island</a></em> games, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> allows players to combine certain items to create new items;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> for instance, the player can combine a number of voodoo ingredients with a cutlass to produce a magical cutlass.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The game world is explored with a <a href="Personal_computer" title="wikilink">PC</a> keyboard and mouse, or the <a href="Wii_Nunchuk" title="wikilink">Wii Nunchuk</a>'s <a href="analog_stick" title="wikilink">analog stick</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Contrary to previous Telltale adventure games, the player holds and drags the mouse to move Guybrush, rather than <a href="point-and-click" title="wikilink">pointing and clicking</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The <a href="Arrow_keys#WASD_keys" title="wikilink">WASD keys</a> or the arrow keys may instead be used to move Guybrush. Like other <em>Monkey Island</em> games, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is designed to prevent the player from meeting a dead-end, such as the death of the player character.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Each of the game's chapters is an estimated two to four hours in length, depending on the player's ability to solve the puzzles.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A hint system can assist struggling players.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The first chapter of the game includes a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; mode,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> where the player directs Guybrush through a maze-like jungle in pursuit of hidden treasure. Found treasures translate into prizes and discounts on Telltale's website. To access this mode, the player must locate maps on the Internet, hidden on the official Telltale website and three participating <em>Monkey Island</em> fansites.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="setting-and-characters">Setting and characters</h3>

<p><em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is set several years after the events of <em><a href="Escape_from_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The designers discarded the <a href="Tri-Island_Area" title="wikilink">Tri-Island Area</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the setting of the game's predecessors&lt;U+2014&gt;in favor of a new locale: the <a href="Gulf_of_Melange" title="wikilink">Gulf of Melange</a>. The game follows <a href="Guybrush_Threepwood" title="wikilink">Guybrush Threepwood</a> (voiced by <a href="Dominic_Armato" title="wikilink">Dominic Armato</a>),<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> a pirate who is na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve and hapless, yet successful. Before the game's beginning, Guybrush spends years locating the elements needed to create the Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu, a <a href="Hoodoo_(folk_magic)" title="wikilink">voodoo</a> weapon capable of destroying his arch-nemesis, the demon pirate <a href="LeChuck" class="uri" title="wikilink">LeChuck</a> (voiced by Adam Harrington,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Kevin Blackton and later <a href="Earl_Boen" title="wikilink">Earl Boen</a>).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As with other <em>Monkey Island</em> games, LeChuck vies for the love of <a href="Elaine_Marley" title="wikilink">Elaine Marley-Threepwood</a> (voiced by <a href="Alexandra_Boyd" title="wikilink">Alexandra Boyd</a>),<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> the wife of Guybrush Threepwood and former governor of the Tri-Island Area. In the events immediately before the game, LeChuck kidnaps Elaine. Guybrush pursues LeChuck with the voodoo cutlass.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Several ancillary characters from earlier games in the series return in <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, including the <a href="World_of_Monkey_Island#Secondary_characters" title="wikilink">Voodoo Lady</a> (voiced by Alison Ewing),<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> an enigmatic <a href="Haitian_Vodou" title="wikilink">voodoo priestess</a> who advises Guybrush in his quests; <a href="Stan_(Monkey_Island)" title="wikilink">Stan</a> (voiced by Gavin Hammon),<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> a stereotypical salesman and business opportunist; and <a href="World_of_Monkey_Island#Ancillary_characters" title="wikilink">Murray</a> (voiced by <a href="Denny_Delk" title="wikilink">Denny Delk</a>),<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> a talking skull with delusions of grandeur. The game introduces new characters to the series, such as Morgan LeFlay (voiced by Nicki Rapp),<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> a competent and athletic female <a href="bounty_hunter" title="wikilink">bounty hunter</a> who idolizes Guybrush. Other additions to the cast include Coronado DeCava, an explorer and former lover of the Voodoo Lady (voiced by <a href="Kid_Beyond" title="wikilink">Andrew Chaikin</a>), and the Marquis de Singe (voiced by <a href="Jared_Emerson-Johnson" title="wikilink">Jared Emerson-Johnson</a>), an antagonistic French nobleman and doctor.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>
<p>Having acquired the components of the Cutlass of Kaflu, Guybrush races to the <a href="Rock_of_Gelato" title="wikilink">Rock of Gelato</a> to save his wife from LeChuck; however, he fails to properly create the sword. When Guybrush stabs LeChuck, the flawed cutlass transforms LeChuck into a human, and infects Guybrush's hand with the &quot;Pox of LeChuck&quot;, which gives the hand a mind of its own. An explosion on the ship hurls Guybrush into the ocean, and he later washes up on <a href="Flotsam_Island" title="wikilink">Flotsam Island</a>. There, Guybrush encounters the Voodoo Lady, who explains that the pox will ravage the Caribbean, unless it is absorbed by a voodoo <a href="sponge" title="wikilink">sea sponge</a> called &quot;<em>La Esponja Grande</em>&quot; (The Big Sponge). Guybrush is advised to seek DeCava, who is on an expedition to find <em>La Esponja Grande</em>; however, to leave the island, Guybrush must neutralize a machine that is drawing the winds inward, and thereby preventing ships from leaving. It is revealed that the Marquis de Singe is using the machine to bring pirates to the island for his medical experiments. De Singe becomes obsessed with Guybrush's hand, as he believes it to be key to eternal life. Guybrush reverts the wind patterns to normal&lt;U+2014&gt;unwittingly causing the pox to spread across the sea&lt;U+2014&gt;and departs in his newly acquired ship, the <em>Screaming Narwhal</em>. De Singe hires Morgan LeFlay to capture Guybrush; en route to the <a href="Jerkbait_Islands" title="wikilink">Jerkbait Islands</a>, she boards the <em>Screaming Narwhal</em> and cuts off Guybrush's pox-infected hand in a duel. Afterwards, she returns it to de Singe.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>On the Jerkbait Islands, Guybrush finds Elaine safe, and learns that the now-human LeChuck is trying to make up for the evil deeds of his past. The three help to defend the resident <a href="mermaid" title="wikilink">merfolk</a> city from pox-infected pirates; in return, the merfolk summon sea creatures to assist Guybrush in locating <em>La Esponja Grande</em>. Elaine stays behind to monitor LeChuck's actions. As Guybrush follows the creatures on the <em>Screaming Narwhal</em>, Morgan again boards the ship; de Singe had informed her that Guybrush's entire body was needed. Distracted by their duel, neither can react in time when the <em>Screaming Narwhal</em> is swallowed whole by a giant <a href="manatee" class="uri" title="wikilink">manatee</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Inside the manatee, Guybrush and LeFlay discover DeCava and his crew; Guybrush heals the manatee's injuries, and escapes with DeCava to the location of <em>La Esponja Grande</em>. After retrieving <em>La Esponja Grande</em>, Morgan knocks Guybrush unconscious and sets sail for Flotsam Island with her bounty.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>As Morgan reluctantly delivers Guybrush to de Singe, Guybrush is seized by the townspeople and put on trial for having released the pox across the Gulf of Melange. LeChuck exonerates Guybrush by implicating himself in the creation of the pox, and produces evidence that all previous confrontations between Guybrush and LeChuck had been orchestrated by the Voodoo Lady; the two are imprisoned, and Guybrush is released. As Guybrush prepares to cure the pox with <em>La Esponja Grande</em>, he finds Morgan murdered in de Singe's laboratory. At the wind machine, de Singe traps Guybrush and Elaine, and believes that his experiments with Guybrush's hand are on the verge of granting him immortality. However, de Singe falls into the wind machine and is disintegrated; Guybrush then uses <em>La Esponja Grande</em> to absorb the pox. LeChuck arrives to free the two, but as Guybrush thanks him, LeChuck impales him on the Cutlass of Kaflu, and uses <em>La Esponja Grande</em> to transfer the pox's potency to himself.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Now deceased, Guybrush finds his spiritual self at the <a href="Crossroads_(culture)#Spirituality" title="wikilink">crossroads</a>: the place where the living and dead realms meet. With the assistance of Morgan's spirit, he finds a spell that embodies courage, anchor, direction and sacrifice, and returns to the land of the living as a ghost. However, LeChuck absorbs the massive amount of energy generated by a dimensional rift Guybrush opens; the pox was engineered by LeChuck to achieve this goal. Elaine, in an apparent act of betrayal, becomes LeChuck's demon bride. Guybrush repossesses his dead body and shrinks <em>La Esponja Grande</em>, reversing LeChuck's hold over Elaine. LeChuck attacks Guybrush, who lures the demon pirate into the rift. There, LeChuck is simultaneously stabbed by Elaine and Morgan, which destroys his physical and spiritual forms. Stranded alone at the crossroads, Guybrush realizes that he has one more item that meets the spell's criteria for his return: Elaine's wedding ring. He uses it to restore himself to life and return to his wife. The spirit of Morgan delivers a jar containing the essence of LeChuck to the Voodoo Lady, in exchange for her return to the land of the living.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Telltale Games had been founded by former LucasArts employees in the wake of the 2004 cancellation of <em><a href="Sam_&amp;_Max:_Freelance_Police" title="wikilink">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em>.

<p>Following hints by Telltale Games that they would soon announce a major new series,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> was unveiled at the June 2009 <a href="Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. Its roughly 50 person development team was headed by Dave Grossman,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> who co-designed the first two <em>Monkey Island</em> games. <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em> and <em><a href="Sam_&amp;_Max_Hit_the_Road" title="wikilink">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a></em> co-designer Michael Stemmle contributed design and story writing, in collaboration with Mark Darin and Sean Vanaman.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Series creator <a href="Ron_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Ron Gilbert</a> was involved in brainstorm sessions for the game, but did not have a large role in its development; however, the development team asserted that Gilbert's &quot;thumbprints are all over [the game]&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> counterparts a LucasArts-developed <a href="enhanced_remake" title="wikilink">enhanced remake</a> of <em><a href="The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> On his blog, Gilbert wrote that he was &quot;very excited&quot; for both Telltale's adaptation and LucasArts' reimagining of the original game, and stated that &quot;it's strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of its own&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>While Gilbert and Grossman were engaged in the development of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, the third co-designer of the original two games, <a href="Tim_Schafer" title="wikilink">Tim Schafer</a>, was not associated with the project.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Grossman said that Gilbert's leadership role at <a href="Hothead_Games" title="wikilink">Hothead Games</a> had made procuring his assistance &quot;legal wrangling&quot;, and that including Schafer as well would have been too much trouble.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Schafer later said that he was &quot;really happy&quot; for the new game, and that the project was in good hands under Grossman's lead.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The game's limited-edition slipcover artwork was painted by <em>Sam &amp; Max</em> creator <a href="Steve_Purcell" title="wikilink">Steve Purcell</a>, who was responsible for the box art of both <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> and <em><a href="Monkey_Island_2:_LeChuck&#39;s_Revenge" title="wikilink">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Purcell created three different rough covers to present to Telltale Games, though the company valued Purcell's own opinion on which was best. Having not been satisfied with Elaine's appearance on the cover of <em>The Secret for Monkey Island</em>, Purcell was keen to have another attempt to portray the character in his artwork.

<p>As with Telltale's other products, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> was developed and released in five <a href="episodic_video_game" title="wikilink">episodic</a> segments; Grossman explained that Telltale prefers to tell stories this way, rather than as continuous narratives that are too long for people to play comfortably.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> However, unlike their previous games, each episode is not a standalone tale; it is a single chapter in a larger plot.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This allowed Telltale to advance the story like that of a television series, in which character relationships develop in the minds of the audience over several months.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Each episode is designed to be gratifying on its own, with a satisfying conclusion; however, it then provides a cliffhanger to &quot;tantalize the player a little more&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> According to Grossman, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is set after an &quot;imaginary&quot; <em>Monkey Island 5</em>, which he views as &quot;a blockbuster, epic 40-hour gigantic experience like the earlier games&quot;. Its story would have followed Guybrush's actions in the time between <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em> and <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>; the beginning of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> would have marked its conclusion.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Grossman maintained that both the story and gameplay of <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> were designed to be accessible for newcomers to the series, and commented that &quot;knowledge of the characters and their history will add a nostalgic layer to the sly references, but is by no means necessary&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Stemmle likened the game's episodic development to a relay race, and the development of a full game, such as <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, to a &quot;marathon&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This production method meant that certain aspects, such as the game's graphics, were worked on until the release deadline.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Each episode took around four months to complete.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Only a few environmental resources were reused between episodes; while Telltale Games had built previous games such as <em><a href="Sam_&amp;_Max_Save_the_World" title="wikilink">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</a></em> and <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures</em> around one set of locations, using the protagonists' homes and nearby streets consistently in each episode, the developers forwent such central hubs and &quot;comfort zones&quot; in <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, instead having each episode move off to a new primary location, only occasionally revisiting past locations.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> However, reusable <a href="skeletal_animation" title="wikilink">skeletons and animations</a> were developed for the supporting cast, including generic body types that could be visually altered to suit each character. While four of these were created, size constraints resulted in only two being included in the final game. By the game's third episode, Telltale became unsatisfied with this system, and began diversifying facial features, and providing supporting characters with unique silhouettes and animations.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>The game's artistic direction was developed by former LucasArts members Derek Sakai and Dave Bogan;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> both of them had worked on <em><a href="The_Curse_of_Monkey_Island" title="wikilink">The Curse of Monkey Island</a></em>, <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, and several earlier <a href="LucasArts_adventure_games" title="wikilink">LucasArts adventure games</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The game's final art direction was an attempt to combine the realistic look of the first two <em>Monkey Island</em> games with the whimsical, stylized graphics of the third.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> While those games feature entirely <a href="2D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">two-dimensional graphics</a>, and their successor, <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, is largely <a href="Pre-rendering" title="wikilink">pre-rendered</a>, <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> is rendered in full <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">3D</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Grossman explained that both Telltale's art department and <a href="game_engine" title="wikilink">game engine</a> are oriented toward 3D graphics development, and that the company enjoys the benefits 3D offers in the areas of animation and cinematography.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Improved capacity for the latter resulted in the appointment of a &quot;cinematic director&quot;: someone to help the designers locate scenes needing more dramatic acivity, and to assist the animators and choreographers in creating it. During development, the necessity of this position was highlighted by a ship battle scene in &quot;Launch of the <em>Screaming Narwhal</em>&quot;, which was initially static and unexciting. This was remedied by changing the time of day from dusk to night, adding rain and other weather effects, and using camera movement to simulate rough waters.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding the puzzle design in <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, Stemmle said that he and his fellow designers&lt;U+2014&gt;when they were younger&lt;U+2014&gt;believed that they needed to &quot;stump the player&quot;; however, Stemmle now considers it &quot;a <em>lot</em> better to make the players feel smart&quot;. Therefore, the designers included a hint system to prevent players from becoming stuck.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Grossman explained that Telltale's designers would bear in mind how players would mentally progress through the puzzles, and consider &quot;what realisations we expected them to have and whether those expectations are realistic&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Due to a tight development schedule, puzzles in the first episode were not optimized for the game's control system, which was re-designed late in development.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Initially, the game was to feature <a href="point-and-click" class="uri" title="wikilink">point-and-click</a> controls, as had been used in the majority of Telltale's previous games.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> However, a &quot;direct control&quot; method&lt;U+2014&gt;similar to the one seen in <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Adventures</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;was decided upon after much of the first episode had been planned. As the direct control in that game had been designed for an Xbox controller, the developers reworked the idea into a &quot;click-and-drag&quot; mouse system for <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>. Telltale believed that this control method made for a less passive and more engaging player experience, and provided more freedom for cinematic camera work than was possible with point-and-click.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Aside from providing the <em>Monkey Island</em> license to Telltale, LucasArts' role in the game's development involved collaboration and approval of the game's script, character concept art and puzzle design. As the remake of <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> had begun development before <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em>, LucasArts shared their art style guide with Telltale, so that the two products' art direction would be similar.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In particular, LucasArts wished that the character of Guybrush would be comparable to the appearance of the character in the special edition. LucasArts largely based their vision for Guybrush's new visuals in <em>Tales of Monkey Island</em> on how the character appeared in <em>The Curse of Monkey Island</em>, integrating various aspects from <em>LeChuck's Revenge</em> that commonly resonated through fan art, such as the character's blue coat and beard, in addition to using their own stylized art direction.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Telltale concept artist Ryan Jones worked closely with LucasArts' Jeff Sengalli on developing the appearance of Guybrush and other characters, Sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes, facial features and clothing.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Vanaman noted that LucasArts was open to Telltale's creative direction for the game, and did not &quot;put their foot down&quot; over any aspects of their vision.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
