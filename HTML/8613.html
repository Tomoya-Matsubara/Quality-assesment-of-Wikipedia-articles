<p>&quot;<strong>Jihad</strong>&quot; is a song by the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slayer</a>, and appears on their 2006 album <em><a href="Christ_Illusion" title="wikilink">Christ Illusion</a></em>. The track portrays the imagined viewpoint of a terrorist who has participated in the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, concluding with spoken lyrics taken from words left behind by <a href="Mohammed_Atta" title="wikilink">Mohammed Atta</a>; Atta was named by the FBI as the &quot;head suicide terrorist&quot; of the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center. &quot;Jihad&quot; was primarily written by guitarist <a href="Jeff_Hanneman" title="wikilink">Jeff Hanneman</a>; the lyrics were co-authored with vocalist <a href="Tom_Araya" title="wikilink">Tom Araya</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Jihad&quot; received a mixed reception in the music press, and reviews generally focused on the lyrics' controversial subject matter. The song drew comparisons to Slayer's 1986 track &quot;<a href="Angel_of_Death_(song)" title="wikilink">Angel of Death</a>—also penned by Hanneman—which similarly caused outrage at the time of its release.</p>
<p>Joseph Dias of the <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a> Christian group &quot;Catholic Secular Forum&quot; expressed concern over &quot;Jihad&quot;'s lyrics, and contributed to <em>Christ Illusion</em>'s recall by <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a> India, who to date have no plans for a reissue in that country. <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC-TV</a>'s Broadcast Standards and Practices Department censored the song during Slayer's first US network television appearance on <em><a href="Jimmy_Kimmel_Live" title="wikilink">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>.</em> Only the opening minute was broadcast over the show's credits, thus omitting 40% of the lyrics.</p>

<p>Guitarist <a href="Kerry_King" title="wikilink">Kerry King</a> has been outspoken in his defense of &quot;Jihad&quot;, and has claimed that the song has the &quot;coolest angle&quot; on <em>Christ Illusion</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> &quot;These new songs aren't political at all,&quot; King states, &quot;'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' &lt;U+2014&gt; it's what's spewing out at us from the TV.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> They did not wish to dwell on the topic &quot;because every band on the planet already has&quot; and &quot;came from a certain perspective&quot;, so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> &quot;We're Slayer, we have to be different&quot; was King's assertion.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>American singer/songwriter <a href="Steve_Earle" title="wikilink">Steve Earle</a> attempted a similar concept in penning &quot;John Walker's Blues&quot; (from the 2002 album <em><a href="Jerusalem_(album)" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a></em>), written from the perspective of the <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington</a>-born <a href="John_Walker_Lindh" title="wikilink">John Walker Lindh</a>, a <a href="Taliban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taliban</a> member captured during the 2001 US-led <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">invasion of Afghanistan</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Earle was criticised for this track; King anticipated a comparable reaction to &quot;Jihad&quot;:<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> &quot;People make an assumption before they (read) the lyrics.

<p><a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> reviewer Andy Patrizio was dismissive of the song's musical structure in comparison to other tracks on <em>Christ Illusion</em>: &quot;'Jihad,' 'Flesh Storm,' 'Skeleton Christ,' 'Supremist,' and felt there was too much similarity in the riffs, tuning, <a href="tempos" class="uri" title="wikilink">tempos</a>, and <a href="arrangements" class="uri" title="wikilink">arrangements</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="MusicOMH.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">MusicOMH.com</a>'s Ian Robinson was also negative, remarking that the song &quot;concludes with the 'now getting slightly old hat' Slayer trick (but still atmospheric) of over sampling voices over the solo.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception-and-criticism">Reception and criticism</h2>
<p>&quot;Jihad&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;alongside fellow <em><a href="Christ_Illusion" title="wikilink">Christ Illusion</a></em> album tracks &quot;<a href="Eyes_of_the_Insane" title="wikilink">Eyes of the Insane</a>&quot; and &quot;Cult&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;was made available for streaming on <a href="June_26" title="wikilink">June 26</a>, <a href="2006_in_music" title="wikilink">2006</a>, via the <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> website <em>Rafabasa.com</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The album was Slayer's ninth <a href="studio_album" title="wikilink">studio recording</a>, and was released on <a href="August_8" title="wikilink">August 8</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>. During reviews &quot;Jihad&quot; received a mixed reception.</p>
<p><em><a href="Blabbermouth.net" title="wikilink">Blabbermouth</a></em>'s Don Kaye gave the opinion that &quot;a handful of songs&quot; on <em>Christ Illusion</em> &quot;are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well&quot;, and specifically singled out the track: &quot;I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Ben Ratliff of <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> remarked that the song is &quot;predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than <a href="Martin_Amis" title="wikilink">Martin Amis</a>'s recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Peter Atkinson of <em>KNAC.com</em> was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as:<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of <em><a href="All_Music_Guide" title="wikilink">All Music Guide</a></em> observed that &quot;the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <em><a href="Austin_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Austin Chronicle</a></em>'s Marc Savlov asked readers to &quot;listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in &quot;Jihad,&quot; with Araya essaying the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>King would have appointed &quot;Jihad&quot; as the group's nomination in the &quot;<a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance" title="wikilink">Best Metal Performance</a>&quot; award category at the <a href="49th_Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">49th Grammy Awards</a>, deeming the chosen track &quot;<a href="Eyes_of_the_Insane" title="wikilink">Eyes of the Insane</a>&quot; &quot;the poorest representations&quot; of the group on ninth studio album <em>Christ Illusion</em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Despite King's statement, &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; won Slayer their first Grammy award.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Slayer guitarist has also stated; &quot;I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so you can hear the fans go crazy about it and you can't always here that at the beginning of a song.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="controversy">Controversy</h3>



<p>&quot;Jihad&quot;'s lyrical matter provoked controversy from several quarters. Peter Atkinson of <em>KNAC.com</em> remarked that the song &quot;no doubt will be <em>Christ Illusion</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s most controversial track&lt;U+2014&gt;especially if some flag-waving <a href="Fox_News_Channel" title="wikilink">Fox News</a> dipshit like <a href="Bill_O&#39;Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a> or <a href="Sean_Hannity" title="wikilink">Sean Hannity</a> gets clued in.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In May 2006, <em>World Entertainment News Network</em> announced that revelations of the song's lyrical content had angered the families of <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">9/11</a> victims.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group &quot;Catholic Secular Forum&quot; (CSF) issued a memorandum to his police commissioner, in which he expressed concern that &quot;Jihad&quot; would offend &quot;the sensibilities of the <a href="Muslim" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>...and secular Indians who have respect for all faiths.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> EMI India met with the CSF, apologising for the album's release, and recalled all copies, with no plans for a reissue.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> On <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, it was announced all stocks had been destroyed.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The track, alongside the album's controversial <a href="Larry_Carroll_(artist)" title="wikilink">Larry Carroll</a> painted cover art and provocative lyrics, were the specific reasons for EMI India's decision.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Araya had expected &quot;Jihad&quot;'s treatment of the events of 9/11 to create a backlash in America,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> however it failed to materialise. This was in part, he believes, because of peoples' view that the song was merely &quot;Slayer being Slayer&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Hanneman expected that the Muslim community would either &quot;embrace&quot; or hate Slayer for penning the track, or that the victims of 9/11 would criticize the band over the song's subject matter.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Jihad&quot; was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on <a href="ABC-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABC-TV</a>'s <em><a href="Jimmy_Kimmel_Live" title="wikilink">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a></em> (<a href="January_19" title="wikilink">January 19</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>), although only the opening minute of the track was broadcast.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> ABC-TV's Broadcast Standards and Practices department <a href="censorship" title="wikilink">censored</a> &quot;Jihad&quot;, and approached Slayer the day prior to broadcast with roughly 40% of the song lyrics deleted.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> King has since confirmed that the group were ten minutes from withdrawing from the show, but eventually decided to &quot;just go do it.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
