<p>The <strong>Gibraltar Artificial Reef</strong>, or simply the <strong>Gibraltar Reef</strong> is the ongoing <a href="artificial_reef" title="wikilink">artificial reef</a> project for the <a href="Mediterranean_sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean waters</a> surrounding the <a href="British_overseas_territories" title="wikilink">British overseas territory</a> of <a href="Gibraltar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gibraltar</a>. The initiative was started in 1973 by Dr. Eric Shaw of the <a href="Helping_Hand_Trust" title="wikilink">Helping Hand Trust</a>.</p>
<p>It consists of a collection of <a href="shipwreck" title="wikilink">sunken wrecks</a> designed to give <a href="marine_biology" title="wikilink">marine wildlife</a> an environment to breed and colonise.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Initially experiments were tried with <a href="tire" title="wikilink">tyres</a> chained together but sand movement and currents proved to be too strong and washed the tyres away or buried them. Benthic stones were used but they also suffered from <a href="tidal_force" title="wikilink">tidal force</a> and proved too expensive. This was followed by sinking of <a href="automobile" title="wikilink">cars</a> and monitoring the effects of sealife upon them, including a <a href="Mercedes-Benz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercedes-Benz</a> that was towed out behind a <a href="boat" class="uri" title="wikilink">boat</a> prior to being sunk, driven by diver and instructor <a href="Steven_Hensaw" title="wikilink">Steven Hensaw</a>.</p>
<p>Finally boats and <a href="barge" title="wikilink">barges</a> were to be donated by the <a href="Gibraltar_Port_Authority" title="wikilink">Gibraltar Port Authority</a> and local <a href="marina" title="wikilink">marinas</a>. These boats were thoroughly cleaned and emptied of all <a href="pollutant" title="wikilink">pollutants</a> prior to sinking and every location mapped. The first boats were two barges donated by <em><a href="Gibunco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gibunco</a></em> in 1974 and sunk in <a href="Camp_Bay" title="wikilink">Camp Bay</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 the 65 ton wooden boat &quot;True Joy&quot; also known as &lt;U+201C&gt;Noah&lt;U+2019&gt;s Ark&lt;U+201D&gt;, was sunk here.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The last major addition was the remains of the <em><a href="MV_New_Flame" title="wikilink">MV New Flame</a></em>, a mid-sized bulk carrier that foundered off <a href="Europa_Point" title="wikilink">Europa Point</a> in 2007.</p>
<p>In 2013 the reef was extended by the sinking of concrete blocks. This caused a diplomatic row, as Spain claimed that these blocks were ripping fishing nets and began discussions of whether to place a tax on visitors into Gibraltar from Spain, and close Spain's aerospace for flights inbound to Gibraltar.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibraltar's <a href="reef" class="uri" title="wikilink">reef</a> has become a major attraction for both local and Spanish recreational <a href="underwater_diving" title="wikilink">divers</a>.</p>
