He was the fifth player to become <a href="World_Chess_Championship" title="wikilink">World Chess Champion</a> (1935&lt;U+2013&gt;1937). Euwe also served as President of <a href="FIDE" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIDE</a>, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978. Euwe was also a highly-regarded chess writer.</p>

<p>Dr Max Euwe was born in <a href="Watergraafsmeer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Watergraafsmeer</a>, near <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a>. He studied <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> at the <a href="University_of_Amsterdam" title="wikilink">University of Amsterdam</a>, earning his doctorate in 1926,<a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=61173">1</a> and taught mathematics, first in <a href="Rotterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rotterdam</a>, and later at a girls' Lyceum in <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a>. He published a mathematical analysis of the game of chess from an <a href="intuitionistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">intuitionistic</a> point of view, in which he showed, using the <a href="Thue-Morse_sequence" title="wikilink">Thue-Morse sequence</a>, that the then current official rules did not exclude the possibility of infinite games.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Euwe won every <a href="Dutch_Chess_Championship" title="wikilink">Dutch chess championship</a> that he participated in from 1921 until 1952, and additionally won the title in 1955 - his 12 titles are still a record.

<p>}} Euwe's obituary</ref></p>
<p>Euwe had a young family and could only play competitive chess during school vacations, so his opportunities for international chess competition at the top level were limited. But he performed well in the few tournaments and matches for which he could find time from the early 1920s to the mid 1930s. Fine comments, &quot;Euwe's main international successes came in the form of narrow defeats&quot; - but these were in matches against the world's best: <a href="Alexander_Alekhine" title="wikilink"> Alekhine</a> (1926), <a href="Capablanca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Capablanca</a> (1931) and <a href="Rudolf_Spielmann" title="wikilink"> Spielmann</a> (1935); and Euwe drew a match with <a href="Salo_Flohr" title="wikilink"> Flohr</a> in 1932. His playing strength gradually increased, so that by 1932 he and Flohr were regarded as Alekhine's most credible challengers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At <a href="Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich</a> 1934, Euwe finished second, behind only World Champion <a href="Alexander_Alekhine" title="wikilink">Alexander Alekhine</a>, and he defeated Alekhine in their game. Alekhine was in an eight-year stretch, from 1927-35, where he lost only six games in tournament play.</p>
<h2 id="world-champion">World Champion</h2>

Alekhine quickly went two games ahead, but from game 13 onwards Euwe won twice as many games as Alekhine.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His title gave a huge boost to chess in The Netherlands. This was also the first world championship match in which the players had seconds to help them with analysis during adjournments.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Euwe's win was a major upset, and is sometimes attributed to Alekhine's alcoholism. But <a href="Salo_Flohr" title="wikilink">Salo Flohr</a>, who was helping Euwe during the match, thought over-confidence was more of a problem than alcohol for Alekhine in this match, and Alekhine himself said he would win easily.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><ref name="M<U+00FC>nninghoff2001EuweBiography&quot; /&gt; Former World Champions <a href="Vassily_Smyslov" title="wikilink">Vassily Smyslov</a>, <a href="Boris_Spassky" title="wikilink">Boris Spassky</a>, <a href="Anatoly_Karpov" title="wikilink">Anatoly Karpov</a> and <a href="Garry_Kasparov" title="wikilink">Garry Kasparov</a> analyzed the match for their own benefit and concluded that Euwe deserved to win and that the standard of play was worthy of a world championship.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Vladimir_Kramnik" title="wikilink">Vladimir Kramnik</a>, ex-champion and still a strong contender, said that Euwe won the 1935 match on merit and that the result was not affected by Alekhine's drinking before or during the match.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Euwe lost the title to Alekhine in a rematch in 1937, also played in The Netherlands, by a rather one-sided margin of 15.5-9.5. Alekhine had given up alcohol to prepare for the rematch, although he would start drinking again later. Alekhine got back to the sort of form he had shown from 1927-1935, when he dominated chess. The match was a real contest initially, but Euwe's play collapsed near the end and he lost four of the last five games.<ref name="chessgamesAlehineEuwe1937Table">{{ cite web</p>

<p>The two world title matches against Alekhine represent the heart of Euwe's career. Altogether, the two played 86 competitive games, and Alekhine had a +28 -20 =38 lead, according to chessgames.com. Many of Alekhine's wins came early in their series; he was nine years older, and had more experience during that time. Then in the return match, Alekhine won by six points. So, during the period 1925-1935, the two were very closely matched.</p>
<h2 id="later-career">Later career</h2>
<p>Euwe finished equal fourth with Alekhine and <a href="Samuel_Reshevsky" title="wikilink"> Reshevsky</a> in the <a href="AVRO_tournament" title="wikilink">AVRO tournament</a> of 1938 in The Netherlands, which featured the world's top eight players and was an attempt to decide who should challenge Alekhine for the world championship. Euwe also had a major organizational role in the event.<ref name="M<U+00FC>nninghoff2001EuweBiography&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>He played a match with <a href="Paul_Keres" title="wikilink">Paul Keres</a> in The Netherlands in 1939-40, losing 6.5-7.5.</p>
<p>After Alekhine's death in 1946, Euwe was considered by some to have a moral right to the position of world champion, based at least partially on his clear second place finish in the great tournament at <a href="Groningen_(city)" title="wikilink">Groningen</a> in 1946, behind <a href="Mikhail_Botvinnik" title="wikilink">Mikhail Botvinnik</a>. But Euwe consented to participate in a five-player tournament to select the new champion, the <a href="World_Chess_Championship_1948" title="wikilink">World Chess Championship 1948</a>.<ref name="M<U+00FC>nninghoff2001EuweBiography&quot; /&gt; However at 47, Euwe was significantly older than the other players, and well past his best, and he finished last.<ref>{{ cite web</p>

<p>He played for The Netherlands in a total of seven chess <a href="Olympiads" class="uri" title="wikilink">Olympiads</a>, from 1927 to 1962, a 35-year-span, always on first board.

<p>In 1957 Euwe played a short match against 14-year-old future world champion <a href="Bobby_Fischer" title="wikilink">Bobby Fischer</a>, winning one game and drawing the other. His lifetime score against Fischer was one win, one loss, and one draw.</p>
<p>Euwe won a total of 102 first prizes in tournaments during his career. While it is true that many of those were local and were not very strong, the total is very impressive, considering that Euwe was never a true professional player.<ref name="DenkerParr1995FischerIKnew">{{ cite book</p>

<h2 id="fide-president">FIDE President</h2>
<p>From 1970 (when he was 69 years old) until 1978, he was president of the <a href="F&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration_Internationale_des_&lt;U+00C9&gt;checs" title="wikilink">FIDE</a>. As president Euwe usually did what he considered morally right rather than what was politically expedient. On several occasions this brought him into conflict with the Soviet Chess Federation, which thought it had the right to call the shots because it contributed a very large share of FIDE's budget and Soviet players dominated the world rankings - in effect they treated chess as an extension of the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>. These conflicts included:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The events leading up to <a href="Bobby_Fischer" title="wikilink">Bobby Fischer</a>'s participation in the <a href="World_Chess_Championship_1972" title="wikilink">World Chess Championship 1972</a> match against <a href="Boris" title="wikilink"> Spassky</a>, which led to Fischer's becoming the first non-Soviet champion since <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Euwe thought it important for the health and reputation of the game that Fischer should have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible and interpreted the rules very flexibly to enable Fischer to play in the 1971 <a href="Candidates_Tournament" title="wikilink">Candidates Tournament</a>.</li>
<li>The defection of grandmaster <a href="Gennadi_Sosonko" title="wikilink">Gennadi Sosonko</a> in 1972. The Soviets demanded that Sosonko should be treated as an &quot;<a href="unperson" class="uri" title="wikilink">unperson</a>&quot;, excluded from competitive chess, television or any other event that might be evidence of his defection. Euwe refused, and no Soviet players took part in the 1974 <a href="Wijk_aan_Zee" title="wikilink">Wijk aan Zee</a> tournament in The Netherlands because Sosonko was playing in it.</li>
<li>In 1976 world championship contender <a href="Viktor_Korchnoi" title="wikilink">Viktor Korchnoi</a> sought <a href="political_asylum" title="wikilink">political asylum</a> in The Netherlands. In a discussion a few days earlier Euwe told Korchnoi, &quot;...of course you will retain all your rights ...&quot; and later opposed Soviet efforts to prevent Korchnoi from challenging for <a href="Anatoly_Karpov" title="wikilink">Anatoly Karpov</a>'s title in 1978.</li>
<li>Later in 1976 Euwe supported FIDE's decision to hold the 1976 <a href="Chess_Olympiad" title="wikilink">Chess Olympiad</a> in <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, which the Soviet Union did not <a href="Diplomatic_recognition" title="wikilink"> recognize</a> as a country. The <a href="Central_Committee" title="wikilink">Central Committee</a> of <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> then started plotting to depose Euwe as president of FIDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course Euwe lost some of the battles with the Soviets. For example in 1973 he accepted the Soviets' demand that <a href="Bent_Larsen" title="wikilink">Bent Larsen</a> and <a href="Robert_H&lt;U+00FC&gt;bner" title="wikilink">Robert H&lt;U+00FC&gt;bner</a>, the two strongest non-Soviet contenders (Fischer was now champion), should play in the Leningrad <a href="Interzonal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Interzonal</a> tournament rather than the weaker one in <a href="Petropolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petropolis</a>. Unsurprisingly Larsen and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;bner were eliminated from the competition for the World Championship because Korchnoi and Karpov took the first 2 places at Leningrad.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some commentators have also questioned whether Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title in 1975.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the turbulence of the period most assessments of Euwe's performance as president of FIDE are sympathetic:<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Spassky, who had nominated Euwe for the job: &quot;He should certainly not have disqualified Fischer, and he should have been a little tougher with the Soviets.... you get a pile of complicated problems. But Euwe, of course, was the man for the job.&quot;</li>
<li>Karpov said Euwe was a very good FIDE President, although he did commit one very serious error, rapidly extending the membership of FIDE to many small <a href="third-world" class="uri" title="wikilink">third-world</a> countries. &quot;But neither he nor I could have foreseen what this would lead to. ... This led not only to the inflation of the grandmaster title, but also to the leadership vacuum at the head of the world of chess.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="Garry_Kasparov" title="wikilink">Garry Kasparov</a> was blunter: &quot;... unfortunately, he could not foresee the dangers flowing from a FIDE practically under Soviet dominance.&quot;</li>
<li>Korchnoi regarded Euwe as the last honorable president of FIDE.</li>
<li><a href="Yuri_Averbakh" title="wikilink">Yuri Averbakh</a>, who was a Soviet chess official as well as a grandmaster: &quot;... he always sought to understand the opposing point of view ... Such behavior was in sharp contrast to the behavior of the Soviet delegation leaders ... Max Euwe was, without a doubt, the best President FIDE ever had.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>He died in 1981, age 80, of a heart attack. Revered around the chess world for his many contributions, he had travelled extensively while FIDE President, bringing many new members into the organization.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-of-euwes-chess">Assessment of Euwe's chess</h2>
<p>Euwe was noted for his logical approach and for his knowledge of the openings, in which he made major contributions to chess theory.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Paradoxically his two title matches with <a href="Alexander_Alekhine" title="wikilink">Alexander Alekhine</a> were displays of tactical ferocity from both sides. But the comments by Kmoch and Alekhine (below) may explain this: Euwe &quot;strode confidently into some extraordinarily complex variations&quot; if he thought logic was on his side; and he was extremely good at calculating these variations. On the other hand he &quot;often lacked the stamina to pull himself out of bad positions&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Alekhine was allegedly more frank in his Russian-language articles than in those he wrote in English, French or German. In his Russian articles he often described Euwe as lacking in originality and in the mental toughness required of a world champion. <a href="Gennadi_Sosonko" title="wikilink">Gennadi Sosonko</a> thought Euwe's modesty was a handicap in top-class chess (although Euwe was well aware of how much stronger he was than &quot;ordinary&quot; grandmasters).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Vladimir_Kramnik" title="wikilink">Vladimir Kramnik</a> also says Euwe anticipated <a href="Botvinnik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Botvinnik</a>'s emphasis on technical preparation,<ref name="KramnikSteinitzToKasparov">{{ cite web</p>

<h2 id="quotations">Quotations</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Strategy requires thought; tactics requires observation.&quot; - Max Euwe</li>
<li>&quot;Does the general public, do even our friends the critics realize that Euwe virtually never made an unsound combination? He may, of course, occasionally fail to take account of an opponent's combination, but when he has the initiative in a tactical operation his calculation is impeccable.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Alexander Alekhine</li>
<li>&quot;If Richard Reti was interested only in the exceptions to positional rules, then Max Euwe believed perhaps a little too much in their immutability.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Alexander Alekhine</li>
<li>&quot;He is logic personified, a genius of law and order. One would hardly call him an attacking player, yet he strides confidently into some extraordinarily complex variations.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Hans_Kmoch" title="wikilink">Hans Kmoch</a></li>
<li>&quot;Euwe can only breathe freely when he is smothered in work.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Hans Kmoch</li>
<li>&quot;Euwe resting would not be Euwe. His star is work, work, and more work. Work is his entertainment, his strength and his destiny.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Hans Kmoch</li>
<li>&quot;There's something wrong with that man. He's too normal.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Bobby Fischer</li>
