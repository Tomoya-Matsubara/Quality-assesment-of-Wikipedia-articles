<p>The <strong>Counterterrorism Division</strong> (<strong>CTD</strong>) is a division of the <a href="FBI_National_Security_Branch" title="wikilink">National Security Branch</a> of the <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>. CTD investigates <a href="terrorism" title="wikilink">terrorist</a> threats inside the United States, provides information on terrorists outside the country, and tracks known terrorists worldwide. In the wake of the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, CTD's funding and manpower have significantly increased.</p>
<p>The Division employs counterterrorism field operations organized into squads, the number of which varies according to the amount and diversity of activity in the <a href="List_of_FBI_Field_Offices" title="wikilink">local field office's</a> jurisdiction. Larger field offices, such as <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, maintain counterterrorism squads for each major terrorist group, as well as for domestic terrorism and terrorist financing, while smaller field offices combined such responsibilities across two to three squads.</p>

<p>The Counterterrorism Division is headed by Assistant Director, who reports to the Executive Assistant Director of the <a href="FBI_National_Security_Branch" title="wikilink">FBI National Security Branch</a>. The current Assistant Director is Andrew McCabe, who was appointed by former FBI Director <a href="Robert_Mueller" title="wikilink">Robert Mueller</a> on May 9, 2012.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>The Counterterrorism Division has four branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations Branch I</li>
<li>Operations Branch II</li>
<li>Analytical Branch</li>
<li>Operational Support Branch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operations Branch I</strong> is composed of two sections: International Terrorism Operations Section I (ITOS-I) and International Terrorism Operations Section II (ITOS-II). The ITOS-I covers <a href="al_Qaeda" title="wikilink">al Qaeda</a> terrorist activity on a regional basis in the United States and abroad. ITOS-II focuses on four non-al Qaeda groups: <a href="Palestinian_people" title="wikilink">Palestinian</a> rejectionist groups, <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a> and <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>/<a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>/<a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a>, and other global terrorist groups. ITOS II has a <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> agent serving as Deputy Section Chief, and an FBI agent is detailed to the CIA's <a href="Counterterrorism_Center" title="wikilink">Counterterrorism Center</a> as that unit's Deputy Director.</p>
<p><strong>Operations Branch II</strong> includes three more disparate sections: the <a href="Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction" title="wikilink">Weapons of Mass Destruction</a> and Domestic Terrorism Section (WMD/DT), <a href="Communications_Exploitation_Section" title="wikilink">Communications Exploitation Section</a> (CXS), and Terrorist Financing Operations Section (TFOS).</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>The WMD/DT Section, despite its presence within the domestically focused Operations Branch II, is international in scope and function.</li>
<li>The TFOS is an operational and coordinating entity. It directs <a href="terrorism_financing" title="wikilink">terrorism financing</a> investigations and works jointly with partners to block and freeze assets. However, its primary role is to coordinate and support the financial components of terrorism investigations conducted by ITOS I and II. The TFOS mission is to identify, investigate, prosecute, disrupt, and incrementally dismantle all terrorist-related financial and fund-raising activities. The section is composed of four units:
<ul>
<li>Radical Fundamentalist Financial Investigative Unit</li>
<li>Domestic WMD and Global Financial Investigations Unit</li>
<li>Global Extremist Financial Investigations Unit</li>
<li>Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Analytical Branch</strong> includes two sections: the Counterterrorism Analysis Section (which supports Operations I and II) and the Terrorism Reports and Requirements Section (TRRS). The Branch also includes a Strategic Assessment and Analysis Unit, Production and Publications Unit.</p>
<p>The <strong>Operational Support Branch</strong> manages the CTD's administrative and resource functions, FBI detailees to other agencies, and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force. The various local <a href="Joint_Terrorism_Task_Force" title="wikilink">Joint Terrorism Task Forces</a> falls under the domain of this branch.</p>
