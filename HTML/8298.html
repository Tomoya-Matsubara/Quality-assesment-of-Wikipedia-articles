Along with its companion piece of the same size, <em><a href="The_Second_of_May_1808" title="wikilink">The Second of May 1808</a></em> (also known as <em>The Charge of the <a href="Mamluk#Mamluks_in_the_service_of_Napoleon" title="wikilink">Mamelukes</a></em>), it was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain at Goya's suggestion to commemorate Spanish resistance to <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s armies during the occupation of 1808.</p>
<p>For its content, presentation and emotional force, the painting is widely regarded as groundbreaking, and an archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although Goya drew from a wide range of high and popular art sources when composing the work, in many respects <em>The Third of May 1808</em> represents a clear break from established conventions. In its variance from both the traditional depictions of war and the traditions of <a href="Christian_art" title="wikilink">Christian art</a> the painting had no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> According to the art historian <a href="Kenneth_Clark" title="wikilink">Kenneth Clark</a>, <em>The Third of May 1808</em> is &quot;the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention ...&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

The reigning Spanish sovereign, <a href="Carlos_IV" title="wikilink">Carlos IV</a>, was regarded as a lightweight internationally. Even in his own court he was seen as a &quot;half-wit king who renounces cares of state for the satisfaction of hunting&quot;, and a cuckold unable to control his energetic wife. Napoleon took advantage of the weak king by suggesting the two nations conquer and divide Portugal, with France and Spain each taking a third of the spoils, with the final third going to the Spanish Prime Minister <a href="Manuel_de_Godoy" title="wikilink">Manuel de Godoy</a>, along with the title of <em>Prince of the <a href="Algarve" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algarve</a></em>. Godoy was seduced, and accepted the French offer. However, Godoy failed to grasp Napoleon's true intentions, and was unaware that his new ally and co-sovereign, the former King's son <a href="Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Ferdinand VII of Spain</a>, was using the invasion merely as a device to seize the Spanish parliament and throne. Ferdinand intended not only that Godoy be killed during the takeover, but also intended to sacrifice the lives of his own parents during the impending power struggle.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the Spanish people had accepted foreign monarchs in the past, they were deeply resentful of the new French rule. On <a href="May_2" title="wikilink">May 2</a>, <a href="1808" class="uri" title="wikilink">1808</a>, provoked by news of the planned removal to France of the last members of the Spanish Royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the <a href="Dos_de_Mayo_Uprising" title="wikilink">Dos de Mayo Uprising</a>.

He had supported the initial aims of the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, and hoped for a similar development in Spain. Goya's 1798 portrait of the French ambassador turned Commandant Ferdinand Guillemardet betrays a personal admiration.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Yet while maintaining his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary, Goya had by nature an instinctive dislike of authority.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He witnessed the subjugation of his countrymen by the French troops.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During these years he painted little, although the experiences of the occupation provided inspiration for drawings that would form the basis for his prints in the <em>The Disasters of War (Los desastres de la guerra)</em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>[[Image:Goya_No_se_puede_mirar.jpg|thumb|<a href="Goya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goya</a>, <em>One cannot look at this, (No se puede mirar),</em> <a href="Commons:Los_desastres_de_la_guerra" title="wikilink"><em>The Disasters of War (Los desastres de la guerra)]],</em> ca.1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1814, a very similar composition. The <em>The Disasters</em> series of etches all date from 1810s, but it is not known which prints pre-date the paintings. However it seems accepted by critics that Goya was freer in expression in the prints, and conformed more to traditional conventions in his paintings.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></a> The painting is set at night, and centers on two masses of men; one a rigidly poised <a href="Execution_by_firing_squad" title="wikilink">firing squad</a>, the other a disorganized group of captives held at gun point. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Clark, &quot;By a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A square lantern is situated on the ground between the two groups, and throws a strong light, creating the effect of a staged scene. However, the painting is not intended by Goya as a formalized decoration, or political tableau.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, a number of other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His yellow and white clothing reflects the colors of the lantern.</p>
<p>On the right side of the canvas, engulfed in shadow, stands the firing squad, painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their <a href="shako" title="wikilink">shakos</a> and <a href="bayonets" class="uri" title="wikilink">bayonets</a> form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a <a href="repoussoir" class="uri" title="wikilink">repoussoir</a> at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Between the hillside and the shakos there is a crowd with torches in the distance, perhaps onlookers, or more soldiers or victims.</p>
<p><em>One cannot look at this</em> (<em>No se puede mirar</em>), one of the <a href="aquatint" class="uri" title="wikilink">aquatint</a> <a href="etching" title="wikilink">etchings</a> from the series <em>The Disasters of War (Los desastres de la guerra)</em>, is clearly related compositionally and thematically.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It is unclear if this was produced before or after <em>The Third of May 1808</em>, as the series etching were apparently created throughout the 1810s. In <em>One cannot look at this</em>, the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, whilst another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.</p>
<p>The <em>Second</em> and <em>Third of May</em> are thought to have been intended as part of a larger series.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya may have painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867 Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of <em>The Second of May</em>, and an artist and collector of Goya named Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal F&lt;U+00E9&gt;rriz asserted the presence of two other paintings of the theme, a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Contemporary prints provide precedence for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the subject, that of a popular insurrection.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="provenance">Provenance</h3>
<p>Despite the work's commemorative value, there are no surviving contemporaneous accounts mentioning the painting, and it is unknown when or where it was first exhibited. This apparent lack of comment may be due to Fernando VII's preference for neoclassical art,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> while popular revolts of any kind were not regarded as suitable subject matter by the restored <a href="House_of_Bourbon" title="wikilink">Bourbons</a>. According to some accounts the painting lay in storage for thirty to forty years before being shown to the public.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A monument to the fallen in the uprising, also commissioned in 1814 by the provisional government, &quot;was stopped by Ferdinand VII, in whose eyes the senators and heroes of the war of independence found small favour, on account of their reforming tendencies&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> That the painting remained in the possession of the government or monarchy is indicated by its mention in an 1834 Prado inventory;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> much of the royal collection had been transferred to the Museum upon its opening in 1819. <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;ophile_Gautier" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;ophile Gautier</a> mentioned seeing 'a massacre' by Goya during a visit to the museum in 1845, while a visitor in 1858 noted the same painting. However both accounts refer to the work as depicting the events of the second of May;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> the <em><a href="Dos_de_Mayo_Uprising" title="wikilink">Dos de Mayo Uprising</a></em> continues to be the Spanish name for the whole episode. In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte considered the painting important enough to suggest it be honored by a special exhibition.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>It was not until 1872 that <em>The Third of May</em> was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title <em>Scene of the Third of May 1808</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The Prado mentions that both Pr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ncipe P&lt;U+00ED&gt;o paintings suffered damage while being transported to <a href="Valencia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valencia</a> during the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>, apparently the only time they have left Madrid.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

Historically artists had tended to depict war in the high style of <a href="history_painting" title="wikilink">history painting</a>, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. An early view by critics was that the painting was flawed on technical grounds; that the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be correct, according to the writer <a href="Richard_Schickel" title="wikilink">Richard Schickel</a>, the fact that Goya did not strive for academic correctness lends to the overall force and impression of the piece.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Third of May</em> references a number of earlier works of art, however its power resides not in its adherence to traditional compositional formulas, but in its bluntness.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Pictorial artifice has here given way to the epic depiction of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic painters</a>, who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war and death, composed their paintings with greater artifice. This and their awareness of the conventions of beauty, is evident in <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore_G&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricault" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore G&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricault</a>'s <em><a href="Raft_of_the_Medusa" title="wikilink">Raft of the Medusa</a></em> (1818&lt;U+2013&gt;19) and <a href="Eugene_Delacroix" title="wikilink">Eugene Delacroix</a>'s 1830 painting <em><a href="Liberty_Leading_the_People" title="wikilink">Liberty Leading the People</a></em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Goya_3may_hand.jpg" title="fig:Detail of the victim&#39;s right hand which shows a stigmata, a mark of Christ." alt="Detail of the victim&#39;s right hand which shows a stigmata, a mark of Christ." /> The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of <a href="martyrdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyrdom</a> in <a href="Christian_art" title="wikilink">Christian art</a>, for example in its use of light and darkness, and its appeal to life juxtaposed against the inevitability of imminent execution,.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Even works within this tradition that depict violentce, such as those of <a href="Jusepe_de_Ribera" title="wikilink">Jusepe de Ribera</a>, have a harmony in composition, and anticipate the &quot;crown of martyrdom&quot; for the victim.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>The Third of May,</em> the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a <a href="crucifixion" title="wikilink">crucified</a> Christ,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ's nocturnal <em><a href="Agony_in_the_Garden" title="wikilink">Agony in the Garden</a></em> of Gethsemane.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Goya's figure displays <a href="stigmata" class="uri" title="wikilink">stigmata</a>-like marks on his right hand,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> while the lantern at the center of the canvass references a traditional <a href="attribute" class="uri" title="wikilink">attribute</a> of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion, but he wears yellow and white, the heraldic colors of the <a href="Pope" title="wikilink">Papacy</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In <em>The Third of May,</em> however, there is no attempt to find transcendence, and no sense that the sacrifice of life will lead to salvation.</p>
<p><img src="Saint_barthelemy.jpg" title="fig:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo&#39;s 1722 St. Bartholomew is a traditional scene of martyrdom, with the saint beseeching God. Goya drew inspiration from the iconography of such violent scenes." alt="Giovanni Battista Tiepolo&#39;s 1722 St. Bartholomew is a traditional scene of martyrdom, with the saint beseeching God. Goya drew inspiration from the iconography of such violent scenes." /> The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by <a href="Baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> artists, and perfected by <a href="Caravaggio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caravaggio</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant <a href="chiaroscuro" class="uri" title="wikilink">chiaroscuro</a> were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Whether manifested by torch or candle light, illumination took on religious connotations. In <em>The Third of May</em> the role of the lantern indicates no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that we may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been inverted.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The victim is presented by Goya as anonymous as his killers, and his entreaty is delivered not, as in traditional painting, to God, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will momentarily share the same fate. Here, for the first time, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity seen as a modern condition.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The progression of time in Goya&lt;U+2019&gt;s painting is a further element without precedent in Western art history.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In earlier paintings, the death of a subject was typically depicted as a conclusive act, and endowed with the virtue of heroism. The <em>Third of May</em> furnishes no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned into a formalized mechanization of murder. That which is inevitable is seen in the corpse of the man splayed on the ground in the lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The unfortunate victim is painted in a manner devoid of either aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture Goya has placed our eye level mostly along the central horizontal axis, only here changing the perspectival point of view so that we look down on the mutilated body.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, there is no attempt by the artist to ameliorate the subject&lt;U+2019&gt;s brutality through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya&lt;U+2019&gt;s technique owes less to the artfulness of traditional virtuosity than it does to the intrinsic morbidity of the subject.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself is characteristic of that which Goya would employ in many of his later works; a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> It is difficult to conceive of admiring the work for painterly flourishes, such is the forcefulness of its horror and its lack of theatricality.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

Depicitions of firing squads were popular in Spanish political imagery during the Napoleonic War.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Goya's appropriations suggest that he may have been interested in painting works of heroic scale that would appeal to the general public.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Miguel Gamborino's 1813 devotional print <em>The Assassination of Five Monks from Valencia</em> is thought to have served as a source for Goya's composition.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Points of similarity include a victim in a posture of crucifixion, whose white garment sets him apart from his companions; a <a href="tonsure" title="wikilink">tonsured</a> monk with clenched hands who kneels to his left; and, an executed corpse lying in the foreground.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Unlike Gamborino, however, Goya did not include angels in his scene.</p>

The outstretched arms of David's three Roman <a href="Horatii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horatii</a> in <a href="Roman_salute" title="wikilink">salute</a> have become, in Goya's work, the rifles of the firing squad; the upraised arms of the Horatiis' father are, in the Goya, the victim's gesture as he faces the riflemen. While David painted his figures' expressions with a neoclassical luster, Goya's reply is fashioned from brutal realism.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Goya may also have been responding to a painting by <a href="Antoine-Jean_Gros" title="wikilink">Antoine-Jean Gros</a>; the French occupation of Madrid is the subject of Gros's <em>Capitulation of Madrid, The Fourth of December 1808</em>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Goya is thought to have been influenced by works of <a href="Peter_Paul_Rubens" title="wikilink">Rubens</a> such as his versions of the <em><a href="Massacre_of_the_Innocents_(Rubens)" title="wikilink">Massacre of the Innocents</a></em>, and <em>The Horrors of War,</em> painted after 1638. That Goya was influenced by Rubens is clear because he also painted a version of <em><a href="Saturn_Devouring_His_Son" title="wikilink">Saturn Devouring His Son</a>,</em> c.1819&lt;U+2013&gt;1823 that was influenced by Rubens' 1636 painting of the same name, now in the Prado. Kenneth Clark felt the <em>Second of May</em> an &quot;artistic failure ... perhaps he could not shake off the memory of similar compositions by Rubens&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Indicating his close interest in Rubens' work, Goya also produced a chalk drawing of the Saturn subject in 1796&lt;U+2013&gt;7 that was even closer in tone to Rubens.</p>

<p>The first paraphrasing of <em>The Third of May</em> was <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;douard_Manet" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;douard Manet</a>'s <em>Execution of the Emperor Maximilian</em>, painted in several versions in 1867&lt;U+2013&gt;69. In giving visual form to an event he did not witness, and which was not recorded in photographs,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Manet apparently relied on the example of Goya's composition. It is possible that he saw Goya's painting at the Prado in 1865, before finishing his <em>Execution</em> for the <a href="Salon_(Paris)" title="wikilink">Salon</a> of 1867,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and in any case he saw it in the form of a reproductive print that was published in 1867 by an acquaintance of Manet.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Art critic <a href="Arthur_Danto" title="wikilink">Arthur Danto</a> made a comparison between Goya's <em>The Third of May</em> and Manet's several versions of the <em>Execution of the Emperor Maximilian</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Third of May</em> also depicts an execution, an early event in the so-called <a href="Peninsular_War" title="wikilink">Peninsular War</a> between France and Spain. <a href="Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The <em>Third of May</em> execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a <a href="guerrilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">guerrilla</a> attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the <a href="massacre" class="uri" title="wikilink">massacre</a>, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred on the part of Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Aldous_Huxley" title="wikilink">Aldous Huxley</a>, who in 1959 published an essay on the etchings of Goya, thought Goya lacked Rubens ability to fill the canvas with an ordered composition. However, Huxley believed that the <em>Tres de Mayo</em> succeeded because, Goya &quot;is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able to express what he wants to say with maximum force and clarity&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Kenneth Clark described the character of <em>The Third of May</em> by alluding to its radical departure from <a href="history_painting" title="wikilink">history painting</a> and its singular intensity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Goya we do not think of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May is a kind of superior journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.&quot;''<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
