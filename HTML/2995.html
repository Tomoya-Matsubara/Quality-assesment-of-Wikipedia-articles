<p><strong>Hurricane Kate</strong> was the final in a series of <a href="tropical_cyclones" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> to impact the United States during 1985 and the latest in any calendar year to <a href="Landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">strike</a> the country at hurricane intensity on record. The eleventh <a href="tropical_cyclone_naming" title="wikilink">named storm</a>, seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane of the <a href="1985_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">annual hurricane season</a>,{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category 3 or higher on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Kate originated from the interaction of an upper-level <a href="Trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> and <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> northeast of <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a> on November 15. Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence, the intensification of a region of <a href="High-pressure_area" title="wikilink">high pressure</a> to the cyclone's north caused Kate to turn westward. A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November 16, and further to <a href="Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Category 2</a> intensity three days later. Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November 19. Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) the following day. On November 21, a <a href="cold_front" title="wikilink">cold front</a> moving across the <a href="Mississippi_Valley" title="wikilink">Mississippi Valley</a> resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and Kate came ashore near <a href="Mexico_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Mexico Beach, Florida</a>, as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the <a href="Southeast_United_States" title="wikilink">Southeast United States</a> coastline, and Kate transitioned to an <a href="Extratropical_transition#extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> on November 23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina.</p>
<p>The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360,000 people. Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding, killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage. Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages, significant building damage, and major crop damage. Damage totaled roughly $400 million,{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1985 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">United States dollars</a>.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades. In preparation of the system, many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect. Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated, and the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency for six counties in Florida; this was later relinquished following the relatively minor impacts of Kate. In addition, many shelters were opened. When Kate struck the <a href="Florida_Panhandle" title="wikilink">Florida Panhandle</a>, it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since <a href="Hurricane_Eloise" title="wikilink">Hurricane Eloise</a> in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100 mph (160 km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while a combination of the wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the Southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15 fatalities and $700 million in damage.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>Before the formation of Hurricane Kate, a <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> was located across the southeastern United States for much of the autumn of 1985; concurrently, a major <a href="trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> persisted across the western portion of the country. As a result, weather conditions across the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September, including <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">sea surface temperatures</a> of 81 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (27 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C). On November 13, a weak <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a>{{#tag:ref|A tropical wave is an inverted <a href="trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> of low pressure that moves along the <a href="trade_wind" title="wikilink">trade winds</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser Antilles</a>. It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions, and on November 15, a <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight into the area indicated the <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">development</a> of a <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a>. As gale force winds were already present, the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate, about 240 miles (385 km) northeast of <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>With a ridge to its north, Kate tracked westward after developing, and an <a href="cold-core_low" title="wikilink">upper-level low</a> developed to the southwest of the storm. The combination of the two provided favorable <a href="outflow_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">outflow</a>, allowing Kate to quickly intensify. On November 16, the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After continued strengthening, Kate made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> at 0600 UTC on November 19 over north-central Cuba with a well-defined <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> When it moved ashore, Kate had a <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> of  and winds of about .<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The hurricane maintained its well-defined eye while moving across northern Cuba, and about 12 hours after making landfall, it emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico just east of Havana. Over the next 24 hours, Kate re-intensified off the southwest coast of Florida as it passed about 85 mi (135 km) southwest of <a href="Key_West,_Florida" title="wikilink">Key West</a>. On November 20, the Hurricane Hunters observed winds as strong as 125 mph (200 km/h), and a buoy recorded a gust of ;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> this was the highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in the Gulf of Mexico until <a href="Hurricane_Lili" title="wikilink">Hurricane Lili</a> in 2002.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Based on these observations, it was estimated that Kate attained peak winds of about  around 1200 UTC on November 20.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November 22. Encountering even colder waters and continued shear, the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast. On November 23, Kate transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> to the west of Bermuda,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> terminating at 1800 UTC that day.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Until 2011, Kate's was considered the second-latest <em>hurricane</em> landfall in the United States, behind only a <a href="1925_Florida_tropical_storm" title="wikilink">cyclone in 1925</a> that struck on December 1; however, a systematic <a href="Atlantic_hurricane_reanalysis" title="wikilink">reanalysis</a> indicated the 1925 system was only a tropical storm. In turn, Kate took the record.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> With Kate's landfall, the 1985 season had six hurricanes that struck the United States, only one short of the record seven in <a href="1886_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1886</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>By November 18, a <a href="Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">hurricane warning</a> was in effect for the southeast and central Bahamas and the <a href="Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" title="wikilink">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Flood warnings were issued for northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In preparation for the hurricane's arrival, officials forced 360,000 people to evacuate in north-central Cuba.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
