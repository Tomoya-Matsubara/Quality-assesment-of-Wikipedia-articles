<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Siddhant Dheer, the head of the Anti-Terrorist Cell(a fictitious organisation) narrates how rampant terrorism has become and goes on to tell the story of 7 hardest days in his life. ATC has a tip about an impending terrorist attack on 10 May, targeting 20-25 thousand people. The man behind the plan is one Jamwaal, a Keyser S&lt;U+00F6&gt;ze who is feared by politicos and law enforcement alike. Only other information known about the impending attack is the codeword &quot;JEET&quot;. Later, a woman is shot dead in her own home by an unknown assailant. Siddhant gets a tip from Neha, an undercover officer stationed by him in Canada that an aide of Jamwaal named Himmat Mehendi has been arrested by Canadian police.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ATC succeeds in nabbing a goon named Altaf, who was hired by Jamwaal to kill his former friends, Aasif and Irfan. Siddhant sends his brother Shashank with Aditya undercover to Canada to kidnap and interrogate Himmat. The duo arrive in Canada and get acquainted with Dan, a Canadian cop. Himmat initially claims to be a man named JD, but later breaks down and tells them that he was tricked into working for Jamwaal. He tells them that even he has not seen Jamwaal's face. Here, when his sister Anu and her husband are kidnapped by some terrorists in lieu of returning Altaf, Siddhant realizes that there is a mole in ATC itself.</p>
<p>The mole is later revealed to be a co-worker named Roy, who informs them about &quot;JEET&quot; before committing suicide. Meanwhile, in Canada, Himmat is conned to believe that Jamwaal is out to get him. Himmat finally tells them that only Aasif and Irfan know Jamwaal's location. They nab and interrogate Aasif in his own club, but Aasif commits suicide after telling about Irfan's location. Here, Anu's husband is killed but Anu is saved. Altaf reveals that Jamwaal feared that his former friends turned enemies could foil his plans. A trap is set to expose all the bigwigs involved by using Altaf's testimony.</p>
<p>Siddhant decides to go to Canada. Dan, Aditya and Shashank have a showdown with Irfan, thus killing him. With both Aasif and Irfan dead, Jamwaal's threat is neutralized. They release Himmat, after which Shashank decides to propose Neha. The trio go to her home, only to realize that somebody is snooping around. Shashank and Aditya are surprised to find that it is Siddhant. Siddhant shocks them even further by telling them that Neha is dead. One by one, all blocks start to fall into pieces. It is revealed that the woman murdered earlier was real Neha and that the man they mistook for Himmat Mehendi was actually Jamwaal. Siddhant explains that when Altaf was nabbed, Jamwaal also got caught in an accident and arrested under a false name. What he intended to do using Altaf was instead done by the trio.</p>
<p>Realizing that they still don't know Jamwaal's intentions, they turn to decrypt the meaning of JEET. They finally realize that Jamwaal is going to bomb a stadium where Indian and Canadian politicians are going to be present along with 20-25 thousand spectators. Despite having no knowledge of the bomb's location, the quartet turn up at the stadium, where they separate and try to locate it. Siddhant is overpowered by Jamwaal's goons while Shashank stops the other goons from detonating the bomb early. Realizing that he has little time left, he decides to put the bombs in a helicopter and crash it in a deserted place. The fake Neha decides to side by him and accompanies him.</p>
<p>The task becomes no easier when Aditya finds out a jeep filled with enough bombs to destroy the stadium. Dan, on the other hand, discovers that his estranged wife is held hostage there along with several school children. Siddhant succeeds in hunting down the goons and runs into Jamwaal. Since he has not seen Jamwaal's face, latter nearly succeeds in escaping, but Siddhant outruns him. Meanwhile, Dan succeeds in saving some kids held hostage. Here, Shashank makes a drastic decision - to dive into a lake along with the helicopter. Both Siddhant and Aditya try to talk him out of it, but the talks prove futile.</p>
<p>Shashank plunges the helicopter in a lake, killing himself and fake Neha. Aditya is also about to blow up, when he is rescued. The jeep goes down a cliff and explodes midway. Here, Siddhant is lamenting the loss of Shashank in the stadium, while Jamwaal tries to escape after seeing his plans foiled. His luck is short-lived when Siddhant guns him down. In the end, Siddhant is shown along with his family, co-workers and Dan, sprinkling the ashes of Shashank in a river. Siddhant ends the story telling that those were the very hard 7 days in his life and everything had returned to normal, except that his brother had got lost somewhere.</p>
