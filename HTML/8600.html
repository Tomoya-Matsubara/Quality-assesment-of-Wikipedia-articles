<p>The <strong>Treaty of Fort Wise</strong> of 1861 was a treaty entered into between the United States and six chiefs of the Southern <a href="Cheyenne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheyenne</a> and four of the Southern <a href="Arapaho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arapaho</a> <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_North_America" title="wikilink">Indian</a> tribes. A significant proportion of Cheyennes opposed this treaty on the grounds that only a minority of Cheyenne chiefs had signed, and without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe. Different responses to the treaty became a source of conflict between whites and Indians, leading to the <a href="Colorado_War" title="wikilink">Colorado War</a> of 1864, including the <a href="Sand_Creek_Massacre" title="wikilink">Sand Creek Massacre</a>.</p>

<p>On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> at <a href="Bent&#39;s_Old_Fort_National_Historic_Site#Destruction" title="wikilink">Bent's New Fort</a> at <a href="Big_Timbers" title="wikilink">Big Timbers</a> near what is now <a href="Lamar,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Lamar, Colorado</a>, recently leased by the U.S. Government and renamed <a href="Fort_Wise" title="wikilink">Fort Wise</a>, in which they ceded to the United States most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Cheyenne chiefs were <a href="Black_Kettle" title="wikilink">Black Kettle</a>, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

The whites, however, claimed the treaty was a &quot;solemn obligation&quot; and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The beginning of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> in 1861 led to the organization of military forces in <a href="Colorado_Territory" title="wikilink">Colorado Territory</a>.

Following the battle, the <a href="1st_Colorado_Volunteers" title="wikilink">First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers</a> returned to Colorado Territory and were mounted as a home guard under the command of Colonel <a href="John_Chivington" title="wikilink">John Chivington</a>. Chivington and Colorado territorial governor <a href="John_Evans_(governor)" title="wikilink">John Evans</a> adopted a hard line against Indians.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Continuing escalation led to the <a href="Colorado_War" title="wikilink">Colorado War</a> of 1864-1865. On November 29, 1864, troops under Chivington attacked a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho camp at Sand Creek on the reserve established for them under the Treaty of Fort Wise.
