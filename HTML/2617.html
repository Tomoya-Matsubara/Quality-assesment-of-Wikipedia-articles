<p>The Belfast Fire Brigade came into existence in 1800. It developed to become an essential local service, providing an effective firefighting service to the people of Belfast city until its amalgamation with the Northern Ireland Fire Authority on 1 October 1973, thus becoming the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland. This article will contain a brief history of the Belfast Fire Brigade from its commencement to amalgamation.</p>
<p>The original settlement, which was later to become Belfast was situated about a ford which crossed the <a href="River_Lagan" title="wikilink">River Lagan</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> dating back to the seventh century. In 1306, mention is made of a chapel on a ford, where the current day <a href="St_George_Church_Belfast" title="wikilink">St. Georges Church of Ireland</a> is situated. At this time in history church bells would have been employed to raise the alert to the town&lt;U+2019&gt;s folk of impending danger and as such they may have been the first mechanical means of mobilising people to extinguish an outbreak of fire in the area.</p>

<p>In subsequent years, little development took place in the use of firefighting equipment and procedures, other than the use of basic hand tools and ladders, along with the use of leather buckets, which were used to transport water from open water supplies, to the scene of fire. On Sunday, 25 April 1708, a fire broke out in <a href="Belfast_Castle" title="wikilink">Belfast Castle</a>, which led to the loss of life of five young women, along with the complete destruction of the castle. The limited capability of firefighting equipment used in the attempt to extinguish the fire was a major contributing factor according to the first account of the Fire Brigade in Belfast circa 1740, as recorded in 'A history of the town of Belfast' page 609 &quot;Twelve or more round holes covered with flags be made in Front Street(High Street) at different parts of the arch which covers the river; that six movable barrel pumps be made; that six decent men be taught to work, take asunder, and put them together at a salary of 30 shillings a year each, and a crown every time they attend a real fire.... This was the Fire Brigade of more than 90 years ago.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>With the introduction in 1800 of the Belfast police act, a requirement was made of the Belfast Corporation to provide a fire service. &quot;They immediately set aside &lt;U+00A3&gt;143.8.2 for the purchase of a new fire engine from Tilley and company of Blackfriars Road in London.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>During the early to mid 1800s several attempts were made by the Belfast Corporation to approach insurance companies for financial assistance in the support of the Belfast Fire Brigade, but very limited investment was made. Such financial support was commonplace throughout larger towns and cities in England and Scotland. In 1840 purchase was made of the first steam power fire engine in Belfast. Merryweather, the fire engine manufacturer supplied a subsequent fire engine the following year; this greatly reduced the time taken for the Fire Brigade to attend any given fire incident and also increase the area over which the Fire Brigade could attend when called upon.</p>

<p>From 1860-1861 the Belfast Fire Brigade was under the leadership of <a href="Eyre_Massey_Shaw" title="wikilink">Eyre Massey Shaw</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> who, during his short period as superintendent, produced reports in relation to several major fires within Belfast, focusing on the inadequacies of the water mains in the city. In 1861 Massey Shaw took up the role of superintendent of the London Fire Engine Establishment and subsequently became the first chief officer of the London Fire Brigade. After Massey Shaw's departure in 1861, a decision was made to separate the Police and Fire Brigade from being a joint organisation, with George Reilly being established as its first superintendent, serving in this position until 1891. In 1892, after the retirement of superintendent Reilly, the Belfast Corporation sought to fulfil a long planned restructuring of the brigade which saw a move from a semi-professional to a fully professional Fire Brigade. Under the leadership of Superintendent George Parker, who formerly held the position of Chief Fire Officer in Bootle, Liverpool, he sought to introduce new items of protective uniform and equipment. Other major changes which occurred at this time included the phasing out of auxiliary firemen, alterations to working rotas and leave entitlements, along with reviewed rates of pay. In May 1894 the new Belfast Fire Brigade headquarters and fire station in Chichester Street opened. The premises incorporated; fire station, headquarters offices, dwelling houses to provide accommodation for firemen and their families, accommodation for single firemen, and a paved drill yard and 130 foot tall drill tower.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the 20th century, along with a rapidly growing population, Belfast required the construction of more fire stations to service the community. Between 1904 and 1905, stations were opened in <a href="Ardoyne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ardoyne</a>, <a href="Albert_Bridge_Belfast" title="wikilink">Albert Bridge</a> Road, the <a href="Shankill_Road" title="wikilink">Shankill Road</a> and Whitla Street. Developments in the motor car industry were quickly incorporated into the design of fire engines. This technology was soon introduced into the Belfast Fire Brigade, and in 1911 they were to become the first Fire Brigade within the United Kingdom to become fully motorised. This advance in mechanisation saw the demise of the horse drawn steam powered fire engine.</p>
<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>
<p>Due to the deteriorating political situation in Europe in the late 1930s, preparation was made in Belfast to protect the city against potential aerial attack from the German Luftwaffe. The Belfast Corporation then introduced the <a href="Auxillary_Fire_Service" title="wikilink">Auxiliary Fire Service</a> (AFS). The equipment and training available to the AFS, though considerably limited, proved to be an essential service to augment the full-time firemen of the Belfast Fire Brigade.</p>
<p>During the spring of 1941, Belfast was attacked from the air by the German <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a>. On the night of Easter Tuesday, 1941, around 180 German planes dropped 200 tonnes of high explosives on Belfast, and fires from 29,000 incendiary bombs ravaged the city. Almost 1,000 people were killed and 100,000 left homeless in the attack.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition to the local Fire Brigade, assistance was sought and received from Scotland, England and the Republic of Ireland Fire Brigades. On 3 December 1941 legislation was passed to establish a <a href="National_Fire_Service" title="wikilink">National Fire Service</a> (NFS) throughout Great Britain, whilst legislation was passed in Northern Ireland in 1942. The introduction of the NFS was to overcome difficulties faced by local Fire Brigades during the war effort.</p>

<h2 id="post-war">Post War</h2>
<p>Shortly after the end of the war in 1945, central government sought to disband the NFS and return responsibility to the local authority. This came about in 1947 with the introduction of 4 Fire Brigades in Northern Ireland; Northern, Southern, Western and Belfast. In 1950 the 4 Fire Brigades were formed into 2 fire authorities; the 'Belfast Fire Brigade' for Belfast, and the 'Northern Ireland Fire Authority' being responsible for the other 3 Brigades. During 1951 a central control room was established at the new headquarters in Lisburn, which was able to monitor fire appliance availability and incidents throughout Northern Ireland, thus making the Belfast headquarters control room redundant. With the continued recovery and redevelopment of the city after the destruction during the <a href="The_Blitz" title="wikilink">Blitz</a>, there was a requirement to further increase the provision of fire cover in the city. This requirement was fulfilled on 5 October 1954 with the opening of the Cadogan fire station, situated at the junction of Cadogan Park and Lisburn Road. The major change which occurred with the opening of Cadogan fire station, over those which had been built during the previous 60 years, was the cessation of on-site accommodation for firemen and their families. This development allowed firemen and their families to live elsewhere, other than on the premises of the fire station. The firemen were only required to remain on the grounds of the station during hours of work, which at this time were 84 hours per week.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s civil unrest ensued, due to the deteriorating political situation in Northern Ireland. During the month of April 1969, over a series of nights, 3 water mains were blown up which supplied water to Belfast. To augment the mains supply of water, which had been damaged, a variety of commercial businesses provided vehicles which could transport water to the city. These included milk, petrol and drinks company tankers. On the night of 20 April, 10 premises were attacked, which stretched the firefighting resources available in Belfast. The incidents were attended by 20 pumps and a variety of water tankers to supply water for firefighting, and in the words of the chief fire officer, Captain Mitchell, &quot;It must have been a source of wonderment and surprise to the citizens of Belfast to see firemen pull up at a fire to put it out with what would appear to be milk, Guinness or indeed petrol. But then the Fire Service has always been adaptable,&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="amalgamation">Amalgamation</h2>
<p>At the commencement of the 1970s, pressure was placed upon local government to reduce the number of councils, so, in consultation with the <a href="Fire_Brigades_Union" title="wikilink">Fire Brigade Union</a> (FBU), the agreed best option was the amalgamation of the 4 local Fire Brigades in Northern Ireland. From 1 October 1973, the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade, under the administration of the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, became the one amalgamated Fire Brigade for the whole of Northern Ireland, thus consigning the Belfast Fire Brigade along with the 3 other Northern Ireland fire brigades to the pages of history. George Morrison, who previously held the position of Fire Force Commander of the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, became the first Chief Fire Officer of the <a href="Northern_Ireland_Fire_and_Rescue_Service" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Fire Brigade</a> (NIFB).</p>
