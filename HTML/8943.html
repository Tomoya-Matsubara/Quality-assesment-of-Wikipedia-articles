<p><img src="Christ&#39;s_College_Chapel_98.JPG" title="fig:Interior of Christ&#39;s College Chapel" alt="Interior of Christ&#39;s College Chapel" /> The chapel was designed by <a href="Robert_Speechly" title="wikilink">Robert Speechly</a> and was built in 1867. Its simple style was in harmony with <a href="Christ&#39;s_College_Big_School" title="wikilink">Christ's College Big School</a>, which is four years older. The chapel was extended in 1884 to a design by <a href="Benjamin_Mountfort" title="wikilink">Benjamin Mountfort</a>, who added transepts and a chancel; an earlier design by <a href="William_Armson" title="wikilink">William Armson</a> was rejected. In 1888, a Mountfort-designed organ chamber was added.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The chapel more than doubled in size in 1955 based on a design by <a href="Paul_Pascoe" title="wikilink">Paul Pascoe</a>, who did not interfere with the Gothic Revival appearance of the school's quadrangle.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The chapel was used for the funeral service for Christchurch architect <a href="Peter_Beaven" title="wikilink">Peter Beaven</a> in June 2012.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
