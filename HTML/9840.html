<p><a href="image:Yellowstone_Geyser_Grotto10.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|Grotto Geyser</a> <strong>Grotto Geyser</strong> is a fountain type geyser located in the Upper Geyser Basin in <a href="Yellowstone_National_Park" title="wikilink">Yellowstone National Park</a>, <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>, in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Grotto Geyser is the namesake for the group of geysers that includes Grotto Fountain Geyser, South Grotto Fountain Geyser, Indicator Spring, Spa Geyser, and Rocket Geyser.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Grotto Geyser's oddly shaped cone, which is almost  high, comes from sinter covering dead tree stumps that accumulated as the geyser erupted. The 1870 Washburn expedition named it after this.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="eruptions">Eruptions</h2>
<p>Grotto Geyser erupts about every eight hours. The interval between eruptions is longer after a longer eruption. The eruptions are about  high and can last from about 1 1/2 to more than 10 hours long, although there have been eruptions that lasted more than 26 hours. Its eruptions are usually preceded by an eruption from Grotto Fountain Geyser.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After it has a short mode eruption, which lasts about 1-2 hours, Rocket Geyser usually has a major eruption. Approximately three-quarters of Grotto's eruptions are short mode. Grotto Geyser and Rocket Geyser erupt together. When Grotto Geyser has a long mode eruption, which lasts from 6-12 hours, Spa Geyser, instead of Rocket Geyser, erupts.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
