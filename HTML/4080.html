<p>The <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong>, occasionally called the <strong>Football World Cup</strong>, but usually referred to simply as the <strong>World Cup</strong>, is an international <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> competition contested by the <a href="List_of_men&#39;s_national_association_football_teams" title="wikilink">men's national teams</a> of the members of <em>F&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration Internationale de Football Association</em> (<a href="FIFA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIFA</a>), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in <a href="1930_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1930</a>, except in 1942 and 1946, due to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>The tournament consists of two parts, the <a href="FIFA_World_Cup_qualification" title="wikilink">qualification phase</a> and the final phase (officially called the <em>World Cup Finals</em>). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup#Final" title="wikilink">2006 tournament final</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 18 tournaments held, seven nations have won the title. <a href="Brazil_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, the only team to have played in every tournament, have won it a record five times. The current World Champions, <a href="Italy_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, follow with four titles, while <a href="Germany_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Germany</a> hold three. The other former champions are <a href="Uruguay_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a> (who won the inaugural tournament) and <a href="Argentina_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Argentina</a> with two titles each, and <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a href="France_national_football_team" title="wikilink">France</a> with one title each.</p>
<p>The <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">most recent World Cup Finals</a> were held in <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> in 2006, where <a href="Italy_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Italy</a> were crowned champions after beating <a href="France_national_football_team" title="wikilink">France</a> in the final. The <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">next World Cup Finals</a> will be held in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, from June 11, 2010 to July 11, 2010, and the <a href="2014_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2014 Finals</a> will be held in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="previous-international-competitions">Previous international competitions</h3>
<p>The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> and <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> with the first international tournament, the inaugural edition of the <a href="British_Home_Championship" title="wikilink">British Home Championship</a>, taking place in 1884.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At this stage the sport was rarely played outside the <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. As football began to increase in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the century, it was held as a <a href="demonstration_sport" title="wikilink">demonstration sport</a> (with no medals awarded) at the <a href="Football_at_the_1900_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1900</a> and <a href="Football_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1904 Summer Olympics</a>, and at the <a href="Football_at_the_1906_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1906 Intercalated Games</a>; football became an official competition at the <a href="Football_at_the_1908_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1908 Summer Olympics</a>. Planned by <a href="The_Football_Association" title="wikilink">The Football Association</a> (FA), the event was for <a href="amateurism" title="wikilink">amateur</a> players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the <a href="England_national_amateur_football_team" title="wikilink">England national amateur football team</a>) won the event in both 1908 and <a href="Football_at_the_1912_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1912</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="FIFA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIFA</a> was founded in 1904, there was an attempt made by FIFA to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, <a href="Thomas_Lipton" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Lipton</a> organized the <a href="Sir_Thomas_Lipton_Trophy" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy</a> tournament in <a href="Turin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turin</a> in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as <em>The First World Cup</em>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>, but <a href="The_Football_Association" title="wikilink">The Football Association</a> of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited <a href="West_Auckland_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">West Auckland</a>, an amateur side from <a href="County_Durham" title="wikilink">County Durham</a>, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the competition.</p>
<p>In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the <a href="Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">Olympic tournament</a> as a &quot;world football championship for amateurs&quot;, and took responsibility for managing the event.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the <a href="Football_at_the_1920_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1920 Summer Olympics</a>, contested by <a href="Egypt_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and thirteen European teams. The <a href="gold_medal" title="wikilink">gold medals</a> were won by <a href="Belgium_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Uruguay_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a> won the Olympic football tournaments in <a href="Football_at_the_1924_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1924</a> and <a href="Football_at_the_1928_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1928</a>. In 1928 FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament outside of the Olympics. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and to celebrate their <a href="centenary" class="uri" title="wikilink">centenary</a> of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country.</p>

<p>The <a href="1932_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1932 Summer Olympics</a>, held in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of <a href="Soccer_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">football in the United States</a>, as <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the <a href="International_Olympic_Committee" title="wikilink">IOC</a> also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="List_of_Presidents_of_FIFA" title="wikilink">FIFA president</a> <a href="Jules_Rimet" title="wikilink">Jules Rimet</a> thus planned the <a href="1930_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">inaugural World Cup tournament</a> to be held in <a href="Uruguay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a> in 1930. The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Rimet eventually persuaded teams from <a href="Belgium_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="France_national_football_team" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Romania_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Romania</a>, and <a href="Yugoslavia_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a> to make the trip. In total thirteen nations took part&lt;U+2014&gt;seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.</p>
<p>The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by <a href="France_national_football_team" title="wikilink">France</a> and <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">USA</a>, who beat <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> 4–1 and <a href="Belgium_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> 3–0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by <a href="Lucien_Laurent" title="wikilink">Lucien Laurent</a> of France.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the final, <a href="Uruguay_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a> defeated <a href="Argentina_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Argentina</a> 4–2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in <a href="Montevideo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montevideo</a>, and became the first nation to win a World Cup.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the <a href="1934_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1934</a> and <a href="1938_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1938</a> tournaments, with <a href="Brazil_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> the only South American team to compete in both. The <a href="1942_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1942</a> and 1946 competitions were cancelled due to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> and its aftermath.</p>
<p>The <a href="1950_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1950 World Cup</a> was the first to include British participants. <a href="Home_Nations" title="wikilink">British teams</a> withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against a foreign influence on football,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions <a href="Uruguay_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a>, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again in one of the most famous matches in World Cup history, which was later called the &quot;<a href="Uruguay_v_Brazil_(1950_FIFA_World_Cup)" title="wikilink">Maracanazo</a>&quot;. <img src="World_cup_countries_best_results_and_hosts.PNG" title="fig:Map of countries&#39; best results" alt="Map of countries&#39; best results" width="250" /> <img src="World_cup_appearances.png" title="fig:Map of countries&#39; number of appearances" alt="Map of countries&#39; number of appearances" width="250" /></p>
<p>In the tournaments between 1934 and <a href="1978_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1978</a>, 16 teams competed for each finals tournament, except in 1938, when <a href="Austria_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Austria</a> were absorbed into <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a> after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when <a href="India_national_football_team" title="wikilink">India</a>, <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> and <a href="Turkey_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia and <a href="Oceania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oceania</a>. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">USA</a>, semi-finalists in 1930; <a href="Cuba_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, quarter-finalists in 1938; <a href="Korea_DPR_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Korea DPR</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1966_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1966</a>; and <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1970_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1970</a>.</p>
<p>The finals were expanded to 24 teams in <a href="1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1982</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> then to 32 in <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1998</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. The one exception is Oceania, who have never had a guaranteed spot in the finals. In recent years, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, and those who have reached the quarter-finals include: <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1986_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1986</a>; <a href="Cameroon_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Cameroon</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1990_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1990</a>; <a href="Korea_Republic_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Korea Republic</a>, finishing in fourth place in <a href="2002_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2002</a>; and <a href="Senegal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Senegal</a> and <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">USA</a>, both quarter-finalists in 2002. However, European and South American teams have remained the stronger forces. For example, the quarter-finalists in 2006 were all from Europe or South America.</p>
<p>198 nations attempted to qualify for the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, and a record 204 will attempt to qualify for the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Football has been included in every <a href="Summer_Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Summer Olympic Games</a> except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's <a href="Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">football tournament at the Olympics</a> is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three overage players.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996, and is contested between full national sides with no age restrictions.</p>
<p>The <a href="FIFA_Confederations_Cup" title="wikilink">FIFA Confederations Cup</a> is a tournament held one year before the World Cup Finals at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress-rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup.

<h2 id="trophy">Trophy</h2>

<p><img src="Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg" title="fig:The FIFA World Cup Trophy on a German stamp" alt="The FIFA World Cup Trophy on a German stamp" /> From 1930 to 1970, the <em><a href="FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy#Jules_Rimet_Trophy" title="wikilink">Jules Rimet Trophy</a></em> was awarded to the World Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the <em>World Cup</em> or <em>Coupe du Monde</em>, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president <a href="Jules_Rimet" title="wikilink">Jules Rimet</a> who set up the first tournament. In <a href="1970_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1970</a>, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>After 1970, a new trophy, known as the <em><a href="FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy#FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy" title="wikilink">FIFA World Cup Trophy</a></em>, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer <a href="Silvio_Gazzaniga" title="wikilink">Silvio Gazzaniga</a>. The new trophy is  high, made of solid 18 <a href="carat_(purity)" title="wikilink">carat</a> (75%) gold and weighs . The base contains two layers of semi-precious <a href="malachite" class="uri" title="wikilink">malachite</a> while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since <a href="1974_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1974</a>. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: &quot;The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<h3 id="qualification">Qualification</h3>

<p>Since the second World Cup in <a href="1934_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1934</a>, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams, but also subject to lobbying from the confederations.</p>
<p>The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental <a href="play-off" title="wikilink">play-offs</a>. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone will enter a play-off for a spot in the <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010 World Cup</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> From the <a href="1938_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1938 World Cup</a> onwards,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> host nations have received an automatic berth in the finals. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> onward, requiring the champions to qualify. <a href="Brazil_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, winners in <a href="2002_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2002</a>, thus became the first defending champions to play in a qualifying match.</p>
<h3 id="final-tournament">Final tournament</h3>

<p>The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a <em>group stage</em> followed by a <em>knockout stage</em>.</p>
<p>In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are <a href="Single-elimination_tournament#Seeding" title="wikilink">seeded</a> (including the hosts, with the other teams selected using a formula based on both the <a href="FIFA_World_Rankings" title="wikilink">FIFA World Rankings</a> and performances in recent World Cups) and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different &quot;pots&quot;, usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1998</a>, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Each group plays a <a href="round-robin_tournament" title="wikilink">round-robin tournament</a>, guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since <a href="1994_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1994</a>, <a href="Three_points_for_a_win" title="wikilink">three points have been awarded for a win</a>, one for a draw and none for a loss (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three). If two or more teams end up with the same number of points, <a href="tiebreaker" title="wikilink">tiebreakers</a> are used: first is <a href="goal_difference" title="wikilink">goal difference</a>, then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining team positions at random).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The knockout stage is a <a href="single-elimination_tournament" title="wikilink">single-elimination tournament</a> in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with <a href="extra_time" title="wikilink">extra time</a> and <a href="penalty_shootout_(football)" title="wikilink">penalty shootouts</a> used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the &quot;round of 16&quot; (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the <a href="third_place_playoff" title="wikilink">third-place match</a> (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="selection-of-hosts">Selection of hosts</h2>

<p>Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The choice of location gave rise to controversies, a consequence of the three-week boat journey between South America and Europe, the two centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the <a href="1930_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">first World Cup</a> in <a href="Uruguay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a>, for example, led to only four European nations competing.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these, the <a href="1938_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1938 FIFA World Cup</a>, in France was controversial, as the American countries had been led to understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the <a href="1958_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1958 FIFA World Cup</a>, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the <a href="Americas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Americas</a> and Europe, which continued until the <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>. The <a href="2002_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the only tournament with multiple hosts.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2010</a>, South Africa will become the first African nation to host the World Cup. The <a href="2014_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2014 FIFA World Cup</a> will be hosted by <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, the first held in South America since <a href="1978_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1978</a>,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and will be the first occasion where consecutive World Cups are held outside Europe.</p>
<p>The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Executive Committee. This is done under a <a href="single_transferable_vote" title="wikilink">single transferable vote</a> system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a &quot;Hosting Agreement&quot; from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the Cup is currently made six or seven years in advance of the tournament.</p>
<p>For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the <a href="FIFA_World_Cup_hosts#2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">controversy</a> surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006 tournament</a>. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from <a href="2018_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2018</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.</p>

<p>To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by <a href="UEFA" title="wikilink">European</a> and <a href="CONMEBOL" title="wikilink">South American</a> teams. The two continents have won nine titles apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">USA</a> (<a href="CONCACAF" title="wikilink">North, Central America and Caribbean</a>) in <a href="1930_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1930</a> and <a href="Korea_Republic_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Korea Republic</a> (<a href="Asian_Football_Confederation" title="wikilink">Asia</a>) in <a href="2002_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2002</a>. The best result of an <a href="Confederation_of_African_Football" title="wikilink">African</a> team is reaching the quarter-finals: <a href="Cameroon_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Cameroon</a> in <a href="1990_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1990</a> and <a href="Senegal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Senegal</a> in 2002. <a href="Oceania_Football_Confederation" title="wikilink">Oceania</a> has only been represented in the World Cup three times, and an Oceanian team has reached the second round on only one occasion, when <a href="Australia_national_football_(soccer)_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a> progressed beyond the group stage in <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006</a>.</p>
<p>All World Cups won by European teams have taken place in Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is <a href="Brazil_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> in <a href="1958_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1958</a>.

<li id="fn39">There was no official World Cup final match in 1950. The tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). However, <a href="Uruguay_v_Brazil_(World_Cup_1950)" title="wikilink">Uruguay's 2-1 victory over Brazil</a> was the decisive match (and also coincidentally one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is often considered the &quot;final&quot; of the 1950 World Cup. <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_09a_wc-finals_alltime_8864.pdf">FIFA World Cup Finals since 1930</a> (PDF) Likewise, Sweden's 3-1 victory over Spain (played at the same time as Uruguay vs Brazil) ensured that they finished third.<a href="#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
