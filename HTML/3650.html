<p>&quot;<strong>Ultraviolet (Light My Way)</strong>&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a song by the <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a> and the tenth track from their 1991 album <em><a href="Achtung_Baby" title="wikilink">Achtung Baby</a></em>. Ostensibly about love and dependency, the song also lends itself to religious interpretations, with listeners finding allusions to the <a href="Book_of_Job" title="wikilink">Book of Job</a> and writers finding spiritual meaning in its invocation of the <a href="light_spectrum" title="wikilink">light spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>The song's composition and recording incorporate both serious and throwaway elements, in keeping with the rest of <em>Achtung Baby</em>. While not released as a single, the song has appeared in two films and a U2 business venture was named after it. &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; played a featured role during the encores of the group's 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;1993 <a href="Zoo_TV_Tour" title="wikilink">Zoo TV</a> and 2009 <a href="U2_360&lt;U+00B0&gt;_Tour" title="wikilink">360&lt;U+00B0&gt; Tours</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
<p>&quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; began as two different <a href="demo_(music)" title="wikilink">demos</a>, one variously called &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; and &quot;69&quot; (which eventually evolved into the B-side &quot;<a href="Lady_with_the_Spinning_Head" title="wikilink">Lady with the Spinning Head</a>&quot;)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and an alternately arranged demo called &quot;Light My Way&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; may have been the accidental inspiration for the origin of the band's hit single &quot;<a href="One_(U2_song)" title="wikilink">One</a>&quot;. Trying to write the bridge to a song (which conflicting reports state was &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;<a href="Mysterious_Ways_(song)" title="wikilink">Mysterious Ways</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="The_Fly_(U2_song)" title="wikilink">The Fly</a>&quot;), guitarist <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">The Edge</a> improvised a riff that the rest of the band rallied around. It was out of this that &quot;One&quot;, which changed the outlook of recording sessions for the album, was born.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the course of the recording sessions, U2 added various <a href="overdubs" class="uri" title="wikilink">overdubs</a> to the song, but <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">producer</a> <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: &quot;I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is you liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="lyrics-and-interpretation">Lyrics and interpretation</h2>
<p>The lyrics of &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; are addressed to a lover, and imply that their relationship is threatened by some sort of personal or spiritual crisis, coupled with a sense of unease over obligations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, lead vocalist <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> has called the song &quot;a little disturbed&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The song opens with 45 seconds of soft synthesizers producing an ethereal sighing, crying, almost breathing sound, somewhat akin in atmospherics to the group's early 1980s songs &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Drowning Man&quot;; during this, Bono laments that &quot;sometimes I feel like checking out.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This is followed by the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is &quot;in the black; can't see or be seen.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Each verse culminates with the refrain &quot;Baby, baby, baby, light my way.&quot; <a href="Flood_(producer)" title="wikilink">Flood</a>, who <a href="audio_engineering" title="wikilink">engineered</a> and <a href="Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)" title="wikilink">mixed</a> the recording,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono could get away with singing the repeated &quot;baby&quot;s, one of the most heavily-used clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that &quot;he got away with it alright.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the song is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to religious interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the <a href="Book_of_Job" title="wikilink">Book of Job</a> <a href="s:Bible_(King_James)/Job#Chapter_29" title="wikilink">29:2&lt;U+2013&gt;3</a> and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Robyn Brothers suggests that <a href="ultraviolet_light" title="wikilink">ultraviolet light</a> is &quot;a metaphor for a divine force both unseen to the naked eye and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of <em>Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2</em>, sees &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; as being about Bono's wife <a href="Ali_Hewson" title="wikilink">Ali</a>, and &quot;how when he feels like trash, she makes him clean,&quot; but says there is good reason to interpret the song as being just as much about God.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As such, the title evokes the image of <a href="black_light" title="wikilink">black light</a> or an invisible force permeating the darkness, whose connotations are spiritual and personal, as well as technological, reflecting themes of modern alienation explored elsewhere on <em>Achtung Baby</em> and its follow-up album, <em><a href="Zooropa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zooropa</a></em>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Dianne Ebertt Beeaff, author of <em>A Grand Madness: Ten Years on the Road with U2</em>, sees the song's narrator as longing for assistance from any source, religious or secular: &quot;This is a real plea, a bleary worn-down drained wish to disappear. A drowning man desperate to hold hands in the darkness, to have someone else point the way, to be safe and obscure.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Atara Stein sees &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; as one of several selections on the album in which the protagonist in crisis has elevated his lover into an object of worship, desperate for her to &quot;return to her initial role as his guide and salvation.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Ultraviolet&quot; is also one of several songs Bono has written on the theme of woman as spirit, and it echoes the band's 1980 song &quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot; by juxtaposing love with the image of ceilings.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> A line in <a href="Raymond_Carver" title="wikilink">Raymond Carver</a>'s late 1980s poem &quot;Suspenders&quot;, about the quiet that comes into a house where no one can sleep, was subconsciously recycled by Bono into the lyric.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In <em>Achtung Baby</em>{{'}}s running order, &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; serves, with the other two songs at the album's end, &quot;<a href="Acrobat_(song)" title="wikilink">Acrobat</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Love_Is_Blindness" title="wikilink">Love Is Blindness</a>&quot;, to explore how couples face the task of reconciling the suffering they have imposed on each other.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The song features a <a href="Motown_sound" title="wikilink">Motown sound</a>-style &quot;telegraph key&quot; rhythm, which gave it the feeling of a pop song.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This and the &quot;baby, baby&quot; refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that fit in with <em>Achtung Baby</em>{{'}}s mission of deconstructing U2's image.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s &quot;repeato-riff&quot; guitar style and the rest of the lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Bono has described &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; as &quot;an epic U2 song [but] the key of it left my voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of <em>Achtung Baby</em> and that as part of that, &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; had a &quot;helicopterish melancholy&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In <em>Achtung Baby</em>{{'}}s album package, &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; is presented next to a photograph of a crumbling <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> building that has a <a href="Trabant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trabant</a> parked in front of it.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> noted that &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; was one of the album's songs that hearkened more to the group's past than their new sound, saying that Edge's &quot;soaring peals on [it] are instantly recognizable.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Jon_Pareles" title="wikilink">Jon Pareles</a> of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> wrote that compared to much of the album's grim depictions of personal relations, &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; depicts love as a haven.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> heard echoes of <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>' 1966 song &quot;<a href="Out_of_Time_(The_Rolling_Stones_song)" title="wikilink">Out of Time</a>&quot; in the chorus of &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> called it the album's highlight, &quot;where Bono's soaring voice and the Edge's pointillistic guitar meld to create one of those uplifting moments we listen to U2 for&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Cedarville_University" title="wikilink">Cedarville University</a> literature professor Scott Calhoun says of one lyrical portion of &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;That's so evocative and works as beautiful writing away from the music. It can stand on its own on the page and, of course, it's even more effective when accompanied by the music.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Other writers have been less enthusiastic. <em><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q</a></em> magazine felt that the song was weak and that &quot;Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging up the heat from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as a throwback to the group's earlier sound, but say that &quot;the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>While &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; was not released as a single, it has appeared in other contexts. It was used in a scene in the 2006 <a href="Adam_Sandler" title="wikilink">Adam Sandler</a> film <em><a href="Click_(film)" title="wikilink">Click</a></em>, and was featured in the 2007 film <em><a href="The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_(film)" title="wikilink">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a></em>.

It was first performed at <a href="Lakeland_Arena" title="wikilink">Lakeland Arena</a> in <a href="Lakeland,_Florida" title="wikilink">Lakeland, Florida</a> on 29 February 1992 at the start of the <a href="Zoo_TV_Tour" title="wikilink">Zoo TV Tour</a>, and it remained a staple of the band's set lists for the first four legs of the tour, often preceded by a prank call by Bono as his alter-egos Mirror Ball Man or Mr. MacPhisto.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Edge played the song on his <a href="Gibson_Explorer" title="wikilink">Gibson Explorer</a>.

<p>The song was revived a decade and a half later with the launch of the <a href="U2_360&lt;U+00B0&gt;_Tour" title="wikilink">U2 360&lt;U+00B0&gt; Tour</a> on 30 June 2009 in <a href="Barcelona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barcelona</a>,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> where it was once again performed as part of the encore.
