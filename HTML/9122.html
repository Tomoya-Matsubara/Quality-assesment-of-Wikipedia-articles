<p><strong>Baden-Powell House</strong>, colloquially known as <strong>B-P House</strong>, is a <a href="Scouting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scouting</a> hostel and conference centre in <a href="South_Kensington" title="wikilink">South Kensington</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, which was built as a tribute to <a href="Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Lord Baden-Powell</a>, the founder of Scouting. The house, owned by <a href="The_Scout_Association" title="wikilink">The Scout Association</a>, hosts a collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia, including the original Baden-Powell painting by <a href="David_Jagger" title="wikilink">David Jagger</a>, Baden-Powell's <em><a href="wikisource:Last_message_to_scouts" title="wikilink">Last Message to Scouts</a></em>, and a granite statue by <a href="Don_Potter" title="wikilink">Don Potter</a>.</p>
<p>The building committee, chaired by <a href="Harold_Gillett" title="wikilink">Sir Harold Gillett</a>, <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of London</a>, purchased the site in 1956, and assigned <a href="Ralph_Tubbs" title="wikilink">Ralph Tubbs</a> to design the house in the <a href="modern_architecture" title="wikilink">modern architectural</a> style. The Foundation Stone was laid in 1959 by World Chief Guide <a href="Olave_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Olave, Lady Baden-Powell</a>, and it was opened in 1961 by <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The largest part of the &lt;U+00A3&gt;400,000 cost was provided by the Scout Movement itself. Over the years, the house has been refurbished several times, so that it now provides modern and affordable lodging for <a href="Scouting" title="wikilink">Scouts</a>, <a href="Girl_Guides" title="wikilink">Guides</a>, and their family, staying in London.</p>

<p>Acting on a 1942 initiative by <a href="Chief_Scout" title="wikilink">Chief Scout</a> <a href="Arthur_Somers-Cocks,_6th_Baron_Somers" title="wikilink">Lord Somers</a>, a formal Baden-Powell House Committee was established by <a href="The_Scout_Association" title="wikilink">The Scout Association</a> in 1953 under the direction of <a href="Harold_Gillett" title="wikilink">Sir Harold Gillett</a>, later <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of London</a>. The committee's directive was to build a <a href="hostel" class="uri" title="wikilink">hostel</a> to provide <a href="Scout" title="wikilink">Scouts</a> a place to stay at reasonable cost while visiting <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. For this purpose, in 1956 the committee purchased a bombed-out property at the intersection of <a href="Cromwell_Road" title="wikilink">Cromwell Road</a> and <a href="Queen&#39;s_Gate" title="wikilink">Queen's Gate</a> at a cost of <a href="&lt;U+00A3&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>39,000.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Scouting" title="wikilink">Scout Movement</a> raised the major part of the funding of &lt;U+00A3&gt;400,000 for building and furnishing the building between 1957 and 1959. Money was raised through public appeals supported by publication in Scout Movement magazines, a collection of donations in 15,000 brick-shaped boxes, and 5,000 appeal letters signed personally by then Chief Scout <a href="Thomas_Corbett,_2nd_Baron_Rowallan" title="wikilink">Lord Rowallan</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In a celebration on <a href="1959-10-17" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959-10-17</a> the Foundation Stone was laid by the World Chief Guide <a href="Olave_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Olave, Lady Baden-Powell</a>, with Lord Mayor Sir Harold Gillett, the new Chief Scout <a href="Charles_Maclean_of_Duart,_Baron_Maclean" title="wikilink">Sir Charles Maclean</a>, and 400 other guests in attendance. A casket was buried under the foundation stone which held 1959 Scout mementoes, stamps, coins, photographs, etc., and a programme of the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>With 142 <a href="Queen&#39;s_Scout" title="wikilink">Queen's Scouts</a> as Guard of Honour, and live broadcast by the BBC (commentator <a href="Richard_Dimbleby" title="wikilink">Richard Dimbleby</a>), Baden-Powell House was opened on <a href="1961-07-12" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961-07-12</a> by <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Afterwards, the Queen toured the house with the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, <a href="Prince_Henry,_Duke_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>, her uncle. A black marble panel with gold lettering was put on the balcony in the hall to commemorate the event.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

Tubbs' floor plans and a model of his design were displayed during a fundraising campaign and exhibition on <a href="1957-02-21" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957-02-21</a> in the Egyptian Hall of the <a href="Mansion_House,_London" title="wikilink">Mansion House</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The six storied Baden-Powell House is designed in the <a href="modern_architecture" title="wikilink">modern</a> <a href="architectural_style" title="wikilink">architectural style</a>, as pioneered by the Swiss architect <a href="Le_Corbusier" title="wikilink">Le Corbusier</a> from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a Le Corbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his <a href="Pavillon_Suisse" title="wikilink">Pavillon Suisse</a> at the <a href="Cit&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Internationale_Universitaire_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Cit&lt;U+00E9&gt; Internationale Universitaire</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Additionally, Le Corbusier's <a href="Sainte_Marie_de_La_Tourette" title="wikilink">Sainte Marie de La Tourette</a> priory in <a href="Lyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyon</a> shows two floors of monks cells with small windows, <a href="cantilever" title="wikilink">cantilevered</a> over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the <a href="facade" class="uri" title="wikilink">facade</a> of Baden-Powell House.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architecture style of Le Corbusier, he used more architectural restraint and his own design choices, such as making the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. Tubbs' heavier evolution of Le Corbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the <a href="Brutalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brutalist</a> style in the later 1960s.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Baden-Powell House was built to Tubbs' design by Harry Neal Ltd, for which they received the 1961 Gold Medal of the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Tylers_and_Bricklayers" title="wikilink">Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At the opening, the house received the building design award for &lt;U+2018&gt;The building of most merit in London.'<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Thirty-five years after its opening, Baden-Powell House was refurbished in a six-month &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 million programme, providing all modern amenities such as private facilities for all rooms, double glazing, and air conditioning, as well as enhancing conference facilities for large and small events. Upon completion of the programme, the house was opened by the president of The Scout Association, <a href="Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent</a> on <a href="1997-06-05" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997-06-05</a>. In 2002 a <a href="Starbucks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Starbucks</a> coffee and sandwich bar was opened, as well as an outdoor roof garden adjacent to the meeting conference rooms on the second floor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
