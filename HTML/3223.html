<p>The <strong>Western Ganga Dynasty</strong> (<a href="350" class="uri" title="wikilink">350</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="1000" class="uri" title="wikilink">1000</a> CE) (<a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a>:&lt;U+0CAA&gt;&lt;U+0CB6&gt;&lt;U+0CCD&gt;&lt;U+0C9A&gt;&lt;U+0CBF&gt;&lt;U+0CAE&gt; &lt;U+0C97&gt;&lt;U+0C82&gt;&lt;U+0C97&gt; &lt;U+0CB8&gt;&lt;U+0C82&gt;&lt;U+0CB8&gt;&lt;U+0CCD&gt;&lt;U+0CA5&gt;&lt;U+0CBE&gt;&lt;U+0CA8&gt;) was an important ruling dynasty of ancient <a href="Karnataka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karnataka</a> in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>. They are known as <strong>Western Gangas</strong> to distinguish them from the <strong>Eastern Gangas</strong> who in later centuries ruled over modern <a href="Orissa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orissa</a>. The general belief is the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the <a href="Pallava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pallava</a> empire in <a href="South_India" title="wikilink">South India</a>, a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of <a href="Samudra_Gupta" title="wikilink">Samudra Gupta</a>. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from <a href="Kolar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kolar</a> and later moving their capital to <a href="Talakad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talakad</a> on the banks of the <a href="Kaveri_River" title="wikilink">Kaveri River</a> in modern <a href="Mysore_district" title="wikilink">Mysore district</a>.</p>
<p>After the rise of the imperial <a href="Chalukya_dynasty" title="wikilink">Chalukyas of Badami</a>, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the <a href="Pallavas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pallavas</a> of <a href="Kanchi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kanchi</a>. The Chalukyas were replaced by the <a href="Rashtrakuta_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta</a> in 753 CE as the dominant power in the <a href="Deccan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deccan</a>. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought along side them against their foes, the <a href="Chola_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Chola Dynasty</a> of <a href="Tanjavur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanjavur</a>. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the <a href="Kaveri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaveri</a> river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.</p>
<p>Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as <a href="Shravanabelagola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Kambadahalli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kambadahalli</a>. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> flourished. 9th century Kannada literature refer to the Ganga King <a href="Durvinita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durvinita</a> of 6th century as an early writer in <a href="Kannada_language" title="wikilink">Kannada language</a> prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a> to <a href="elephant" class="uri" title="wikilink">elephant</a> management.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a <a href="North_India" title="wikilink">northern</a> origin<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> while theories based on <a href="epigraphy" class="uri" title="wikilink">epigraphy</a> propose a <a href="South_India" title="wikilink">southern</a> origin. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, the <a href="Kongu_Nadu" title="wikilink">Kongu</a> region in modern <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or of the southern districts of modern <a href="Andhra_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Andhra Pradesh</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> These regions encompass an area of the southern <a href="Deccan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deccan</a> where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the <a href="North_India" title="wikilink">northern</a> king <a href="Samudra_Gupta" title="wikilink">Samudra Gupta</a> prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves.

<p>By the time of Harivarman in 390, the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with <a href="Talakad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talakad</a> as their capital.

<p>Politically, the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas.

<p>In 753, when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan, the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> King <a href="Shivamara_II" title="wikilink">Shivamara II</a> is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta <a href="Dhruva_Dharavarsha" title="wikilink">Dhruva Dharavarsha</a>, his subsequent defeat and imprisonment, his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field. The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta <a href="Govinda_III" title="wikilink">Govinda III</a> and by 819, a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King Rachamalla.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga, Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter Chandrabbalabbe in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I, son of King Ereganga Neetimarga.

The <em>praje gavundas</em> mentioned in the Ganga records held similar responsibilities as the village elders (<em>gramavriddhas</em>) mentioned by <a href="Kautilya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kautilya</a>. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The kingdom was divided into <em>Rashtra</em> (district) and further into <em>Visaya</em> (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and <em>Desa</em>. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term <em>Visaya</em> was replaced by the Kannada term <em>Nadu</em>. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> or the number of villages included in that territory.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Epigraph" title="wikilink">Inscriptions</a> have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister (<em>sarvadhikari</em>), treasurer (<em>shribhandari</em>), foreign minister (<em>sandhivirgrahi</em>) and chief minister (<em>mahapradhana</em>). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (<em>dandanayaka</em>). Other designations were royal steward (<em>manevergade</em>), master of robes (<em>mahapasayita</em>), commander of elephant corps (<em>gajasahani</em>), commander of cavalry (<em>thuragasahani</em>) etc.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In the royal house, <em><a href="Niyogi" title="wikilink">Niyogis</a></em> oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewelery etc. and the <em>Padiyara</em> were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (<em>kote</em>) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees.

During the first phase (350-725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were <em>Brahmadeya</em> grants (grants to Brahmin temples).<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In the second phase (725-1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early <a href="Indian_copper_plate_inscriptions" title="wikilink">copper plate</a> bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern <a href="Bangalore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangalore</a> that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a <em>Bengaluru</em> war.

The Kannada legend <em>Bhadr</em>, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the <em>pagoda</em> (weighing 52 grains), the <em>fanam</em> weighting one tenth or one half of the <em>pagoda</em> and the quarter <em>fanams</em>.</p>
