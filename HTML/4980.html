<h2 id="character-development">Character development</h2>
<h3 id="characterisation">Characterisation</h3>
<p>Bridget has been portrayed out of conjunction with the <a href="stereotype" title="wikilink">stereotypical</a> 'girly image', she is sporty and athletic.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Mignon has described her as open, honest, outdoor kind of girl.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Stating that like herself Bridget had grown up with keen interests for climbing trees, cycling and swimming in rivers, non typical female interests.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She also branded Bridget as a 'sporty tomboy'.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> During an interview, Mignon said that Bridget's relationship with Declan changes her and she feels more independent from her family.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She also becomes more determined as a person.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="disability">Disability</h3>
<p>One of Bridget's first high-profile storylines was coping with a disability, after <a href="Susan_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Susan Kennedy</a> (<a href="Jackie_Woodburne" title="wikilink">Jackie Woodburne</a>) hit Bridget with her car.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> She had been paralysed on one side of her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: &quot;Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The storyline also explored self image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing <a href="physiotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">physiotherapy</a> exercises and became in danger of drowning until <a href="Declan_Napier" title="wikilink">Declan Napier</a> (<a href="James_Sorensen" title="wikilink">James Sorensen</a>) saved her.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: &quot;Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="teen-pregnancy">Teen pregnancy</h3>
<p>One of the most important storylines for the character of Bridget was when she discovered that she was pregnant with Declan's child. As the storyline progressed, Bridget was seen considering abortion or adoption, before ultimately deciding to have the child with Declan's support.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This caused controversy among conservative family groups in Australia who accused the <em>Neighbours</em> of using their chartacters to normalise teenage pregnancy.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: &quot;[Teenage pregnancy] is not something that should be considered the norm, programmes like <em>Neighbours</em> can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable. A lot of kids just aren't ready to get their head around details of explicit sexuality.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em>Neighbours</em> exectutive producer <a href="Susan_Bower" title="wikilink">Susan Bower</a> defended her character's storyline stating: &quot;I am quite sure a lot of people are not happy with this storyline. We decided we would show the ramifications on the teenagers' lives.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Mignon said that the storyline between Declan and Bridget was not shallow, trite or vulgar, further adding she would not have liked to film the storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Critics also slammed the show, noting that <em>Neighbours</em> has a G-rating and the storyline could lead to more promiscuity and teenage pregnancies among young viewers.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The storyline continued despite the controversy it caused and Declan and Bridget became parents to a daughter, <a href="List_of_Neighbours_characters_(2009)#India_Napier" title="wikilink">India</a>.</p>
<h3 id="departure">Departure</h3>
<p>In March 2009, it was announced that the Parker family were to be written out of the show after Mignon and Bastoni decided to leave to concentrate on other commitments.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Mignon, Bastoni and Coghill filmed their final scenes in April 2009.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Mignon announced that her reason for leaving the show was so that she could return to studying an Arts degree at <a href="University_of_Melbourne" title="wikilink">Melbourne university</a>. Mignon said &quot;I didn't want to defer uni forever and, to be honest, I'd had enough of the <em>Neighbours</em> experience&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <em>Neighbours</em> writers took the decision to kill the character off. Viewers saw Bridget being injured in a car accident while travelling to <a href="Oakey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oakey</a>. Bridget under went surgery and she then had a premonition of her death. Her vision comes true and she dies from internal injuries.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The <em><a href="Metro_(Associated_Metro_Limited)" title="wikilink">Metro</a></em> newspaper called the scenes &quot;tear-jerking&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>When Mignon heard how Bridget was going to leave the show, she said &quot;I was quite honoured. I feel I've been given good scope in terms of drama &lt;U+2013&gt; Bridget had a baby, got married and died. I got the soap opera trifecta!&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On Bridget and the Parker's exit, Bower said &quot;It's the story that keeps on giving for another three or four weeks. It's very well storylined, beautifully acted and shot. It's a tremendous amount of work for which we're all very proud&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Steve and Miranda Parker adopted Bridget when she was 6 years old, along with her older brother Riley.
