<p><strong>Pinnipeds</strong>, often generalized as <strong>seals</strong>, are a widely <a href="range_(biology)" title="wikilink">distributed</a> and diverse <a href="clade" class="uri" title="wikilink">clade</a> of fin-footed, <a href="semiaquatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">semiaquatic</a> <a href="marine_mammals" title="wikilink">marine mammals</a>. They comprise the <a href="extant_taxon" title="wikilink">extant</a> <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">families</a> <a href="Odobenidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odobenidae</a> (whose only living member is the <a href="walrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">walrus</a>), <a href="Otariidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Otariidae</a> (the eared seals: <a href="sea_lion" title="wikilink">sea lions</a> and <a href="fur_seal" title="wikilink">fur seals</a>), and <a href="Phocidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phocidae</a> (the earless, or &quot;true&quot; seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, <a href="molecular_phylogenetics" title="wikilink">molecular</a> evidence supports them as a <a href="monophyletic" class="uri" title="wikilink">monophyletic</a> lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order <a href="Carnivora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carnivora</a> and their closest living relatives are <a href="bear" title="wikilink">bears</a> and <a href="Musteloidea" title="wikilink">musteloids</a>.</p>
<p>Seals range in size from the  and  <a href="Baikal_seal" title="wikilink">Baikal seal</a> to the  and  <a href="southern_elephant_seal" title="wikilink">southern elephant seal</a>, which is also the largest carnivoran. Several species exhibit <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexual dimorphism</a>. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into <a href="Flipper_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">flippers</a>. Though not as fast in the water as <a href="dolphin" title="wikilink">dolphins</a>, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses&lt;U+2014&gt;their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced <a href="somatosensory_system" title="wikilink">tactile system</a> in their <a href="whiskers" class="uri" title="wikilink">whiskers</a> or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or <a href="blubber" class="uri" title="wikilink">blubber</a>, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.</p>
<p>Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, <a href="moulting" title="wikilink">molt</a> or escape from predators like <a href="shark" title="wikilink">sharks</a> and <a href="killer_whale" title="wikilink">killer whales</a>. They feed largely on fish and <a href="marine_invertebrates" title="wikilink">marine invertebrates</a>, but a few, like the <a href="leopard_seal" title="wikilink">leopard seal</a>, feed on large vertebrates such as <a href="penguin" title="wikilink">penguins</a> and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling <a href="mollusk" title="wikilink">mollusks</a>. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (<a href="polygyny" class="uri" title="wikilink">polygyny</a>), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for <a href="reproductive_success" title="wikilink">reproductive success</a> vary between defending females, defending <a href="Territory_(animal)" title="wikilink">territories</a> that attract females and performing <a href="Courtship_display" title="wikilink">ritual displays</a> or <a href="lek_mating" title="wikilink">lek mating</a>. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species <a href="fasting" title="wikilink">fast</a> and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of <a href="animal_communication" title="wikilink">vocalizations</a>, notably the barks of <a href="California_sea_lion" title="wikilink">California sea lions</a>, the <a href="gong" class="uri" title="wikilink">gong</a>-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of <a href="Weddell_seal" title="wikilink">Weddell seals</a>.</p>
<p>The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by <a href="Circumpolar_peoples" title="wikilink">indigenous peoples of the Arctic</a>, and seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly <a href="seal_hunting" title="wikilink">hunted</a> by commercial industries for their products, seals are now protected by international law. The <a href="Japanese_sea_lion" title="wikilink">Japanese sea lion</a> and the <a href="Caribbean_monk_seal" title="wikilink">Caribbean monk seal</a> have become extinct in the past century, while the <a href="Mediterranean_monk_seal" title="wikilink">Mediterranean monk seal</a> and <a href="Hawaiian_monk_seal" title="wikilink">Hawaiian monk seal</a> are ranked <a href="Critically_Endangered" title="wikilink">Critically Endangered</a> by the <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from <a href="bycatch" title="wikilink">accidental trapping</a>, <a href="marine_pollution" title="wikilink">marine pollution</a>, and conflicts with local people.</p>

<p>German naturalist <a href="Johann_Karl_Wilhelm_Illiger" title="wikilink">Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</a> was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct <a href="taxonomy_(biology)" title="wikilink">taxonomic</a> unit, and in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a <a href="Family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> and an order.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> American zoologist <a href="Joel_Asaph_Allen" title="wikilink">Joel Asaph Allen</a> reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 <a href="monograph" class="uri" title="wikilink">monograph</a>, <em>History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America</em>.

<p>Otariids are also known as eared seals due to the presence of <a href="Pinna_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">pinnae</a>. These animals rely on their well-developed fore-flippers to propel themselves through the water. They can also turn their hind-flippers forward and &quot;walk&quot; on land.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The anterior end of an otariid's <a href="frontal_bone" title="wikilink">frontal bones</a> extends between the <a href="nasal_bone" title="wikilink">nasal bones</a>, and the <a href="supraorbital_foramen" title="wikilink">supraorbital foramen</a> is large and flat horizontally. The <a href="supraspinatous_fossa" title="wikilink">supraspinatous fossas</a> are divided by a &quot;secondary spine&quot; and the <a href="bronchi" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronchi</a> are divided anteriorly.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Otariids consist of two types: <a href="sea_lion" title="wikilink">sea lions</a> and <a href="fur_seal" title="wikilink">fur seals</a>. Sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter, rougher <a href="pelage" class="uri" title="wikilink">pelage</a>, while fur seals have more pointed snouts, longer fore-flippers and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs. The former also tend to be larger than the latter.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Five <a href="genera" class="uri" title="wikilink">genera</a> and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), a 2001 genetic study found that the northern fur seal is more closely related to several sea lion species.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This is supported by a 2006 <a href="molecular_phylogenetics" title="wikilink">molecular</a> study that also found that the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to <em><a href="Arctocephalus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arctocephalus</a></em> than to other sea lions.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Odobenidae consists of only one living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the <a href="elephant_seals" title="wikilink">elephant seals</a>), nearly hairless skin and long upper <a href="Canine_tooth" title="wikilink">canines</a>, known as <a href="tusk" title="wikilink">tusks</a>. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Walruses have <a href="pterygoid_bone" title="wikilink">pterygoid bones</a> that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and <a href="calcaneus" title="wikilink">calcaneuses</a> with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Phocids are known as true or &quot;earless&quot; seals. These animals lack external ear flaps and are incapable of turning their hind-flippers forward, which makes them more cumbersome on land. In water, true seals swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Phocids have <a href="Pachyostosis" title="wikilink">thickened</a> <a href="Mastoid_process" title="wikilink">mastoids</a>, enlarged <a href="Temporal_bone#In_other_animals" title="wikilink">entotympanic bones</a>, everted <a href="pelvic_bone" title="wikilink">pelvic bones</a> and massive <a href="ankle_bone" title="wikilink">ankle bones</a>.

<p><img src="Puijila_BW.jpg" title="fig:Restoration of Puijila darwini" alt="Restoration of Puijila darwini" /> Traditionally, pinnipeds were thought to be <a href="polyphyletic" title="wikilink">diphyletic</a> (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a <a href="Most_recent_common_ancestor" title="wikilink">recent common ancestor</a> with <a href="bear" title="wikilink">bears</a> and phocids sharing one with <a href="Musteloidea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Musteloidea</a>.

Of the three, <em>Puijila</em> was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of <em>Puijila</em> in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <em>Enaliarctos</em>, a fossil species of late <a href="Oligocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oligocene</a>/early Miocene (24&lt;U+2013&gt;22 mya) <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic life with a flexible spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for <a href="Shearing_(physics)" title="wikilink">shearing</a> (like terrestrial carnivorans), and it may have stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. <em>Enaliarctos</em> was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was <em><a href="Pteroarctos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pteroarctos</a></em>, which lived in <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> 19&lt;U+2013&gt;15 mya.

The earliest fossil <em><a href="Pithanotaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pithanotaria</a></em>, found in California, is dated to 11 mya.

These primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus. Odobenids further diversified in the middle and <a href="late_Miocene" title="wikilink">late Miocene</a>. Several species had enlarged upper and lower canines. The genera <em><a href="Valenictus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valenictus</a></em> and <em>Odobenus</em> developed elongated tusks. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (via the <a href="Central_American_Seaway" title="wikilink">Central American Seaway</a>) 8&lt;U+2013&gt;5 mya and subsequently made it to the North Atlantic and returned to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1 mya.

Pups are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Pinnipeds have a simple stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a <a href="cecum" class="uri" title="wikilink">cecum</a> nor a clear demarcation between the <a href="small_intestine" title="wikilink">small</a> and <a href="large_intestine" title="wikilink">large intestines</a>; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds do not have an <a href="appendix_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">appendix</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> As in most marine mammals, the <a href="reniculate_kidney" title="wikilink">kidneys</a> are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out salt.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>

<p>Pinnipeds have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers.

Seals are more agile and flexible,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and some otariids, such as the California sea lion, are capable of bending their necks backwards far enough to reach their hind-flippers, allowing them to make dorsal turns.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing <a href="Drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a>. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of <a href="Muscle_fascicle" title="wikilink">muscle bundles</a> in their skin that may increase <a href="laminar_flow" title="wikilink">laminar flow</a> and make it easier for them to slip through water.

<p>Pinnipeds can move around on land, though not as well as terrestrial animals.

Sea lions have been recording climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>The main adaptations of the pinniped <a href="circulatory_system" title="wikilink">circulatory system</a> for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins to increase their capacity. The <a href="retia_mirabilia" title="wikilink">retia mirabilia</a> form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the <a href="thoracic_cavity" title="wikilink">thoracic cavity</a> and the body periphery.

Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have <a href="blood_volume" title="wikilink">blood volumes</a> that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs.

As a whole, they mostly feed on fish and <a href="cephalopod" title="wikilink">cephalopods</a>, followed by <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a> and <a href="bivalve" title="wikilink">bivalves</a>, and then <a href="zooplankton" class="uri" title="wikilink">zooplankton</a> and <a href="endotherm" title="wikilink">endothermic</a> (&quot;warm-blooded&quot;) prey like <a href="sea_bird" title="wikilink">sea birds</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> While most species are <a href="Generalist_and_specialist_species" title="wikilink">generalist</a> and opportunistic feeders, a few are specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats <a href="krill" class="uri" title="wikilink">krill</a>, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on <a href="clam" title="wikilink">clams</a> and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Seals typically consume their prey underwater where it is swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The elaborately <a href="Cusp_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">cusped</a> teeth of <a href="Filter_feeder" title="wikilink">filter-feeding species</a>, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by <a href="Aquatic_predation#Suction_feeding" title="wikilink">suction feeding</a>, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Some species may <a href="Gastrolith" title="wikilink">swallow stones or pebbles</a> for reasons not understood.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> <img src="Fish8426_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg" title="fig:Leopard seal capturing emperor penguin" alt="Leopard seal capturing emperor penguin" /> Pinnipeds themselves are subject to predation. Most species are preyed on by the <a href="killer_whale" title="wikilink">killer whale</a> or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large <a href="shark" title="wikilink">sharks</a> are another major predator of pinnipeds&lt;U+2014&gt;usually the <a href="great_white_shark" title="wikilink">great white shark</a> but also the <a href="tiger_shark" title="wikilink">tiger shark</a> and <a href="mako_shark" title="wikilink">mako shark</a>. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Pinnipeds are also targeted by terrestrial predators. The <a href="polar_bear" title="wikilink">polar bear</a> is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include <a href="cougar" title="wikilink">cougars</a>, <a href="brown_hyena" title="wikilink">brown hyenas</a> and various species of <a href="canid" title="wikilink">canids</a>, which mostly target the young.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines&lt;U+2014&gt;an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice to hide from predators like polar bears.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Interspecific predation among pinnipeds does occur. The leopard seal is known to prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form an important part of their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on <a href="South_American_fur_seal" title="wikilink">South American fur seals</a>.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reproductive-behavior">Reproductive behavior</h3>

<p><img src="Callorhinus_ursinus_and_harem.jpg" title="fig:Northern fur seal breeding colony" alt="Northern fur seal breeding colony" /> The <a href="mating_system" title="wikilink">mating system</a> of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to <a href="serial_monogamy" title="wikilink">serial monogamy</a>.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, and the remaining 13 breed on ice.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur&lt;U+2014&gt;all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Other seals, like the walrus and most phocids, mate on ice or in the water.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable then solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Seals that breed on ice or in water tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> <img src="Northern_elephant_seal_combats.jpg" title="fig:Male northern elephant seals fighting for dominance and females" alt="Male northern elephant seals fighting for dominance and females" /> Adult male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure <a href="reproductive_success" title="wikilink">reproductive success</a>. Otariids establish <a href="Territory_(animal)" title="wikilink">territories</a> containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural breaks in the substrate,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species like the harbor seal, Weddell seal, harp seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called &quot;maritories&quot; near female haul-out areas.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> <a href="Lek_mating" title="wikilink">Lek systems</a> are known to exist among some populations of walruses.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> These males cluster around females and try to attract them with elaborate <a href="courtship_display" title="wikilink">courtship displays</a> and vocalizations.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals and New Zealand sea lions.

<p>Younger or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephants seals will sneak into female clusters and try to blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form &quot;gangs&quot; and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with females.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate with.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> When a female elephant seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm and get away while croaking and slapping him with her tail. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to mate with the female himself.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> This behavior is also known to occur among grey seals.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Dominant female elephant seals stay in the center of the colony where they are more likely to mate with a dominant male, while peripheral females are more likely to mate with subordinates.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Female Steller sea lions are known to solicit mating with their territorial males.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="birth-and-parenting">Birth and parenting</h3>
<p>With the exception of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter <a href="estrous" class="uri" title="wikilink">estrous</a> shortly after they give birth.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> All species go through <a href="delayed_implantation" title="wikilink">delayed implantation</a>, wherein the <a href="embryo" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryo</a> remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the <a href="uterus" class="uri" title="wikilink">uterus</a>. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> <a href="Gestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gestation</a> in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> For most species, birthing takes place in the spring and summer months.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Typically, single pups are born;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Pups of most species are born <a href="precocial" class="uri" title="wikilink">precocial</a>.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> <img src="Harp_seal_mother_and_pup.jpg" title="fig:Harp seal mother nursing pup" alt="Harp seal mother nursing pup" /> Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period&lt;U+2013&gt;four days for the hooded seal and five weeks for elephant seals. The milk of these species consist of up to 60% <a href="fat" class="uri" title="wikilink">fat</a>, allowing the young to grow fairly quickly. In particular, northern elephant seal pups gain  each day before they are weaned. Some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others. <a href="Alloparenting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alloparenting</a> occurs in these fasting species;<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Lactation in otariids may last 6&lt;U+2013&gt;11 months; in the <a href="Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_fur_seal" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos fur seal</a> it can last as long as 3 years.

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p><img src="Noaa-walrus12.jpg" title="fig:Walrus males are known to use vocalizations to attract mates." alt="Walrus males are known to use vocalizations to attract mates." /> Pinnipeds can produce a number of vocalizations such as barks, grunts, rasps, rattles, growls, creaks, warbles, trills, chirps, chugs, clicks and whistles. Vocals are produced both in air and underwater. Otariids are more vocal on land, while phocids are more vocal in water. Antarctic seals are more vocal on land than Arctic seals due to a lack of terrestrial predators like the polar bear.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the females.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with &quot;clap-threats&quot; and loud drum-like calls<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> that may be <a href="Acoustic_resonance" title="wikilink">modified</a> by the proboscis.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Male otariids have strong barks, growls, roars and &quot;whickers&quot;.

They can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated throats.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>The Weddell seal has perhaps the most elaborate vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater contexts.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Underwater vocals include trills, chugs, chirps, chugs and knocks. The calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a message.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to <a href="bird_vocalization" title="wikilink">birdsongs</a> and <a href="whale_vocalization" title="wikilink">whalesongs</a>.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> In some species there appear to be geographic differences in vocalizations, known as <a href="dialect" title="wikilink">dialects</a>,<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> while certain species may even have individual variations in expression.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> These differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches.

Female pinnipeds are also known to bellow when protecting their young.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>While most vocals are audible to the human ear, a captive leopard seal was recorded making <a href="Ultrasound" title="wikilink">ultrasonic</a> calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce <a href="infrasonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrasonic</a> vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Kobe_oji_zoo_2009_April_22.jpg" title="fig:Captive sea lion at Kobe Oji Zoo, Japan" alt="Captive sea lion at Kobe Oji Zoo, Japan" /> Pinnipeds have been kept in captivity since at least the 17th century and can be found in facilities around the world. Their large size and playfulness make them popular attractions. Some exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out sites and a pool, while others have pens with small rocky, elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the California sea lion as it is abundant and easy to train.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> These animals are used to perform tricks and entertain visitors.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Some organizations, such as the <a href="Humane_Society_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Humane Society of the United States</a> and the <a href="World_Society_for_the_Protection_of_Animals" title="wikilink">World Society for the Protection of Animals</a>, object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also oppose using sea lions for entertainment, claiming the tricks performed are &quot;exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors&quot; and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>

<p>As of 2013, <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) recognizes 35 pinniped species. Two species&lt;U+2014&gt;the Japanese sea lion and the <a href="Caribbean_monk_seal" title="wikilink">Caribbean monk seal</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;are recently extinct, and ten more are considered at risk, as they are ranked &quot;<a href="Critically_Endangered" title="wikilink">Critically Endangered</a>&quot; (the Mediterranean and Hawaiian monk seals), &quot;<a href="Endangered_species" title="wikilink">Endangered</a>&quot; (Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, Caspian seal and Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos sea lion), and &quot;<a href="Vulnerable_species" title="wikilink">Vulnerable</a>&quot; (northern fur seal, hooded seal and New Zealand sea lion). Three species&lt;U+2014&gt;the walrus, the ribbon seal, and the spotted seal&lt;U+2014&gt;have a &quot;<a href="Data_Deficient" title="wikilink">Data Deficient</a>&quot; ranking.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of recent and ongoing <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a>, particularly declines in sea ice.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> There has been some debate over the cause of the decline of Steller sea lions in Alaska since the 1970s.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> <img src="Killing_fur_seals,_St_Paul_Island.jpg" title="fig:Men killing northern fur seals on Saint Paul Island, Alaska, in the 1890s" alt="Men killing northern fur seals on Saint Paul Island, Alaska, in the 1890s" /> <a href="Seal_hunting" title="wikilink">Seal hunting</a> by humans has existed since the <a href="Stone_Age" title="wikilink">Stone Age</a>. Originally, seals were hit with clubs during haul-out. Eventually, seal hunters used <a href="harpoon" title="wikilink">harpoons</a> to spear the animals from boats out at sea, and hooks for killing pups on ice or land. They were also trapped in nets. The use of firearms in seal hunting during the <a href="modern_era" title="wikilink">modern era</a> drastically increased the number of killings. Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber. The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into <a href="Fur_clothing" title="wikilink">coats</a>, and the tusks of walruses continue to be used for carvings or as ornaments.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> There is a distinction between the subsistence hunting of seals by <a href="Circumpolar_peoples" title="wikilink">indigenous peoples of the Arctic</a> and commercial hunting: subsistence hunters typically use seal products for themselves and depend on them for survival.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as indigenous people are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling seal products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term &quot;subsistence&quot; should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption. More than 100,000 phocids (especially ringed seals) as well as around 10,000 walruses are harvested annually by native hunters.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> <img src="FoA_protest.jpg" title="fig:Protests of Canada&#39;s seal hunts" alt="Protests of Canada&#39;s seal hunts" /> Commercial sealing was historically just as important an industry as <a href="whaling" class="uri" title="wikilink">whaling</a>. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s,<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> after the Canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on <a href="Guadalupe_Island" title="wikilink">Guadalupe Island</a>. It has since recolonized much of its historic range but has a <a href="population_bottleneck" title="wikilink">population bottleneck</a>.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> and northwest Africa, and remains only in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Several species of pinniped continue to be harvested. The <a href="Convention_for_the_Conservation_of_Antarctic_Seals" title="wikilink">Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals</a> allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a><a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p>The Caribbean monk seal was killed and exploited by Europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a> himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, <a href="turtling_(hunting)" title="wikilink">turtle hunters</a> and <a href="buccaneer" title="wikilink">buccaneers</a> because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus &quot;genetically tame&quot;. In the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. In the mid-nineteenth century, the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a> in 1886. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands, but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s. The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> <img src="Depka.jpg" title="fig:Grey seal on beach occupied by humans.

In the United States, pinnipeds and other marine mammals are protected under the <a href="Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act_of_1972" title="wikilink">Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972</a> (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions, which causes major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a><a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from <a href="salmon_run" title="wikilink">salmon runs</a> at <a href="Bonneville_Dam" title="wikilink">Bonneville Dam</a>.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing <a href="Oncorhynchus" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest salmon</a> populations.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using <a href="bomb" title="wikilink">bombs</a>, <a href="rubber_bullet" title="wikilink">rubber bullets</a> and <a href="Bean_bag_round" title="wikilink">bean bags</a>.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that <a href="Hydroelectricity" title="wikilink">hydroelectric dams</a> pose a greater threat to the salmon.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be <a href="Culling" title="wikilink">culled</a>, believing the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>Pinnipeds can also be threatened by humans in more indirect ways.
