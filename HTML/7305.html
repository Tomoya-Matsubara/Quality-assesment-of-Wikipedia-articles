The school recently celebrated its 40th anniversary. The school was established in 1970 to serve the young people of <a href="Derrynoose" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derrynoose</a>, <a href="Keady" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keady</a>, <a href="Madden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madden</a>, <a href="Ballymacnab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballymacnab</a>, <a href="Granemore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Granemore</a>, Clady and <a href="Middletown,_County_Armagh" title="wikilink">Middletown</a>.

<p>The school aims to provide children with a secure, caring, Christian and happy environment where high standards of learning, discipline and personal integrity can be achieved, and where all pupils are given opportunities to develop their mental and physical, oral and social ability.</p>
<p>The school has grown dramatically since 1970 when it had 450 pupils and 22 teachers to its present enrolment of 1015 pupils (including 240 Sixth Form pupils) and 70 teachers. In September 1999 we moved into a completely new purpose-built school with the most up-to-date facilities in Ireland which include a 500 square assembly hall and sports hall, sixth form suite, pavilions for Careers, Music and Drama, Lecture Theatre, Oratory and purpose-built accommodation for all Areas of Study and excellent outdoor facilities. These have been further enhanced with the completion of the Keady Recreation Centre. As part of this innovative &lt;U+2018&gt;Dual Use Scheme&lt;U+2019&gt; with Armagh City and District Council, the school now has use of a state-of-the-art synthetic pitch with floodlighting, a new four changing room pavilion with meeting room, a new grass pitch and a two floor fitness suite. The school has celebrated excellent examination results and has been included as one of the top non-selective secondary schools in Northern Ireland, for example in 2010/2011 88% of students achieved 5A*-C grades at GCSE.</p>
