<p><em>Ericiolacerta</em> was seen in the 3rd episode of <a href="Walking_With_Monsters" title="wikilink">Walking With Monsters</a>. It was shown having venom, but there is no fossil evidence to prove that.. The CGI model of this animals is actually very similar to that of the <a href="Thrinaxodon" title="wikilink">cynodonts of the documentary Walking With Dinosaurs</a>.</p>
