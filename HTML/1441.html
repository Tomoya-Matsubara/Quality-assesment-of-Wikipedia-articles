<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Grant was added to the first team squad during the 2007-2008 season by <a href="Alan_Buckley" title="wikilink">Alan Buckley</a> and was offered a new contract for the following season.</p>
<p>He made his debut for the club under <a href="Mike_Newell" title="wikilink">Mike Newell</a> as he came on as a substitute for <a href="James_Hunt_(footballer)" title="wikilink">James Hunt</a> in the 82nd minute of the clubs 0-0 away draw with <a href="Exeter_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Exeter City</a>. Normington was then given a new two year contract on 28 November 2008 by the club after impressing since the arrival of the new manager.</p>
<p>In an interview to the <a href="Grimsby_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Grimsby Telegraph</a> on <a href="9_December" title="wikilink">9 December</a> Normington commented at his relief at his chances under the new manager, stating that <a href="Alan_Buckley" title="wikilink">Alan Buckley</a> failed to help his in his career.</p>
<p>&quot;The feedback from the gaffer has been positive.</p>
<p>&quot;When the old manager was here, he didn't talk to me as much and didn't help me out as much.</p>
<p>&quot;Alan Buckley didn't really give me a chance - not even a sniff.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't even on the bench sometimes - even when there were seven subs in the cup, he named just six.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Mike Newell got here, he has been great with me.</p>
<p>&quot;He helps me and tells me my chance will come and this contract backs that up.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
