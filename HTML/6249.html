<p>Local residents said that fire safety requirements at the high-rise were lax, and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Week-long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings of the apartment complex, both of which were unharmed.

<p>According to <em><a href="Ming_Pao" title="wikilink">Ming Pao</a></em>, family members of the victims were dissatisfied with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> and the successful firefighting for a blaze at <a href="Shanghai_World_Financial_Center" title="wikilink">Shanghai World Financial Center</a> in 2007.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>, authorities halted renovation projects similar to the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still flammable, despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire, but later allowed them to resume.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>On 20 December 2010, the mayor of Shanghai, <a href="Han_Zheng" title="wikilink">Han Zheng</a>, said that the city would crack down on unfair practices of construction companies and contracting firms. Han said that there is little regulation of the construction industry and that certain companies have had advantages over other companies when being awarded contracts.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> On 11 January 2011, Shanghai authorities placed into effect a new set of regulations aimed at better official supervision of construction companies.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The city will also require that such companies will not be permitted to have any non-official relationship with local government offices after one year.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Some media organizations had been questioning the connections between Jing'an District's government and the contracting groups involved in the fire, leading to accusations of corruption.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h2>
<p>Han Zheng said on 22 November that the city was largely responsible for the disaster. He said, &quot;Poor supervision of the city's construction industry was one of the causes behind the high-rise apartment building fire. And we are responsible for that.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor at the <a href="Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, said Han was trying &quot;to do some damage control to dispel anger and to comfort the families of the victims and the Shanghai people.&quot;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Luo Lin, chief of China's <a href="State_Administration_of_Work_Safety" title="wikilink">State Administration of Work Safety</a>, blamed the fire on illegal employment methods, poor project oversight, and incompetent, inexperienced workers.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>On the day following the fire, Meng Jianzhu said he wanted an investigation into the fire to determine who was responsible for it, so those at fault could be punished appropriately. He told rescue officials to be meticulous in their efforts and that information regarding the fire should be released to the public. He also asked local governments across China to take preventative measures against such fires, including building inspections.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> A team of investigators, led by the State Administration of Work Safety,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> was formed under <a href="State_Council_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China's State Council</a> to look into the incident.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Many details about the &quot;November 15 Relief and Rehabilitation Working Team&quot; have not been publicly announced.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>The investigation into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by unlicensed welders on the tenth floor caused the bamboo scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire, which subsequently spread to the entire structure. Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November, at least four of whom were accused of being unlicensed welders.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> As of 19 November, a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> including four more who were detained that day.

<p>On 24 December 2010, Shanghai officials announced that three government employees had been taken into custody in connection with the fire. Those detained were accused of abusing their authority to permit illicit construction practices to occur. The three were reported to be Gao Weizhong, director of Jing'an's construction and transportation commission; Zhang Quan, of the commission's main office; and Zhou Jianmin, of the organization's construction department.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

<p>The fire may have been caused by the accidental ignition of <a href="polyurethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">polyurethane</a> foam insulation used on the building's outer walls.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of <a href="flame_retardant" title="wikilink">flame retardants</a>, and the foam produces toxic gases and <a href="carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide</a> when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a <a href="Beijing_Television_Cultural_Center_fire" title="wikilink">2009 fire</a> that consumed the center.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be replaced switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor <a href="fire_sprinkler_system" title="wikilink">fire sprinkler system</a> in high rise buildings.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Flowers_for_Shanghai_fire.jpg" title="fig:Mourners surrounded the destroyed building, bringing flowers and wreaths." alt="Mourners surrounded the destroyed building, bringing flowers and wreaths." width="200" /> Local citizens put flowers and wreaths near the site, and offered prayers around the destroyed building.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Mourners, including Government officials, came bearing <a href="chrysanthemum" title="wikilink">chrysanthemums</a>. At one point, the crowd stretched around  down the road.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Xinhua, about 10,000 people attended a public mourning at the site on 21 November, seven days after the fire; mourners left large amounts of flowers surrounding the burnt building.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The seventh day after death is the day that Chinese people believe the souls of the dead return to their relatives before departing, and mourners at the site burned paper and made a feast for the deceased, in accordance with Chinese tradition. During the event, the <a href="Shanghai_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Shanghai Symphony Orchestra</a> played &quot;<a href="Ave_Maria_(Bach/Gounod)" title="wikilink">Ave Maria</a>&quot; and monks recited <a href="s&lt;U+016B&gt;tra" title="wikilink">s&lt;U+016B&gt;tras</a> at a local temple.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>On 19 December 2010, the 35th day following the fire, Chinese authorities were reported to be detaining mourners who were visiting the site. According to Chinese legend, souls of the dead also visit humans 35 days after death, but police were taking mourners away on buses. Local officials did not provide an explanation for the event.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
