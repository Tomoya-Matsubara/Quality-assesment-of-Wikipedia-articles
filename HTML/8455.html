<p><strong>Dundee</strong> () is the fourth largest <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">city</a> in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> with a population of 143,090. It is located on the north bank of the <a href="River_Tay" title="wikilink">River Tay's</a> estuary and so is near the east coast and the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a>. Dundee is known as the <em>City of Discovery</em>, both in honour of Dundee's history of scientific activities, and of the <a href="RRS_Discovery" title="wikilink">RRS Discovery</a>, <a href="Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="wikilink">Robert Falcon Scott</a>'s <a href="Antarctica" title="wikilink">Antarctic</a> exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed there.</p>
<p>Its history began with the <a href="Picts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picts</a> in the <a href="Iron_age" title="wikilink">Iron age</a> and during the medieval period included several hostilities. During the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a> the local <a href="jute" class="uri" title="wikilink">jute</a> industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period Dundee also gained a reputation for its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of &quot;jam, jute and journalism&quot;. Dundee's population reached a peak of nearly 200,000 at the start of the 1970s, but it has since declined due to outward migration and a falling birth rate.</p>
<p>The biomedical and technology industries have grown since the 1980s and the city now accounts for 10% of Britain&lt;U+2019&gt;s digital entertainment industry. The city is also famous for being the home of <a href="William_McGonagall" title="wikilink">William McGonagall</a>, who is widely known as the &quot;world's worst poet&quot;. The city is home to the <a href="Scottish_Dance_Theatre" title="wikilink">Scottish Dance Theatre</a>, who are based in the city's <a href="Dundee_Repertory_Theatre" title="wikilink">Dundee Repertory Theatre</a>, and the <a href="Royal_Scottish_National_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Royal Scottish National Orchestra</a>, which regularly plays in the city's Caird Hall. On <a href="5_March" title="wikilink">5 March</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> Dundee was granted <a href="Fairtrade_Town" title="wikilink">Fairtrade City</a> status.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Dundee first became a settlement when the <a href="Picts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picts</a> settled the area 3,500 years ago. At the time the area was known by the Pictish name of <strong>Alec-tum</strong>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The name &quot;Dundee&quot; was later adopted from the <a href="Scottish_Gaelic_language" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> D&lt;U+00F9&gt;n D&lt;U+00E8&gt;agh, meaning &quot;Fort on the Tay&quot;. In 1191 <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">CE</a>, the town was awarded a <a href="charter" class="uri" title="wikilink">charter</a> making it a <a href="royal_burgh" title="wikilink">royal burgh</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This charter was later revoked by <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a>, though it was replaced by a new charter from <a href="Robert_the_Bruce" title="wikilink">Robert the Bruce</a> in 1327. Dundee became a walled city in 1545, owing to a period of hostilities known as the <a href="rough_wooing" title="wikilink">rough wooing</a>. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment. In 1645, during the <a href="Scottish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Scottish civil war</a>, Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist <a href="James_Graham,_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose" title="wikilink">Marquess of Montrose</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1651 during the <a href="Third_English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Third English Civil War</a>, it was invaded by <a href="General_Monck" title="wikilink">General Monck</a>, who was the commander of <a href="Oliver_Cromwell" title="wikilink">Oliver Cromwell's</a> forces in Scotland. These <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">English Parliamentarians</a> destroyed much of the city and killed many of its inhabitants. Dundee was later the site of an early <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> uprising when <a href="John_Graham,_1st_Viscount_Dundee" title="wikilink">John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee</a> raised the <a href="Stuart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stuart</a> standard on <a href="Law,_Dundee" title="wikilink">Dundee Law</a> in support of <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James VII (James II of England)</a> following his overthrow, earning him the nickname <a href="Bonnie_Dundee" title="wikilink">Bonnie Dundee</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <img src="Wishart_Arch.jpg" title="fig:The Wishart Arch is the only surviving part of the city walls" alt="The Wishart Arch is the only surviving part of the city walls" width="250" /></p>
<p>Dundee greatly expanded in size during the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a> mainly because of the <a href="jute" class="uri" title="wikilink">jute</a> industry.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city's workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the <a href="Indian_subcontinent" title="wikilink">Indian subcontinent</a> and of <a href="whale_oil" title="wikilink">whale oil</a> — needed for the processing of the jute — from the city's large <a href="whaling" class="uri" title="wikilink">whaling</a> industry. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city's last jute mill closed in the 1970s. <img src="Tayrailbridge.jpg" title="fig:The original Tay Bridge (from the south) the day after the disaster. The collapsed section can be seen near the northern end" alt="The original Tay Bridge (from the south) the day after the disaster. The collapsed section can be seen near the northern end" width="250" /> In addition to jute the city is also known for <a href="jam" class="uri" title="wikilink">jam</a> and <a href="journalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalism</a>. The &quot;jam&quot; association refers to <a href="marmalade" class="uri" title="wikilink">marmalade</a>, which was purportedly invented in the city by <a href="Janet_Keiller" title="wikilink">Janet Keiller</a> in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 1500s). <a href="Keiller&#39;s_marmalade" title="wikilink">Keiller's marmalade</a> became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. However, the industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Marmalade has since become the preserve of larger businesses, but jars of Keiller's marmalade are still widely available. &quot;Journalism&quot; refers to the publishing firm <a href="D._C._Thomson_&amp;_Co._Ltd" title="wikilink">DC Thomson &amp; Co.</a>, which was founded in the city in 1905 and remains the largest employer after the health and leisure industries.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The firm publishes a <a href="List_of_DC_Thomson_Publications" title="wikilink">variety</a> of newspapers, children's comics and magazines, including <em><a href="The_Sunday_Post" title="wikilink">The Sunday Post</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Courier" title="wikilink">The Courier</a></em>, <em><a href="Shout_(Teen_Magazine)" title="wikilink">Shout</a></em> and children's publications, <em><a href="The_Beano" title="wikilink">The Beano</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Dandy" title="wikilink">The Dandy</a></em>.</p>
<p>Dundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th Century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by <a href="Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="wikilink">Robert Falcon Scott</a>, the <em><a href="RRS_Discovery" title="wikilink">RRS Discovery</a></em>. This ship is now on display at Discovery Point in the city, and the Victorian steel-framed works in which Discovery's engine was built is now home to the city's largest bookstore.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The need of the local jute industry for <a href="whale_oil" title="wikilink">whale oil</a> also supported a large <a href="whaling" class="uri" title="wikilink">whaling</a> industry. <a href="Dundee_Island" title="wikilink">Dundee Island</a> in the Antarctic takes its name from the <a href="Dundee_Whaling_Expedition" title="wikilink">Dundee whaling expedition</a>, which discovered it in 1892. Whaling ceased in 1912 and shipbuilding ceased in 1981.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The estuary was the location of the first <a href="Tay_Rail_Bridge" title="wikilink">Tay rail bridge</a>, built by <a href="Thomas_Bouch" title="wikilink">Thomas Bouch</a> and opened in 1879. At the time it was the longest railway bridge in the world. The bridge fell down in a storm less than a year later under the weight of a train full of passengers in what is known as <em><a href="The_Tay_Bridge_Disaster" title="wikilink">The Tay Bridge Disaster</a></em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p><img src="Law_Dundee.jpg" title="fig:Dundee Law seen from afar" alt="Dundee Law seen from afar" width="300" /> Dundee is located at  on the north bank of the <a href="Firth_of_Tay" title="wikilink">Firth of Tay</a> and near the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a>. The city surrounds the <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a> <a href="Volcanic_plug" title="wikilink">plug</a> of an extinct <a href="volcano" class="uri" title="wikilink">volcano</a>, called <a href="Law,_Dundee" title="wikilink">Dundee Law</a> or simply <em>The Law</em> (174 metres (571 ft)).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Dundee is Scotland's only south-facing city, giving it a contested claim to being the nation's sunniest city.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Dundee's population increased substantially with the urbanisation of the Industrial Revolution as did other British cities. The most significant influx occurred in the mid-1800s with the arrival of <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> workers fleeing from the <a href="Irish_Potato_Famine_(1845&lt;U+2013&gt;1849)" title="wikilink">Potato Famine</a> and attracted by industrialisation.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The city also attracted immigrants from <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> and <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> in the 19th and 20th Centuries, although Dundee did not experience post-<a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> immigration on the same scale as other cities. Nevertheless, Dundee still has a sizable <a href="ethnic_minority" title="wikilink">ethnic minority</a> population. The city's declining industrial base has caused the population to reduce since the start of the 1970s. A 7.3% drop in population occurred between 1991 to 2001 and a decline of further 14.3% (20,674) is predicted from 2005 to 2011.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The number of deaths has exceeded the number of births since 1993, with a drop of 19% in births between 1993 and 2003.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> There has also been an annual net average emigration of 1,000 from 1998 to 2002.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Dundee attracts a large number of students (many Irish), so that students account for 14.2% of the population, more than any other Scottish city.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>
<p>The period following <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. <a href="NCR_Corporation" title="wikilink">NCR Corporation</a> selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on <a href="June_11" title="wikilink">June 11</a>, <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a>. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant, the 250,000<sup>th</sup> cash machine was produced. By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city and produced <a href="Automatic_Teller_Machine" title="wikilink">ATMs</a> at several of its Dundee plants. Magnetic-strip readers for <a href="cash_register" title="wikilink">cash registers</a> and computers were also built in Dundee.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold <a href="refrigerators" class="uri" title="wikilink">refrigerators</a> and <a href="Clothes_dryer" title="wikilink">spin dryers</a> was merged into <a href="Morphy_Richards" title="wikilink">Morphy Richards</a> and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The development in Dundee of a <a href="Michelin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michelin</a> <a href="tire" title="wikilink">tyre</a>-production facility helped to absorb the unemployment caused by the decline of the jute industry, particularly with the abolition of the jute control by the <a href="Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">Board of Trade</a> on <a href="April_30" title="wikilink">April 30</a> <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade.

Timex closed their Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six month <a href="industrial_dispute" title="wikilink">industrial dispute</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> To combat growing unemployment and vulnerable economic conditions, Dundee was declared an <a href="Enterprise_Zone" title="wikilink">Enterprise Zone</a> in January 1984.</p>
