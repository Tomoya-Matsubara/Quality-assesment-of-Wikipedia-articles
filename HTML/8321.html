<p>The <strong>Bluewater Michigan Chapter of the <a href="National_Railroad_Historical_Society" title="wikilink">National Railroad Historical Society</a></strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (or simply, Bluewater) is a 501(c)(3) <a href="non-profit_organization" title="wikilink">non-profit organization</a> which owns a large fleet of historic railway passenger coaches and operates railway excursions.</p>
<p>Bluewater has been uniquely successful for two reasons: First, an unusually large fraction of Michigan's railroads are in the hands of <a href="short-line_railroad" title="wikilink">short-line railroads</a>, which are relatively welcoming to passenger excursions. Second, they are the only non-profit organization in America to preserve a large fleet of mainline-capable coaches, and as such, their fleet is in demand by the numerous organizations which have preserved and restored operational locomotives - notably nearby <a href="Pere_Marquette_1225" title="wikilink">Pere Marquette 1225</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>Bluewater Michigan Chapter originally intended to exist in the <a href="Port_Huron,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Port Huron, Michigan</a> area; thus the &quot;Bluewater&quot; name. However they soon leased the former <a href="SEMTA" class="uri" title="wikilink">SEMTA</a> Rail commuter rail maintenance facility in Pontiac, Michigan, adjacent to the large <a href="Grand_Trunk_Western" title="wikilink">Grand Trunk Western</a> yards there.</p>
<p>Bluewater focused on railway <a href="excursions" class="uri" title="wikilink">excursions</a> around and beyond the state of Michigan, usually hauled by the host railroad's locomotives. They also loaned their coach fleet out to other excursion operators.</p>
<p>Many Bluewater members stored and maintained their privately owned coaches at Bluewater's yard locations. This proved to be a symbiotic relationship, as Bluewater was able to use these coaches in their excursions, allowing passenger trains longer than 20 cars.</p>
<p>In Owosso, Michigan, <a href="Michigan_State_Trust_for_Railway_Preservation" title="wikilink">Project 1225</a> had restored the steam locomotive <a href="Pere_Marquette_1225" title="wikilink">Pere Marquette 1225</a> and allied with Bluewater to run excursion trains in 1989. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="saginaw-relocation">Saginaw relocation</h3>
<p>Bluewater lost the lease to the SEMTA rail facility, and a search for a new location led them to the former <a href="Pere_Marquette" title="wikilink">Pere Marquette</a> shops in <a href="Saginaw,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Saginaw, Michigan</a> which they lease from the <a href="Lake_State_Railway" title="wikilink">Lake State Railway</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modern-day">Modern day</h3>
<p>Bluewater operates occasional excursions around Michigan. They also hold a monthly meeting in <a href="Royal_Oak,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Royal Oak, Michigan</a>. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
