<p><em>Spindizzy</em> is an <a href="Action_game" title="wikilink">action</a> and <a href="Puzzle_video_game" title="wikilink">puzzle game</a> <a href="Video_games_with_isometric_graphics" title="wikilink">played from an isometric perspective</a>. Players can view the playing field from four different angles, and rotate between them. The game takes place in a fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform&lt;U+2014&gt;and modify its mobility as a result&lt;U+2014&gt;between three configurations: a ball, an inverted <a href="square_pyramid" title="wikilink">square pyramid</a>, and a <a href="gyroscope" class="uri" title="wikilink">gyroscope</a>. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development-and-release">Development and release</h2>
<p><em>Spindizzy</em> was developed by Paul Shirley of British video game developer <a href="Electric_Dreams_Software" title="wikilink">Electric Dreams Software</a>. He was primarily inspired by <a href="Rare_(company)" title="wikilink">Rareware</a> games that feature an <a href="isometric_projection" title="wikilink">isometric projection</a>, but was also influenced by the gameplay of the 1984 arcade game <em><a href="Marble_Madness" title="wikilink">Marble Madness</a></em>. Shirley created an <a href="Interpreter_(computing)" title="wikilink">interpreted</a> script to generate the game's levels. The script allowed him to design a large number of stages using 11<a href="Kilobyte" title="wikilink">KB</a> of storage. The game was originally released for the <a href="Commodore_64" title="wikilink">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="Amstrad_CPC" title="wikilink">Amstrad CPC</a>. It was later <a href="porting" title="wikilink">ported</a> to <a href="Atari_8-bit" title="wikilink">Atari 8-bit</a>, <a href="ZX_Spectrum" title="wikilink">ZX Spectrum</a>, and <a href="Apple_II_series" title="wikilink">Apple II</a> computers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Spindizzy</em> cartridges were promoted as prizes in magazine contests upon its release.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> American video game company <a href="Activision" class="uri" title="wikilink">Activision</a> published the game in the United States as part of its &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; series.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> John Sanderson programmed the Apple II version; Shirley was unaware of the port's existence until the mid-1990s.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>Spindizzy</em> was later re-released as part of an Activision compilation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The company sold <em>Spindizzy</em>{{'}}s compilation rights not long after obtaining them, which reduced the amount of royalties to Shirley and Electric Dreams. Shirley eventually severed the contract with Activision, citing late royalty payments among other actions he disagreed with.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception-and-legacy">Reception and legacy</h2>

<p><em>Spindizzy</em> sold well in the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Shirley described the game's marketing life as short and attributed that to Activision's business practices. James Hague of Dadgum Games commented that <em>Spindizzy</em> could have been an &quot;all-time classic&quot; had it received a proper marketing campaign.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The game was well received by video game journalists upon its release. <em><a href="Zzap!64" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zzap!64</a></em> awarded <em>Spindizzy</em> the magazine's Gold Medal award for June 1986.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Tony Hetherington of <em><a href="Computer_Gamer" title="wikilink">Computer Gamer</a></em> listed it as one of the essential Spectrum titles of 1986.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Praise from reviewers focused on the game's visuals and design, while criticism focused on the audio. Three of <em>Zzap!64</em>{{'}}s reviewers&lt;U+2014&gt;Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn&lt;U+2014&gt;called the graphics &quot;amazing&quot;, well-executed, and &quot;varied&quot;; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <em>Computer Gamer</em> reviewer Mike Roberts praised <em>Spindizzy</em>{{'}}s gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <em>Crash</em>{{'}}s reviewer called <em>Spindizzy</em> &quot;one of the most addictive&quot; ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared to the rest of the game, but was still described as good.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Phil South of <em>Your Sinclair</em> gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>More than a decade later, reviews still praised the game. <a href="Allgame" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allgame</a> editor Ryan Glover called <em>Spindizzy</em> an &quot;innovative puzzler&quot; that prompts players to fully explore it.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Saying that the game successfully mixed infuriating moments with brilliant design, Darran Jones of <em><a href="Retro_Gamer" title="wikilink">Retro Gamer</a></em> called <em>Spindizzy</em> a &quot;timeless classic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The magazine rated <em>Spindizzy</em> the second best game with an isometric perspective, citing its presentation and stage designs.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Reviewers drew comparisons to <em>Marble Madness</em>, which was ported to home platforms the same year. Roberts called <em>Spindizzy</em> the &quot;best 'marble' game yet&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> South described <em>Spindizzy</em> as the &quot;closest thing yet to <em>Marble Madness</em>&quot; on the ZX Spectrum, while Liddon said that any similarities to <em>Marble Madness</em> were coincidental.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Many publications commented that the game was obviously inspired by <em>Marble Madness</em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Spindizzy</em>{{'}}s isometric design partially inspired Glenn Corpes during the development of the 1989 title <em><a href="Populous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Populous</a></em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Activision released a sequel titled <em><a href="Spindizzy_Worlds" title="wikilink">Spindizzy Worlds</a></em> for <a href="Amiga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amiga</a> and <a href="Atari_ST" title="wikilink">Atari ST</a> computers in 1990.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The game features similar gameplay, but improved graphics and larger playing fields.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It was later ported to the <a href="Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> by <a href="ASCII_(company)" title="wikilink">ASCII</a>, which Shirley disapproved of and considered it a &quot;disaster&quot;.
