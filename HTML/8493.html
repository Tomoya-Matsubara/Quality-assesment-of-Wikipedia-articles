<p>The park is named for the 151-foot-tall (46 m) Deeds <a href="Carillon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carillon</a>. The art moderne-style carillon tower was built in 1942, funded by Edward Deeds' wife Edith Walton Deeds and was designed to commemorate the Deeds family. When the tower was built, each of 23 bells was inscribed with the name of a family member, with the &lt;U+201C&gt;silent&lt;U+201D&gt; bells bearing the names of deceased family members and ringing bells cast with the names of family members then living. Today, with 57 bells, the carillon is Ohio&lt;U+2019&gt;s largest. The <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> listed the Deeds Carillon on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2005.</p>
<p>Carillon Park refurbished the carillon in 1988, converting it from an electric keyboard controlled instrument to a traditional, baton-keyboard mechanical carillon. The Park's carillonneur, Larry Weinstein performs live carillon concerts every Sunday at 3:00 from May to October.</p>
