<p>&quot;<strong>Pilot</strong>&quot; is the two-part <a href="television_pilot" title="wikilink">television pilot</a> of the <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> television series <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em>, with part 1 premiering on September 22, 2004 and part 2 one week later on September 29. Both parts were directed by <a href="J.J._Abrams" title="wikilink">J.J. Abrams</a>, who co-wrote the script with <a href="Damon_Lindelof" title="wikilink">Damon Lindelof</a>. <a href="Jeffrey_Lieber" title="wikilink">Jeffrey Lieber</a>, who had been commissioned by ABC to write the first version of the script, earned a story credit. Filmed in <a href="Oahu,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Oahu, Hawaii</a>, it was the most expensive pilot episode up to that time, costing between $10 and $14 million, largely due to the expense of purchasing, shipping, and dressing a decommissioned <a href="Lockheed_1011" title="wikilink">Lockheed 1011</a> to represent Flight 815's wreckage. Many changes were made during the casting process, including the selected actors, the characters' behaviors and fates.</p>
<p>The pilot introduces the survivors of <a href="Oceanic_Flight_815" title="wikilink">Oceanic Flight 815</a>, who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, <a href="Jack_Shephard" title="wikilink">Jack Shephard</a> (<a href="Matthew_Fox_(actor)" title="wikilink">Matthew Fox</a>), <a href="Kate_Austen" title="wikilink">Kate Austen</a> (<a href="Evangeline_Lilly" title="wikilink">Evangeline Lilly</a>) and <a href="Charlie_Pace" title="wikilink">Charlie Pace</a> (<a href="Dominic_Monaghan" title="wikilink">Dominic Monaghan</a>), are featured before the crash in <a href="Flashback_(narrative)" title="wikilink">flashbacks</a> of their experiences on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; these scenes set a precedence for <em>Lost</em>{{'s}} defining use of flashbacks. The <em>Lost</em> pilot is one of the most critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades.</p>

<h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3>
<p>On September 22, 2004, <a href="Jack_Shephard" title="wikilink">Jack Shephard</a> (<a href="Matthew_Fox_(actor)" title="wikilink">Matthew Fox</a>) awakens disoriented in the jungle and notices a <a href="Characters_of_Lost#Vincent" title="wikilink">yellow Labrador retriever</a> (<a href="Madison_(dog)" title="wikilink">Madison</a>) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of <a href="Oceanic_Flight_815" title="wikilink">Oceanic Flight 815</a>. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant <a href="Claire_Littleton" title="wikilink">Claire Littleton</a> (<a href="Emilie_de_Ravin" title="wikilink">Emilie de Ravin</a>), enlisting <a href="Hugo_&quot;Hurley&quot;_Reyes" title="wikilink">Hurley</a> (<a href="Jorge_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jorge Garcia</a>) to watch her, and administering <a href="Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation" title="wikilink">CPR</a> to <a href="Rose_Henderson" title="wikilink">Rose Henderson</a> (<a href="L._Scott_Caldwell" title="wikilink">L. Scott Caldwell</a>), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices <a href="Kate_Austen" title="wikilink">Kate Austen</a> (<a href="Evangeline_Lilly" title="wikilink">Evangeline Lilly</a>) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping <a href="surgical_suture" title="wikilink">suture</a> a wound on his back. <a href="Sayid_Jarrah" title="wikilink">Sayid Jarrah</a> (<a href="Naveen_Andrews" title="wikilink">Naveen Andrews</a>) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's <a href="galley_(kitchen)" title="wikilink">galley</a> and distributes them to the survivors. <a href="Shannon_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Shannon Rutherford</a> (<a href="Maggie_Grace" title="wikilink">Maggie Grace</a>) refuses chocolate offered by her brother <a href="Boone_Carlyle" title="wikilink">Boone Carlyle</a> (<a href="Ian_Somerhalder" title="wikilink">Ian Somerhalder</a>), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, <a href="Jin-Soo_Kwon" title="wikilink">Jin-Soo Kwon</a> (<a href="Daniel_Dae_Kim" title="wikilink">Daniel Dae Kim</a>), tells his wife, <a href="Sun-Hwa_Kwon" title="wikilink">Sun-Hwa Kwon</a> (<a href="Yunjin_Kim" title="wikilink">Yunjin Kim</a>), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.</p>
<p>That night, as Jack and Kate decide to search for the plane cockpit as its <a href="transceiver" class="uri" title="wikilink">transceiver</a> would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by <a href="Charlie_Pace" title="wikilink">Charlie Pace</a> (<a href="Dominic_Monaghan" title="wikilink">Dominic Monaghan</a>) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the <a href="Aircraft_lavatory" title="wikilink">bathroom</a> while Jack and Kate awaken the <a href="concussion" title="wikilink">concussed</a> pilot (<a href="Greg_Grunberg" title="wikilink">Greg Grunberg</a>) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a> and hit <a href="wake_turbulence" title="wikilink">wake turbulence</a>. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.</p>
<h4 id="flashbacks">Flashbacks</h4>
<p>On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells a flight attendant named Cindy (<a href="Kimberley_Joseph" title="wikilink">Kimberley Joseph</a>) that his alcoholic drink is not strong, and she gives him a stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.</p>
<h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3>
<p>Jack, Kate, and Charlie head back to the beach, where ten-year-old <a href="Walt_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Walt Lloyd</a> (<a href="Malcolm_David_Kelley" title="wikilink">Malcolm David Kelley</a>) discovers a pair of handcuffs, which he shows to his father, <a href="Michael_Dawson_(Lost)" title="wikilink">Michael Dawson</a> (<a href="Harold_Perrineau" title="wikilink">Harold Perrineau</a>). Afterwards, <a href="James_&quot;Sawyer&quot;_Ford" title="wikilink">James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford</a> (<a href="Josh_Holloway" title="wikilink">Josh Holloway</a>) attacks Sayid, claiming he is a terrorist who blew up the plane, but they are soon stopped by Jack and Michael. Sayid repairs the transceiver, but it has little battery life and does not have a signal. He explains to Kate that by heading up the mountains to higher ground, they might be able to acquire a signal. They decide to go inland, and Charlie, Sawyer, Shannon and Boone soon follow them. Along the way, they are attacked by a charging <a href="polar_bear" title="wikilink">polar bear</a>, which Sawyer shoots and kills. When asked about where he found the gun, Sawyer says he took it from a dead <a href="U.S._Marshal" title="wikilink">U.S. Marshal</a>. Sayid accuses Sawyer of being the marshal's prisoner. Kate takes the gun from Sawyer and Sayid instructs her on how to dismantle it.</p>
<p>Back at the beach, the marshal (<a href="Fredric_Lane" title="wikilink">Fredric Lane</a>) wakes up as Jack is suturing him, and asks Jack, &quot;Where is she?&quot; Inland, Sayid turns on the transceiver and it has a signal. However, it is being blocked by a looping transmission in French, which Shannon translates as &quot;I'm alone now, on the island alone. Please someone come. The others are dead. It killed them. It killed them all.&quot; Sayid calculates that has been repeating for over sixteen years before Charlie says, &quot;Guys, where are we?&quot;</p>
<h4 id="flashbacks-1">Flashbacks</h4>
<p>An anxious Charlie runs to the bathroom, where he locks himself to snort <a href="heroin" class="uri" title="wikilink">heroin</a>. After the plane becomes shaky, Charlie is slammed against the bathroom ceiling, and decides to leave. After being nearly hit by a refreshment cart, Charlie rushes to a seat several rows back and straps himself in as the plane shakes.</p>
<p>Kate is revealed to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, at which point the tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.</p>

J. Abrams</a> directed the episode.]]</p>
<p>The series began <a href="Filmmaking#Development" title="wikilink">development</a> in the summer of 2003, when ABC senior vice president Thom Sherman decided to order from <a href="Spelling_Television" title="wikilink">Spelling Television</a> a script based on an idea of network president <a href="Lloyd_Braun" title="wikilink">Lloyd Braun</a>, who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel <em><a href="Lord_of_the_Flies" title="wikilink">Lord of the Flies</a></em>, the movie <em><a href="Cast_Away" title="wikilink">Cast Away</a></em>, the television series <em><a href="Gilligan&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Gilligan's Island</a></em>, and the popular reality show <em><a href="Survivor_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Survivor</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 <a href="Pitch_(filmmaking)" title="wikilink">pitched</a> to ABC the concepts for <em>Nowhere</em>. Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus in January 2004 Braun contacted <a href="J._J._Abrams" title="wikilink">J. J. Abrams</a>, who developed the TV series <em><a href="Alias_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em> for ABC, to write a new pilot script. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and he was assigned a writing partner. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him <a href="Damon_Lindelof" title="wikilink">Damon Lindelof</a>, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for <em>Alias</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Together, Abrams and Lindelof developed the characters and plot of <em>Lost</em>, along with creating a series &quot;<a href="Bible_(writing)" title="wikilink">bible</a>&quot; which would store the major <a href="Mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Though Abrams and Lindelof did not use Lieber's work as inspiration for their own, Lieber's request for <a href="WGA_screenwriting_credit_system" title="wikilink">arbitration</a> at the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America,_East" title="wikilink">Writer's Guild of America</a> pointing out the similarities in both scripts earned him a story credit. Lieber would later say the series would drift much from his concepts in <em>Nowhere</em>, declaring <em>Lost</em> was &quot;more like <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">Lord of the Rings</a></em> than <em><a href="Lord_of_the_Flies" title="wikilink">Lord of the Flies</a></em>&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

He portrays <a href="Jack_Shephard" title="wikilink">Jack Shephard</a>, a doctor who is the main character of the series.|thumb|right|200px|Matthew Fox portrayed Jack Shephard, a doctor who is the main protagonist of the series.]] In the initial plans for the series, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was originally offered to <a href="Michael_Keaton" title="wikilink">Michael Keaton</a>, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After <a href="Matthew_Fox_(actor)" title="wikilink">Matthew Fox</a>'s casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The pilot wound up being played by <a href="Greg_Grunberg" title="wikilink">Greg Grunberg</a>, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose&lt;U+2019&gt;s (<a href="L._Scott_Caldwell" title="wikilink">L. Scott Caldwell</a>) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a <a href="Visa_(document)" title="wikilink">visa</a> to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to <a href="Josh_Holloway" title="wikilink">Josh Holloway</a>. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After appearing in <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan&lt;U+2019&gt;s audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

J. Abrams</a> explained more about it.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A lot of children were seen for the role of Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after the producers were impressed with his role in <em><a href="Antwone_Fisher_(film)" title="wikilink">Antwone Fisher</a></em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on <em><a href="Alias_(TV_Series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The producers were looking for someone who had a &quot;<a href="Paris_Hilton" title="wikilink">Paris Hilton</a> quality&quot; to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> She was written to be an <a href="antipathetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">antipathetic</a> character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, &quot;Five&quot;. Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but he did not want to shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Lost</em> was planned to be a multi-cultural show with an international cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable to go to the auditions, which were being held in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called <em>The Beast</em>, and was keen to have him on <em>Lost</em>. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="Yunjin_Kim" title="wikilink">Yunjin Kim</a> originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent <a href="Korean_language" title="wikilink">Korean</a>, having been raised in <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a>, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was planned to be someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. <a href="Daniel_Dae_Kim" title="wikilink">Daniel Dae Kim</a> was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a &quot;really interesting experience&quot;. He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p>The pilot was shot in <a href="Oahu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oahu</a>, Hawaii, except for the studio scenes set inside the flight, which were shot in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The wreckage of Flight 815 was made with a <a href="Lockheed_L-1011" title="wikilink">Lockheed L-1011</a> built in 1972 and previously used by <a href="Delta_Air_Lines" title="wikilink">Delta Air Lines</a> until 1998, that after being purchased by ABC was broken up and sent to Hawaii by ship.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The purchasing, shipping, and dressing of the aircraft body accounted for most of the pilot's budget,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> which at an estimated $10 and $14 million was the most expensive pilot episode up to that time.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Greenlight" title="wikilink">Greenlighting</a> such an expensive and risky project amidst ABC's low company eventually caused Braun to be fired by <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">The Walt Disney Company</a>, ABC's parent company.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>J.J. Abrams decided not to do <a href="aerial_shot" title="wikilink">aerial shots</a> to avoid revealing too much of the island, and also because he considered the different point of view could confuse audiences.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Extensive usage of <a href="visual_effects" title="wikilink">visual effects</a>, particularly <a href="Chroma_key" title="wikilink">bluescreen</a>, was used in the pilot. One effects shot was made just before part 2 was broadcast, since a scene involving a stuffed polar bear was <a href="wikt:freeze_frame" title="wikilink">freeze framed</a> and mocked on the internet, prompting ABC to replace it with a <a href="computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">CGI</a> bear.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
