It was established in November 2007 as an MLS <a href="expansion_team" title="wikilink">expansion team</a>.

The team finished the 2009 season with a winning record and qualified for the <a href="2009_MLS_Cup_Playoffs" title="wikilink">MLS playoffs</a>, where they were eliminated in the conference semi-finals.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Before the first cities in the US were chosen to host <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a> teams, Seattle was considered a viable location for a professional team.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1994, as the US was preparing to host the <a href="1994_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">FIFA World Cup</a>, more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team, among them Seattle.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle, the absence of a soccer-only stadium was a drawback to establishing an MLS team.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were also expected to secure 10,000 assurances for season tickets.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had only secured a little over 1,300.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS expansion team and for the <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(USL)" title="wikilink">American Professional Soccer League (APSL) Sounders</a> expansion team.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In a June 14, 1994 announcement, Seattle was not included among the first seven cities to receive MLS teams.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Five more teams were to be announced later in the year and to improve their chances, Seattle MLS organizers began working with the <a href="University_of_Washington" title="wikilink">University of Washington</a> to secure use of <a href="Husky_Stadium" title="wikilink">Husky Stadium</a> as an interim stadium while they pursued the construction of a permanent soccer-specific facility.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In November 1994, as the start of the first MLS season was postponed from 1995 to 1996, it was noted that the absence of an &quot;adequate grass-field facility&quot; in the area and the presence of the new APSL Seattle Sounders team had thwarted Seattle's MLS bid.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the end, Seattle was not among the cities chosen to establish a team during the first season of the MLS.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1996, as <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a> owner <a href="Paul_Allen" title="wikilink">Paul Allen</a> worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Many of the state's voters supported the referendum to construct Seahawk Stadium because it was expected to be a professional soccer venue.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> While the stadium problem was being resolved, a new issue emerged. By 2000, the MLS was moving away from league-operated teams to investor-operated teams, so wealthy individuals would need to step forward for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, Seattle was again listed as a possibility for an MLS expansion team when the ten-team league announced plans to expand into new markets.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 2004, MLS commissioner <a href="Don_Garber" title="wikilink">Don Garber</a> indicated that Seattle had been &quot;very close&quot; to receiving the expansion team awarded to <a href="Real_Salt_Lake" title="wikilink">Salt Lake</a>. <a href="Adrian_Hanauer" title="wikilink">Adrian Hanauer</a>, then-owner of the United Soccer League's (USL) Sounders (formerly the APSL Sounders), was in discussions with MLS about an estimated payment of $1 million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> When Seattle was passed over again during the 2006 season (the team went to <a href="Houston_Dynamo" title="wikilink">Houston</a>), Hanauer announced that he would not be able to secure an expansion team without the help of more investors willing to help cover the increasing MLS franchise fees which had grown beyond $10 million.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mls-expansion-arrives">MLS expansion arrives</h3>
<p>In 2007, Hanauer worked with Hollywood producer <a href="Joe_Roth" title="wikilink">Joe Roth</a> to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle at a cost of $30 million.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Paul Allen, whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field (formerly Seahawks Stadium), joined the ownership group that same year, making this bid the most promising yet.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> During the first week of November 2007, rumors began to build that the MLS would be announcing an expansion into Seattle the following week and that the ownership group had taken on a fourth member: comedian <a href="Drew_Carey" title="wikilink">Drew Carey</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In a press conference on November 13, 2007, it was announced that Seattle had been awarded an expansion team. The announcement provided a return of <a href="United_States_soccer_pyramid" title="wikilink">top-level</a> soccer to Seattle for the first time since the dissolution of its <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(NASL)" title="wikilink">North American Soccer League (NASL) team</a> in 1983. The announcement also meant that the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division would play their final season the year before the new MLS franchise was formed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Seattle Sounders FC&quot; was announced as the team name on April 7, 2008, along with the team logo, colors, and badge design, in a presentation held at the <a href="Space_Needle" title="wikilink">Space Needle</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The badge design resembles a <a href="Escutcheon_(heraldry)" title="wikilink">heraldic shield</a> and consists of two layers which represent &quot;the partnership between the ownership, the community, the players and the fans&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The logo incorporates the Space Needle, an internationally recognized Seattle landmark.

<p>Fans chose a name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and March 31, 2008. The initial list of possibilities&lt;U+2014&gt;Seattle FC, Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance&lt;U+2014&gt;deliberately did not include Seattle Sounders in order to provide a &quot;fresh start.&quot; Despite the names having been selected through fan research and internal committees, the omission of the traditional Sounders name was unpopular.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In response to fan feedback, the team added a fourth &quot;write-in&quot; option for the team name, allowing for any name to be suggested on the ballot.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Of the over 14,500 votes received for the new team name, 49% of the votes included some form of the name Sounders.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Upon announcing the name, Hanauer acknowledged the significance of keeping with tradition: &quot;The team playing at the highest level in our region has always been called Sounders.

<p>Team ownership revealed the first Sounders FC jersey on May 28, 2008, and announced <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a> as the team's sponsor in a five-year deal worth approximately $20 million.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As part of the agreement, the <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="Xbox_Live" title="wikilink">Xbox Live</a> brands appear on the front of Sounders FC's jerseys and throughout the stadium.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
