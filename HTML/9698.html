<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possess two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Self-renewal</em></strong> - the ability to go through numerous <a href="cell_cycle" title="wikilink">cycles</a> of <a href="cell_division" title="wikilink">cell division</a> while maintaining the undifferentiated state.</li>
<li><strong><em>Potency</em></strong> - the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either <strong><a href="totipotency" title="wikilink">totipotent</a></strong> or <strong><a href="pluripotency" title="wikilink">pluripotent</a></strong> - to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although <strong><a href="multipotent" class="uri" title="wikilink">multipotent</a></strong> or <strong><a href="unipotent_cell" title="wikilink">unipotent</a></strong> <a href="progenitor_cell" title="wikilink">progenitor cells</a> are sometimes referred to as stem cells.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Totipotency" title="wikilink">Totipotent</a></strong> (a.k.a <strong>omnipotent</strong>) stem cells can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a complete, viable, organism.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These cells are produced from the fusion of an egg and sperm cell.

</ul>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>The practical definition of a stem cell is the functional definition - a cell that has the potential to regenerate tissue over a lifetime. For example, the gold standard test for a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is the ability to transplant one cell and save an individual without HSCs. In this case, a stem cell must be able to produce new blood cells and immune cells over a long term, demonstrating potency. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.</p>
<p>Properties of stem cells can be illustrated <em><a href="in_vitro" title="wikilink">in vitro</a></em>, using methods such as <a href="mesenchymal_stem_cell" title="wikilink">clonogenic assays</a>, where single cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate and self-renew.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> As well, stem cells can be isolated based on a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, <em>in vitro</em> culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells will behave in a similar manner <em><a href="in_vivo" title="wikilink">in vivo</a></em>. Considerable debate exists whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.</p>
<h2 id="embryonic">Embryonic</h2>

<p><strong>Embryonic stem cell lines</strong> (ES cell lines) are cultures of cells derived from the <a href="epiblast" class="uri" title="wikilink">epiblast</a> tissue of the <a href="inner_cell_mass" title="wikilink">inner cell mass</a> (ICM) of a <a href="blastocyst" class="uri" title="wikilink">blastocyst</a> or earlier <a href="morula" class="uri" title="wikilink">morula</a> stage embryos.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A blastocyst is an early stage <a href="embryo" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryo</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;approximately four to five days old in humans and consisting of 50&lt;U+2013&gt;150 cells. ES cells are <a href="pluripotent" class="uri" title="wikilink">pluripotent</a> and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary <a href="germ_layer" title="wikilink">germ layers</a>: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult <a href="human_body" title="wikilink">body</a> when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the <a href="placenta" class="uri" title="wikilink">placenta</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly all research to date has taken place using mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES). Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of gelatin and require the presence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Human ES cells are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic <a href="fibroblasts" class="uri" title="wikilink">fibroblasts</a> (MEFs) and require the presence of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF or FGF-2).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Without optimal culture conditions or genetic manipulation,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> embryonic stem cells will rapidly differentiate.</p>
<p>A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the presence of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors <a href="Oct-4" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oct-4</a>, <a href="Nanog" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanog</a>, and <a href="Sox2" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sox2</a> form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The cell surface antigens most commonly used to identify hES cells are the glycolipids SSEA3 and SSEA4 and the keratan sulfate antigens Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After nearly ten years of research<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>, there are no approved treatments using embryonic stem cells. The first human trial was approved by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration in January 2009<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. ES cells, being pluripotent cells, require specific signals for correct differentiation - if injected directly into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of cells, causing a <a href="teratoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">teratoma</a>. Differentiating ES cells into usable cells while avoiding transplant rejection are just a few of the hurdles that embryonic stem cell researchers still face.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Many nations currently have <a href="Moratorium_(law)" title="wikilink">moratoria</a> on either ES cell research or the production of new ES cell lines. Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency, embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for <a href="regenerative_medicine" title="wikilink">regenerative medicine</a> and tissue replacement after injury or disease.</p>
<h2 id="fetal">Fetal</h2>
<p>Fetal stem cells are primitive cell types found in the organs of fetuses <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. The classification of fetal stem cells remains unclear and this type of stem cell is currently often grouped into an adult stem cell. However, a more clear distinction between the two cell types appears necessary.</p>

<p>The term <strong>adult stem cell</strong> refers to any cell which is found in a developed organism that has two properties: the ability to divide and create another cell like itself and also divide and create a cell more differentiated than itself. Also known as <strong><a href="somatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">somatic</a></strong> (from Greek &lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, &quot;of the body&quot;) stem cells and <strong>germline</strong> (giving rise to gametes) stem cells, they can be found in children, as well as adults.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Pluripotent adult stem cells are rare and generally small in number but can be found in a number of tissues including umbilical cord blood.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A great deal of adult stem cell research has focused on clarifying their capacity to divide or self-renew indefinitely and their differentiation potential.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In mice, pluripotent stem cells are directly generated from adult fibroblast cultures. Unfortunately, many mice don't live long with stem cell organs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Most adult stem cells are lineage-restricted (<a href="multipotent" class="uri" title="wikilink">multipotent</a>) and are generally referred to by their tissue origin (<a href="mesenchymal_stem_cell" title="wikilink">mesenchymal stem cell</a>, adipose-derived stem cell, <a href="endothelial_stem_cell" title="wikilink">endothelial stem cell</a>, etc.).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Adult stem cell treatments have been successfully used for many years to treat leukemia and related bone/blood cancers through bone marrow transplants.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Adult stem cells are also used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon and ligament injuries in horses.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as <a href="Stem_cell_controversy" title="wikilink">controversial</a> as <a href="embryonic_stem_cell" title="wikilink">embryonic stem cells</a>, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an <a href="embryo" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryo</a>. Additionally, because in some instances adult stem cells can be obtained from the intended recipient, (an <a href="autograft" class="uri" title="wikilink">autograft</a>) the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent in these situations. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="amniotic">Amniotic</h2>
<p>Multipotent stem cells are also found in <a href="amniotic_fluid" title="wikilink">amniotic fluid</a>. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorogenic. <a href="Amniotic_stem_cells" title="wikilink">Amniotic stem cells</a> are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="induced-pluripotent">Induced pluripotent</h2>

<p>These are not adult stem cells, but rather reprogrammed cells (e.g. epithelial cells) given pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein <a href="transcription_factors" title="wikilink">transcription factors</a>, pluripotent stem cells equivalent to <a href="embryonic_stem_cells" title="wikilink">embryonic stem cells</a> have been derived from human adult skin tissue.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at <a href="Kyoto_University" title="wikilink">Kyoto University</a> used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> in their experiments on cells from human faces. <a href="Junying_Yu" title="wikilink">Junying Yu</a>, <a href="James_Thomson_(cell_biologist)" title="wikilink">James Thomson</a>, and their colleagues at the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison</a> used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and carried out their experiments using cells from human <a href="foreskin" class="uri" title="wikilink">foreskin</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of the success of these experiments, <a href="Ian_Wilmut" title="wikilink">Ian Wilmut</a>, who helped create the first cloned animal <a href="Dolly_the_Sheep" title="wikilink">Dolly the Sheep</a>, has announced that he will abandon <a href="nuclear_transfer" title="wikilink">nuclear transfer</a> as an avenue of research.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="lineage">Lineage</h2>

<p>To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see <em>Stem cell division and differentiation</em> diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a <a href="progenitor_cell" title="wikilink">progenitor cell</a> with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally <a href="cell_differentiation" title="wikilink">differentiating</a> into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as <a href="Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">receptors</a>) between the daughter cells.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in <em>Drosophila</em> germarium have identified the signals dpp and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>The signals that lead to reprogramming of cells to an embryonic-like state are also being investigated. These signal pathways include several <a href="transcription_factor" title="wikilink">transcription factors</a> including the <a href="oncogene" class="uri" title="wikilink">oncogene</a> <a href="Myc" title="wikilink">c-Myc</a>. Initial studies indicate that transformation of mice cells with a combination of these anti-differentiation signals can reverse differentiation and may allow adult cells to become pluripotent.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, the need to transform these cells with an oncogene may prevent the use of this approach in therapy.</p>
<p>Challenging the terminal nature of cellular differentiation and the integrity of lineage commitment, it was recently determined that the somatic expression of combined <a href="transcription_factor" title="wikilink">transcription factors</a> can directly induce other defined somatic cell fates; researchers identified three neural-lineage-specific transcription factors that could directly convert mouse <a href="fibroblasts" class="uri" title="wikilink">fibroblasts</a> (skin cells) into fully-functional <a href="neuron" title="wikilink">neurons</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>. This &quot;induced neurons&quot; (iN) cell research inspires the researchers to induce other cell types <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> implies that <i>all</i> cells are <a href="totipotent" class="uri" title="wikilink">totipotent</a>: with the proper tools, all cells may form all kinds of tissue.</p>

<p>Medical researchers believe that stem cell therapy has the potential to dramatically change the treatment of human disease.

<p>Opponents of the research argue that embryonic stem cell technologies are a <a href="slippery_slope" title="wikilink">slippery slope</a> to <a href="reproductive_cloning" title="wikilink">reproductive cloning</a> and can fundamentally devalue human life.

<p>Contrarily, supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that such research should be pursued because the resultant treatments could have significant medical potential. It is also noted that excess embryos created for <a href="invitro_fertilization" title="wikilink">in vitro fertilization</a> could be donated with consent and used for the research.</p>

<p>The <a href="patent" title="wikilink">patents</a> covering a lot of work on human embryonic stem cells are owned by the <a href="Wisconsin_Alumni_Research_Foundation" title="wikilink">Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation</a> (WARF). WARF does not charge academics to study human stem cells but does charge commercial users. WARF sold <a href="Geron_Corp." title="wikilink">Geron Corp.</a> exclusive rights to work on human stem cells but later sued Geron Corp. to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron Corp. would keep the rights to only three cell types. In 2001, WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>These patents are now in doubt as a request for review by the <a href="US_Patent_and_Trademark_Office" title="wikilink">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> has been filed by non-profit patent-watchdogs <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/">The Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights</a> and the <a href="Public_Patent_Foundation" title="wikilink">Public Patent Foundation</a> as well as molecular biologist Jeanne Loring of the Burnham Institute. According to them, two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1993 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge states that these techniques, developed by <a href="James_Thomson_(cell_biologist)" title="wikilink">James A. Thomson</a>, are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.</p>
<p>The outcome of this legal challenge is particularly relevant to the Geron Corp. as it can only license patents that are upheld.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
