<p>The <strong>Peasants' Revolt</strong>, also called <strong>Wat Tyler's Rebellion</strong> or the <strong>Great Rising</strong>, was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the economic and political tensions generated by the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the <a href="Hundred_Years_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years War</a>, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a> on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid <a href="poll_tax" title="wikilink">poll taxes</a> in the town of <a href="Brentwood,_Essex" title="wikilink">Brentwood</a> ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of unfree labour known as <a href="serfdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">serfdom</a> and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.</p>
<p>Inspired by the sermons of the <a href="Christian_radicalism" title="wikilink">radical</a> cleric <a href="John_Ball_(priest)" title="wikilink">John Ball</a>, and led by <a href="Wat_Tyler" title="wikilink">Wat Tyler</a>, a contingent of <a href="Kent" title="wikilink">Kentish</a> rebels advanced on London. They were met at <a href="Blackheath,_London" title="wikilink">Blackheath</a> by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King <a href="Richard_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard II</a>, then aged only 14, retreated to the safety of the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="wikilink">Tower of London</a>, but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the <a href="Savoy_Palace" title="wikilink">Savoy Palace</a> and <a href="Temple,_London" title="wikilink">the Temple</a> <a href="Inns_of_Court" title="wikilink">Inns of Court</a>, set fire to law books and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at <a href="Mile_End" title="wikilink">Mile End</a> and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the <a href="Simon_Sudbury" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a> and the <a href="Robert_Hales" title="wikilink">Lord High Treasurer</a>, whom they found inside.</p>
<p>On 15 June Richard left the city to meet with Tyler and the rebels at <a href="Smithfield,_London" title="wikilink">Smithfield</a>. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, <a href="William_Walworth" title="wikilink">William Walworth</a>, to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into <a href="East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglia</a>, where the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a> was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of <a href="Henry_le_Despenser" title="wikilink">Henry le Despenser</a>, who defeated a rebel army at the <a href="Battle_of_North_Walsham" title="wikilink">Battle of North Walsham</a> on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to the cities of <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a>, <a href="Beverley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beverley</a> and <a href="Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Scarborough</a>, and west as far as <a href="Bridgwater" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bridgwater</a> in <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>. Richard mobilised around 4,000 soldiers to help restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.</p>
<p>The Peasants' Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary <a href="chroniclers" class="uri" title="wikilink">chroniclers</a> to assemble an account of the uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. Once seen as a defining moment in English history, modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in <a href="socialist_literature" title="wikilink">socialist literature</a>, including by the author <a href="William_Morris" title="wikilink">William Morris</a>, and remains a potent political symbol for the <a href="Left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">political left</a>, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the <a href="Community_Charge" title="wikilink">Community Charge</a> in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.</p>

<p>In 1348 a plague known as the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> crossed from Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to the changed economic situation.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The authorities responded to the chaos with emergency legislation, the <a href="Ordinance_of_Labourers_1349" title="wikilink">Ordinance of Labourers</a>, passed in 1349, and the <a href="Statute_of_Labourers_1351" title="wikilink">Statute of Labourers</a> of 1351.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The system was initially enforced through special <a href="Judicial_officer" title="wikilink">Justices</a> of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal <a href="Justice_of_the_Peace" title="wikilink">Justices of the Peace</a>, typically members of the local gentry.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking additional wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include <a href="Human_branding" title="wikilink">branding</a> and imprisonment.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The royal government had not intervened in this way before, or allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range of opportunities for farmers and artisans.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in <a href="Statute_Concerning_Diet_and_Apparel_1363" title="wikilink">fresh laws in 1363</a> to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These <a href="sumptuary_law" title="wikilink">sumptuary laws</a> proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="war-and-finance">War and finance</h3>
<p>Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the management of the war with France. In 1337 <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III of England</a> had pressed <a href="British_claims_to_the_French_throne" title="wikilink">his claims to the French throne</a>, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the <a href="Hundred_Years_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years War</a>. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. <a href="Charles_V_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles V of France</a> became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in <a href="Calais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calais</a> and <a href="Brest,_France" title="wikilink">Brest</a> alone, for example, were costing &lt;U+00A3&gt;36,000 a year to support, while military expeditions could consume &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000 in only six months.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th century and modern prices or incomes.

<p>Richard's government was formed around his uncles, most prominently the rich and powerful <a href="John_of_Gaunt" title="wikilink">John of Gaunt</a>, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis through Parliament, then comprising the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">Lords</a>, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_England" title="wikilink">Commons</a>, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> To exacerbate matters, the official statistics used to administrate the taxes predated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities no longer bore much resemblance to the pre-plague figures, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Just before Edward's death, Parliament introduced a new form of taxation called the <a href="poll_tax" title="wikilink">poll tax</a>, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|For comparison, the wage for an unskilled labourer in Essex in 1380 was around three pence a day.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised &lt;U+00A3&gt;22,000.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Tax evasion proved to be a problem, and it only raised &lt;U+00A3&gt;18,600, much less than the &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000 that had been hoped for.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1380, Parliament was called together again in <a href="Northampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northampton</a>. Archbishop <a href="Simon_Sudbury" title="wikilink">Simon Sudbury</a>, the new <a href="Lord_Chancellor_of_England" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, and the risk of the Crown having to default on its debts.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The Commons were told that the colossal sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Parliament passed a third poll tax, this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples, which they estimated would raise &lt;U+00A3&gt;66,666.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the fresh taxes.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>Rural communities, particularly in the south-east, were unhappy with the operation of serfdom and the use of the local manorial courts to exact traditional fines and levies, not least because the same landowners who were running these courts also often acted as enforcers of the unpopular labour laws or as royal judges.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Many of the village elites refused to take up positions in local government and began to frustrate the operation of the courts.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Animals seized by the courts began to be &quot;rescued&quot; by their owners, and legal officials were assaulted.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Some started to advocate the creation of independent village communities, respecting traditional laws but separate from the hated legal system centred in London.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> As the historian <a href="Miri_Rubin" title="wikilink">Miri Rubin</a> describes, for many, &quot;the problem was not the country's laws, but those charged with applying and safeguarding them&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>The rural rebels came from a wide range of backgrounds, but typically they were, as the historian Christopher Dyer describes, &quot;people well below the ranks of the gentry, but who mainly held some land and goods&quot;, and not the very poorest in society, who formed a minority of the rebel movement.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> Many had held positions of authority in local village governance, and these seem to have provided leadership to the revolt.<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> Some were artisans, including, as the historian Rodney Hilton lists, &quot;carpenters, sawyers, masons, cobblers, tailors, weavers, fullers, glovers, hosiers, skinners, bakers, butchers, innkeepers, cooks and a lime-burner&quot;.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> They were predominantly male, but with some women in their ranks.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> The rebels were typically illiterate; only between 5 and 15 per cent of England could read during this period.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> They also came from a broad range of local communities, including at least 330 south-eastern villages.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of the rebels had urban backgrounds, and the majority of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain at the expense of the local elites.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> Alternatively, some urban rebels were themselves part of that elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a></p>

<p>The revolt formed the basis for the late 16th-century play, <em><a href="The_Life_and_Death_of_Jack_Straw" title="wikilink">The Life and Death of Jack Straw</a></em>, possibly written by <a href="George_Peele" title="wikilink">George Peele</a> and probably originally designed for production in the city's guild pageants.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> It portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by John Ball, making clear political links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the 14th century.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a> The story of the revolt was used in pamphlets during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a> of the 17th century, and formed part of <a href="John_Cleveland" title="wikilink">John Cleveland</a>'s early history of the war.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> It was deployed as a cautionary account in political speeches during the 18th century, and a <a href="chapbook" class="uri" title="wikilink">chapbook</a> entitled <em>The History of Wat Tyler and Jack Strawe</em> proved popular during the <a href="Jacobite_risings" title="wikilink">Jacobite risings</a> and <a href="American_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">American War of Independence</a>.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Paine" title="wikilink">Thomas Paine</a> and <a href="Edmund_Burke" title="wikilink">Edmund Burke</a> argued over the lessons to be drawn from the revolt, Paine expressing sympathy for the rebels and Burke condemning the violence.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> The <a href="Romantic_poetry" title="wikilink">Romantic poet</a> <a href="Robert_Southey" title="wikilink">Robert Southey</a> based his 1794 play <em>Wat Tyler</em> on the events, taking a radical and pro-rebel perspective.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a></p>
<p>As the historian Michael Postan describes, the revolt became famous &quot;as a landmark in social development and [as] a typical instance of working-class revolt against oppression&quot;, and was widely used in 19th and 20th century <a href="socialist_literature" title="wikilink">socialist literature</a>.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a> <a href="William_Morris" title="wikilink">William Morris</a> built on Chaucer in his novel <em><a href="A_Dream_of_John_Ball" title="wikilink">A Dream of John Ball</a></em>, published in 1888, creating a narrator who was openly sympathetic to the peasant cause, albeit a 19th-century persona, taken back to the 14th century via way of a dream.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> The story ends with a prophecy that socialist ideals will one day be successful.<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> In turn, this representation of the revolt influenced Morris's <a href="utopian_socialism" title="wikilink">utopian socialist</a> <em><a href="News_from_Nowhere" title="wikilink">News from Nowhere</a></em>.<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> <a href="Florence_Converse" title="wikilink">Florence Converse</a> used the revolt in her novel <em>Long Will</em> in 1903.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a> Later 20th century socialists continued to draw parallels between the revolt and contemporary political struggles, including during the arguments over the introduction of the <a href="Community_Charge" title="wikilink">Community Charge</a> in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a></p>
<p>The events of 1381 have also attracted interest from <a href="Conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy theorists</a>, including writer <a href="John_J._Robinson" title="wikilink">John Robinson</a>, who have attempted to explain alleged flaws in mainstream historical accounts of the revolt, such as the speed with which the rebellion was coordinated.<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"><sup>368</sup></a> Theories include that that revolt was in fact led by a secret, <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a> organisation called &quot;the Great Society&quot;, said to be an offshoot of the order of the <a href="Knights_Templar" title="wikilink">Knights Templar</a> destroyed in 1312, or that the fraternity of the <a href="Freemasons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freemasons</a> was covertly involved in organising the revolt.<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The term &quot;the Great Society&quot; emerges from indictments against the rebels, in which references were made the <em>magne societatis</em>. This probably meant &quot;large company&quot; or &quot;great band&quot; of rebels, but was mistranslated in the late 19th century to refer to the &quot;Great Society&quot;.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>
