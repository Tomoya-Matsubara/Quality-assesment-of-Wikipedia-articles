<p>The <strong>Wrest Point Hotel Casino</strong> was Australia's first legal <a href="casino" class="uri" title="wikilink">casino</a>, opening in the suburb of <a href="Sandy_Bay,_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Sandy Bay</a> in <a href="Hobart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hobart</a>, <a href="Tasmania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a>, on <a href="10_February" title="wikilink">10 February</a> <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a>. <img src="Wrest-Point-Hotel-Casino.jpg" title="fig:Wrest Point Hotel Casino" alt="Wrest Point Hotel Casino" width="290" /></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The site was originally a hotel that was called the <em>Wrest Point Riviera</em>, built by <a href="Arthur_Drysdale" title="wikilink">Arthur Drysdale</a> and opened in <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>. The hotel was later sold to <a href="Federal_Group" title="wikilink">Federal Hotels</a>, who remain the present owners.</p>
<p>In the <a href="1960s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960s</a>, The Federal Group attempted to secure Australia's first casino license. At the time, Tasmania's natural scenery and beauty were not widely known elsewhere, and as a result the state wasn't attracting many tourists. The company hoped that a casino would be the drawcard that would kickstart Tasmania's tourism industry.</p>
<p>One of the company's executives, John Haddad (now the Managing Director), was assigned the role of getting a casino license. He met with then <a href="Premier_of_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Tasmanian Premier</a> <a href="Eric_Reece" title="wikilink">Eric Reece</a> and other state officials. A referendum was called, and narrowly passed.</p>
<p>The development of the casino included the construction of the 17-storey hotel tower, a landmark that is nationally idenitified with Hobart, and <a href="as_of_2006" title="wikilink">to this day</a> is still the city's tallest building.</p>
<p>After the centre's opening in 1973 (after which it was known as <em>Wrest Point Hotel Casino</em>) the casino kickstarted the nation's casino industry, with 12 additional casinos opening across the country. This included a second Federal Group casino in Tasmania, the <a href="Country_Club_Resort" title="wikilink">Country Club Resort</a>, which opened in <a href="Launceston,_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Launceston</a> in <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a>.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the casino, the state's tourism industry has boomed, as its management had hoped.</p>
<p>The building has been extended in recent years, including the conference centre which was opened in <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>, and the boardwalk in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>.</p>
