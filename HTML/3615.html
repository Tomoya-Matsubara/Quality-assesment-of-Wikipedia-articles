<p><strong>Nikita</strong> is the primary protagonist and eponymous character of <em><a href="Nikita_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Nikita</a></em>, an American action and drama television series, which debuted in September 2010 on <a href="The_CW_Television_Network" title="wikilink">The CW Television Network</a>. She is played by American actress <a href="Maggie_Q" title="wikilink">Maggie Q</a>. The series follows Nikita's efforts in bringing down Division, a secret agency that trained her into becoming an agent and assassin, and then betrayed her by killing a man she fell in love with, civilian Daniel Monroe. She recruits <a href="Alexandra_Udinov" title="wikilink">Alexandra Udinov</a> (<a href="Lyndsy_Fonseca" title="wikilink">Lyndsy Fonseca</a>) into helping her destroy Division from within.</p>
<p>Q was in talks to appear on the series as the title character in February 2010, and it was her first time working on a television series. She was chosen for the role because series creator Craig Silverstein believed Q had qualities that would fit the character; &quot;beautiful, who could fight,&quot; and be believable with a gun. The actress meanwhile was intrigued by the <a href="Nikita_(film)" title="wikilink">original <em>Nikita</em> film</a> and <a href="Luc_Besson" title="wikilink">Luc Besson</a>'s creation of a flawed female character. Q performs her own stunts of the series. The series also deals with Nikita and <a href="Michael_(Nikita)" title="wikilink">Michael</a>'s romantic tension, then relationship, described by the fans as &quot;Mikita.&quot; The character and Q's portrayal garnered generally positive reactions from critics.</p>

<p>Nikita was once a felonious <a href="Substance_dependence" title="wikilink">drug addicted</a> teenager. After she was <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">sentenced to death</a>, Nikita was brought in by Division, a secret American agency who faked her execution and agent <a href="Michael_(Nikita)" title="wikilink">Michael</a> (<a href="Shane_West" title="wikilink">Shane West</a>) started training her to be an <a href="assassination" title="wikilink">assassin</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nikita's first kill assignment was Victor Han (<a href="Russel_Wong" title="wikilink">Russel Wong</a>). However, unknown to her at the time Han contacted Division to fake his death to cover up his involvement with a <a href="Triad_(underground_society)" title="wikilink">triad</a> gang.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Later Nikita began a relationship with civilian Daniel Monroe (<a href="Sebastien_Roberts" title="wikilink">Sebastien Roberts</a>). Because this was against Division's policy&lt;U+2014&gt;Division could not allow Nikita to be distracted with emotional entanglements&lt;U+2014&gt;they killed him.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Seeking revenge, Nikita went rogue and would spend the next three years working on a plan to bring down Division.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Nikita recruits <a href="Alexandra_Udinov" title="wikilink">Alexandra Udinov</a> (<a href="Lyndsy_Fonseca" title="wikilink">Lyndsy Fonseca</a>) after saving her from drug dealers, and started training her in bringing down Division from the inside.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In the pilot episode Nikita and Alex gets Division's attention by setting up a robbery where Alex would be arrested for the <a href="murder" class="uri" title="wikilink">murder</a> of a man Division was after. From there Alex would assist Nikita by warning her of several Division operations so that Nikita can sabotage them.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In &quot;The Guardian&quot; Nikita reluctantly takes Owen Elliot (<a href="Devon_Sawa" title="wikilink">Devon Sawa</a>), Monroe's killer, as an ally; Elliot is a guardian to one of seven black boxes, <a href="hard_drive" title="wikilink">hard drives</a> with information on Division's past assignments.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> She would later plan on finding all of Division's black boxes to destroy them.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In &quot;Phoenix&quot; Nikita is offered a position in Gogol, a terrorist organization who also wish to destroy Division, but she declines.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In &quot;One Way&quot; she aids a reluctant Michael in killing Kasim Tariq (<a href="Haaz_Sleiman" title="wikilink">Haaz Sleiman</a>) in <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, a terrorist responsible for killing Michael's family.

She is also captured by Division, thought Alex would detonate several bombs as a distraction to allow Nikita to escape.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Later Michael discovers the location of Nikita's hideout and discovers that Alex is her mole in stopping Division.

However, Birkhoff has helped Nikita hack into one of the black boxes, saying he will &quot;cross [his fingers] behind [his] back&quot; to help her. By the end of the first season, Michael and Nikita then end up on the run together to find the remaining black boxes.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="characterization">Characterization</h2>
<h3 id="creation-and-casting">Creation and casting</h3>
<p><img src="MaggieQSDCCJuly10.jpg" title="fig:Maggie Q plays the series&#39; eponymous character. It was the actress&#39; first role in television." alt="Maggie Q plays the series&#39; eponymous character. It was the actress&#39; first role in television." /> <a href="The_CW_Television_Network" title="wikilink">The CW</a> was looking to create a female-driven action series. Creator Craig Silverstein discussed with <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> about the previous incarnations of Nikita (<a href="Nikita_(film)" title="wikilink">the original 1990 film</a>, and <em><a href="La_Femme_Nikita" title="wikilink">La Femme Nikita</a></em>) and wished to make the current television series look fresh. Silverstein wanted to follow Nikita after she left the agency, as that chapter was yet to be told in the previous incarnations. He also believed it would have done the original story justice. Also, he wanted to include a highlight of Nikita's original story in the pilot to earn the title, and then move on from there. Silverstein described Nikita's transition in a Collider interview; &quot;It's a dark fairytale. This girl is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like <em><a href="Alice_in_Wonderland" title="wikilink">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>. She's told, &quot;Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that,&quot; and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>On February 2010 it was announced that Maggie Q was in talks to play the title character of <em>Nikita</em>. Q's casting would mark the highest-profile series role for an Asian actress on a broadcast drama series.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Q was drawn to the series because she was intrigued by the <a href="Nikita_(film)" title="wikilink">original film</a> and <a href="Luc_Besson" title="wikilink">Luc Besson</a>'s creation of an incredibly flawed female. According to the actress the process of her casting took about four to five days.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In describing Q's casting, Silverstein stated;</p>

<p>Appearing on Nikita would be Q's first television role. During an interview with <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, Q explained that she previously was not on television &quot;not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it,&quot; adding &quot;When this came up, everything just felt right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, there were times Nikita had to be dressed in a certain way to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, but at the same time wanted Nikita's dress sense to be &quot;toned down a bit&quot; because she is an assassin. In one scene in particular Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which &quot;mortified&quot; her. She added &quot;that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Q performs her own stunts in the series.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The actress liked to have her character &quot;be able to do her own thing,&quot; as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted &quot;but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes on the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the more prominent aspects of Nikita's character development since the beginning of the series is her relationship with Michael,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and has been dubbed by fans as &quot;Mikita&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional &quot;Will They/Won't They?&quot; game between the two characters.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Co-star Shane West stated &quot;It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together,&quot; but it is &quot;really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, so why not keep teasing?&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Craig Silverstein wanted something to happen to get in their way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding &quot;I don't think you can just have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p>Nikita and Maggie Q's portrayal of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Alessandra Stanley of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> felt that Q was suited for the role, stating &quot;she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness,&quot; adding &quot;Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by <a href="Jennifer_Garner" title="wikilink">Jennifer Garner</a> on <em><a href="Alias_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, or the C.I.A. rookie that <a href="Piper_Perabo" title="wikilink">Piper Perabo</a> plays on <em><a href="Covert_Affairs" title="wikilink">Covert Affairs</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Troy Patterson of <em><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a></em> felt that &quot;Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as <em><a href="Bionic_Woman_(2007_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Bionic Woman's</a></em> <a href="Jaime_Sommers_(Bionic_Woman)" title="wikilink">Jaime Sommers</a> or <em><a href="Dollhouse_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dollhouse's</a></em> what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Robert Bianco of <em><a href="USA_Today" title="wikilink">USA Today</a></em> believed Q's performance was &quot;a fairly sizable incentive&quot; to watch the show, adding she &quot;combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered at the hands of evil men, and she's not going to take it anymore.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Alan Sepinwall of <a href="HitFix" class="uri" title="wikilink">HitFix</a> believed that Q &quot;carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Maureen Ryan of <a href="AOL_TV" title="wikilink">AOL TV</a> said &quot;Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Some other critics however, did not react so warmly towards Nikita. Chris Conaton of <a href="PopMatters" class="uri" title="wikilink">PopMatters</a> felt that Q &quot;seems to be a good choice for the title role,&quot; but noted that the pilot did not call attention to the character's background. That said Conaton stated &quot;it's still something of a novelty to build a TV series around an Asian American lead&lt;U+2014&gt;though plenty of recent ensemble and reality TV shows have featured prominent cast members of Asian descent.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Matthew Gilbert of <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> flet that Q was &quot;too much of a sad sack,&quot; adding &quot;Q doesn't seem able to layer any other emotions over her cold resolve,&quot; and compares the character to &quot;a little bit like [<em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em> character] <a href="Debbie_Downer" title="wikilink">Debbie Downer</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Mary McNamara of The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> believed that while Nikita does &quot;provides some sizzle,&quot; her emotions &quot;run that famous distance from A to B, as do virtually [every other characters].&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the show started airing, Q posed for several billboard posters. However, they were met with some controversy for being revealing, and several locations across the United States, including in areas of <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, refused to allow them to be put up, as they were located near churches and schools. Rick Haskins, the marketing executive for the CW stated &quot;we've been down this road a few times with some of our campaigns.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
