<p><strong>Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus</strong> (official nomenclature <small>CN&lt;U+00B7&gt;POMPEIVS&lt;U+00B7&gt;CN&lt;U+00B7&gt;F&lt;U+00B7&gt;SEX&lt;U+00B7&gt;N&lt;U+00B7&gt;MAGNVS</small>;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> 29 September 106 BC &lt;U+2013&gt; 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as <strong>Pompey</strong>  or <strong>Pompey the Great</strong>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> was a military and political leader of the late <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a>. He came from a wealthy <a href="Picenum" title="wikilink">Italian provincial</a> background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the <a href="nobiles" title="wikilink">Roman nobility</a>. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consulship</a> without meeting the normal <a href="cursus_honorum" title="wikilink">requirements for office</a>. Military success in <a href="Sulla&#39;s_Second_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Sulla's Second Civil War</a> led him to adopt the <a href="cognomen" title="wikilink">nickname</a> <em><a href="List_of_Roman_cognomina#M" title="wikilink">Magnus</a></em>, &quot;the Great&quot;. He was <em>consul</em> three times, and celebrated three <a href="Roman_triumph" title="wikilink">triumphs</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-60 BC, Pompey joined <a href="Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="wikilink">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> and <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Gaius Julius Caesar</a> in the unofficial military-political alliance known as the <a href="First_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">First Triumvirate</a>, which Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter <a href="Julia_(daughter_of_Julius_Caesar)" title="wikilink">Julia</a> helped secure. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus, Pompey sided with the <em><a href="optimates" class="uri" title="wikilink">optimates</a></em>, the conservative faction of the <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Roman Senate</a>. Pompey and Caesar then contended for the leadership of the Roman state, leading to <a href="Caesar&#39;s_civil_war" title="wikilink">a civil war</a>. When Pompey was defeated at the <a href="Battle_of_Pharsalus" title="wikilink">Battle of Pharsalus</a>, he sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated. His career and defeat are significant in Rome's subsequent transformation from <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Republic</a> to <a href="Principate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Principate</a> and <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Empire</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-political-debut">Early life and political debut</h2>
<p>Pompey's father, <a href="Gnaeus_Pompeius_Strabo" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo</a>, was a wealthy landed Italian provincial from <a href="Picenum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picenum</a>, one of the <em>homines novi</em> (new men). Pompeius Strabo ascended the traditional <em><a href="cursus_honorum" title="wikilink">cursus honorum</a></em>, becoming <em><a href="quaestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">quaestor</a></em> in 104 BC, <em><a href="praetor" class="uri" title="wikilink">praetor</a></em> in 92 BC and <em><a href="Roman_Consul" title="wikilink">consul</a></em> in 89 BC, and acquired a reputation for greed, political double-dealing and military ruthlessness. He supported <a href="Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla" title="wikilink">Sulla</a>'s traditionalist <em><a href="optimates" class="uri" title="wikilink">optimates</a></em> against the <a href="Populares" title="wikilink">popularist</a> general <a href="Gaius_Marius" title="wikilink">Marius</a> in the <a href="Sulla&#39;s_first_civil_war" title="wikilink">first Marian-Sullan</a> war.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He died during the Marian siege against Rome in 87 BC, either as a casualty of pandemic plague, or struck by lightning, or possibly both.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In Plutarch's account, his body was dragged from its <a href="bier" class="uri" title="wikilink">bier</a> by the mob.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His twenty year-old son Pompey inherited his estates, his political leanings and the loyalty of his legions.</p>
<p><img src="PompeoMagno.jpg" title="fig:Roman statue of Pompey, at the Villa Arconati a Castellazzo di Bollate (Milan, Italy). It was brought there from Rome in 1627 by Galeazzo Arconati." alt="Roman statue of Pompey, at the Villa Arconati a Castellazzo di Bollate (Milan, Italy). It was brought there from Rome in 1627 by Galeazzo Arconati." width="200" /> Pompey had served two years under his father's command, and had participated in the final acts of the <a href="Social_War_(91&lt;U+2013&gt;88_BC)" title="wikilink">Marsic Social War</a> against the Italians. He returned to Rome and was prosecuted for misappropriation of plunder: his betrothal to the judge's daughter, <a href="Antistia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antistia</a>, secured a rapid acquittal.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>For the next few years, the <a href="Gaius_Marius" title="wikilink">Marians</a> had possession of Italy.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When Sulla returned from campaigning against <a href="Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Mithridates</a> in <a href="83&amp;nbsp;BC" class="uri" title="wikilink">83&amp;nbsp;BC</a>, Pompey raised three Picenean legions to support him against the Marian regime of <a href="Gnaeus_Papirius_Carbo" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Papirius Carbo</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Sulla and his allies displaced the Marians in Italy and Rome: Sulla, now <a href="Roman_dictator" title="wikilink">Dictator</a> of Rome, was impressed by the young Pompey's self-confident performance. He addressed him as <em><a href="imperator" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperator</a></em> and offered him his stepdaughter, <a href="Aemilia_Scaura" title="wikilink">Aemilia Scaura</a>, in marriage. Aemilia &lt;U+2013&gt; already married and pregnant &lt;U+2013&gt; divorced her husband and Pompey divorced Antistia.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Though Aemilia died in childbirth soon after, the marriage confirmed Pompey's loyalty and greatly boosted his career.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sicily-and-africa">Sicily and Africa</h2>
<p>With the war in Italy over, Sulla sent Pompey against the <a href="Gaius_Marius" title="wikilink">Marians</a> in Sicily and Africa.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 82 BC, Pompey secured Sicily, guaranteeing <a href="Rome&#39;s_grain_supply" title="wikilink">Rome's grain supply</a>. He executed Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and his supporters out of hand, which may have led to his dubbing as the <em>adulescens carnifex</em> (adolescent butcher).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 81 BC, he moved on to the Roman province of <a href="Africa_Province" title="wikilink">Africa</a>, where he defeated <a href="Gnaeus_Domitius_Ahenobarbus_(died_81&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus</a> and the <a href="Numidia" title="wikilink">Numidian</a> king Hiarbas, after a hard-fought battle.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>After this string of victories, Pompey was proclaimed <em><a href="Imperator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imperator</a></em> by his troops on the field in Africa; once back in Rome, he was given an enthusiastic popular reception and hailed by Sulla as <em>Magnus</em> (the Great) &lt;U+2013&gt; probably in recognition of Pompey's undoubted victories and popularity, but also with some degree of sarcasm. The young general was still officially a mere <em><a href="privatus" class="uri" title="wikilink">privatus</a></em> (private citizen) who had held no offices in the <em><a href="cursus_honorum" title="wikilink">cursus honorum</a></em>. The title may have been meant to cut Pompey down to size; he himself used it only later in his career.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>When Pompey demanded a <a href="Roman_triumph" title="wikilink">triumph</a> for his African victories, Sulla refused; it would be an unprecedented, even illegal, honour for a young privatus &lt;U+2013&gt; he must disband his legions. Pompey refused, and presented himself expectantly at the gates of Rome. Sulla gave in.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, Sulla had his own triumph first, then allowed <a href="Metellus_Pius" title="wikilink">Metellus Pius</a> his triumph, relegating Pompey to an extra-legal third place in a quick succession of triumphs.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On the day, Pompey attempted to upstage both his seniors in a triumphal chariot towed by an elephant, representing his exotic African conquests. The elephant would not fit through the city gate. Some hasty replanning was needed, much to the embarrassment of Pompey and amusement of those present.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> His refusal to give in to his troops' near-mutinous demands for cash probably impressed his mentor and Rome's conservatives.</p>

</figure>
<p>Pompey's career seems to have been driven by desire for military glory and disregard for traditional political constraints.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the consular elections of <a href="78&amp;nbsp;BC" class="uri" title="wikilink">78&amp;nbsp;BC</a>, he supported <a href="Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(consul_78&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">Lepidus</a> against Sulla's wishes. In 78, Sulla died; when Lepidus revolted, Pompey suppressed him on behalf of the Senate. Then he asked for <a href="proconsul" title="wikilink">proconsular</a> <em><a href="imperium" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperium</a></em> in <a href="Hispania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispania</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> to deal with the <em><a href="populares" class="uri" title="wikilink">populares</a></em> general <a href="Quintus_Sertorius" title="wikilink">Quintus Sertorius</a>, who had held out for the past three years against <a href="Quintus_Caecilius_Metellus_Pius" title="wikilink">Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius</a>, one of Sulla's most able generals.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Roman aristocracy turned him down &lt;U+2013&gt; they were beginning to fear the young, popular and successful general. Pompey resorted to his tried and tested persuasion; he refused to disband his legions until his request was granted.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The senate acceded, reluctantly granted him the title of proconsul and powers equal to those of Metellus, and sent him to Hispania.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Pompey remained there from 76 &lt;U+2013&gt; 71 BC; he was for long unable to bring <a href="Sertorian_War" title="wikilink">the war</a> to an end due to Sertorius' guerrilla tactics. Though he was never able to decisively beat Sertorius (and he nearly met disaster at the battle of Sucro), he won several campaigns against Sertorius' junior officers in a war of attrition. Sertorius was significantly weakened, and by 74 BC, Metellus and Pompey were winning city after city.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, Pompey managed to crush the <em>populares</em> when Sertorius was murdered by his own officer, <a href="Marcus_Perperna_Vento" title="wikilink">Marcus Perperna Vento</a>, who was defeated in 72 by the young general, at their first battle. By early 71, the whole of Hispania was subdued.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Pompey showed a talent for efficient organisation and fair administration in the conquered province; this extended his patronage throughout Hispania and into southern <a href="Gaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaul</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Some time in 71 BC, he set off for Italy, along with his army.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="wikilink">Crassus</a> was facing <a href="Spartacus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spartacus</a> to end Rome's <a href="Third_Servile_War" title="wikilink">Third Servile War</a>. Crassus defeated Spartacus, but in his march towards Rome, Pompey encountered the remnants of Spartacus' army; he captured five thousand of them and claimed the credit for finishing the revolt, which infuriated Crassus.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Back in Rome, Pompey was wildly popular. On December 31, 71 BC, he was given a triumph for his victories in Hispania &lt;U+2013&gt; like his first, it was granted extralegally. To his admirers, he was the most brilliant general of the age, evidently favoured by the gods and a possible champion of the people's rights. He had successfully faced down Sulla and his Senate; he or his influence might restore the traditional plebeian rights and privileges lost under Sulla's dictatorship.</p>
<p>So Pompey was allowed to bypass another ancient Roman tradition; at only 35 years of age and while not even a senator, he was elected <em><a href="Consul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Consul</a></em> by an overwhelming majority vote, and served in 70 BC with Crassus as partner. Pompey's meteoric rise to the consulship was unprecedented; his tactics offended the traditionalist nobility whose values he claimed to share and defend. He had left them no option but to allow his consulship.</p>
<h2 id="campaign-against-the-pirates">Campaign against the pirates</h2>

<p><img src="Denier_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_l&#39;effigie_de_Pomp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e.jpg" title="fig:Pompey" alt="Pompey" /> Two years after his consulship, Pompey was offered command of a naval task force to deal with piracy in the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Sea</a>. The conservative faction of the Senate remained suspicious and wary of him; this seemed yet another illegal or at least extraordinary appointment.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Pompey's supporters for this command &lt;U+2013&gt; including <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Caesar</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; were in the minority, but support was whipped up through his nomination by the <a href="Tribune" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tribune</a> of the Plebs <a href="Aulus_Gabinius" title="wikilink">Aulus Gabinius</a> who proposed a <em><a href="Lex_Gabinia" title="wikilink">Lex Gabinia</a></em>; Pompey should have control over the sea and the coasts for 50 miles inland. This would set him above every military leader in the East &lt;U+2013&gt; it was passed despite vehement opposition.</p>
<p>According to Rome's historians, <a href="piracy" title="wikilink">pirates</a> had freely plundered the coastal cities of Greece, Asia and Italy itself. The extent and nature of their threat is questionable; anything that threatened Rome's grain supply was cause for panic. Roman public opinion and Pompey's supporters may have exaggerated the solution. Various settlements, peoples and city-states around the Mediterranean had coexisted several centuries and most had operated small fleets for war, or trade in commodities, including slaves. Their alliances might be loose and temporary or more-or-less permanent; some regarded themselves as nations.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>With Rome's increasing hegemony, the independent maritime economies of the Mediterranean would have been further marginalised; an increasing number would have resorted to piracy. As long as they met Rome's increasing requirement for slaves, left her allies and territories untouched and offered her enemies no support, they were tolerated. Some were subsidised.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> But fear of piracy was potent &lt;U+2013&gt; and these same pirates, it was later alleged, had assisted Sertorius.</p>
<p>By the end of that winter, the preparations were complete. Pompey allocated one of thirteen areas to each of his <a href="legatus" title="wikilink">legates</a>, and sent out their fleets. In forty days, the western Mediterranean was cleared.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Dio reported communication was restored between Hispania, Africa, and Italy;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and that Pompey then attended to the largest of these alliances, centered on the coast of &quot;Rough <a href="Cilicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cilicia</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> After &quot;defeating&quot; its fleet, he induced its surrender with promises of pardon, and settled many of its people at <a href="Soli,_Cilicia" title="wikilink">Soli</a>, which was henceforward called Pompeiopolis.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>De Souza (2002) finds that Pompey had officially returned the Cilicians to their own cities, which were ideal bases for piracy and not &lt;U+2013&gt; as Dio would have it &lt;U+2013&gt; for the dignified reformation of pirates as farmers. Pompey's entire campaign is therefore in question; its description as &quot;war&quot; is hyperbole &lt;U+2013&gt; some form of treaty or payoff is likely, with Pompey as chief negotiator. This was standard practice, but undignified and seldom acknowledged; Rome's generals were supposed to wage and win wars. A decade on, in the 50s BC, the Cilicians and pirates in general remained a nuisance to Rome's sea trade.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In Rome, however, Pompey was hero; once again, he had guaranteed the grain supply. According to Plutarch, by the end of the summer of 66 BC, his forces had swept the Mediterranean clear of opposition. Pompey was hailed as the first man in Rome, <em><a href="Primus_inter_pares" title="wikilink">Primus inter pares</a></em> (the first among equals). Cicero could not resist a <a href="panegyric" class="uri" title="wikilink">panegyric</a>:<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pompey made his preparations for the war at the end of the winter, entered upon it at the commencement of spring, and finished it in the middle of the summer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expedience of his campaign probably guaranteed Pompey his next and even more impressive command, this time in Rome's long-running war against Mithridates. By the 40s BC, Cicero could comment less favourably on the pirate campaign, and especially the funded &quot;resettlement&quot; at Soli/Pompeiopolis; &quot;we give immunity to pirates and make our allies pay tribute.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

In his absence from Rome (66 BC), he was nominated to succeed Lucius Licinius <a href="Lucullus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucullus</a> as commander in the <a href="Third_Mithridatic_War" title="wikilink">Third Mithridatic War</a> against <a href="Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a> in the East. Pompey's command was proposed by the tribune <a href="Gaius_Manilius" title="wikilink">Gaius Manilius</a>, supported by Caesar and justified by <a href="Cicero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> in <em>pro Lege Manilia</em>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His brother-in-law <a href="Quintus_Metellus_Celer" title="wikilink">Quintus Metellus Celer</a> served underneath him at this time and followed him in his exploits in the East. Like the Gabinian law, it was opposed by the aristocracy, but was carried nonetheless.</p>
<p>Lucullus, a <a href="Plebs" title="wikilink">plebeian</a> noble, was incensed at the prospect of his replacement by a &quot;new man&quot; such as Pompey. The outgoing commander and his replacements traded insults. Lucullus called Pompey a &quot;vulture&quot; who fed from the work of others. Lucullus was referring not merely to Pompey's new command against Mithridates, but also his claim to have finished the war against Spartacus.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>At Pompey's approach, Mithridates strategically withdrew his forces. <a href="Tigranes_the_Great" title="wikilink">Tigranes the Great</a> refused him refuge, so he made his way to his own dominions in the <a href="Cimmerian_Bosporus" title="wikilink">Cimmerian Bosporus</a>. Pompey secured a treaty with Tigranes, and in 65 BC set out in pursuit of Mithridates, but <a href="Pompey&#39;s_Georgian_campaign" title="wikilink">met resistance</a> from the Caucasian <a href="Caucasian_Iberia" title="wikilink">Iberians</a> and <a href="Caucasian_Albania" title="wikilink">Albanians</a>. He advanced to <a href="Phasis_(town)" title="wikilink">Phasis</a> in Colchis and liaised with his legate Servilius, admiral of his Euxine fleet, before decisively defeating Mithridates.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Pompey then retraced his steps, wintered at <a href="Pontus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pontus</a>, and made it into a Roman province. In 64 BC, he marched into <a href="History_of_Syria" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, deposed its king, <a href="Antiochus_XIII_Asiaticus" title="wikilink">Antiochus XIII Asiaticus</a>, and reconstituted this, too, as a Roman province.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 63 BC, he moved south, and established Roman supremacy in <a href="Phoenicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenicia</a> and <a href="Coele-Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coele-Syria</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Judea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judea</a>, Pompey intervened in the civil war between <a href="Hyrcanus&amp;nbsp;II" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyrcanus&amp;nbsp;II</a>, who supported the <a href="Pharisee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pharisee</a> faction and <a href="Aristobulus&amp;nbsp;II" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristobulus&amp;nbsp;II</a>, who supported the <a href="Sadducee" title="wikilink">Sadducees</a>.

<p>&quot;Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand, but of the Romans very few.... and no small enormities were committed about the <a href="Holy_of_Holies" title="wikilink">temple</a> itself, which, in former ages, had been inaccessible, and seen by none; for Pompey went into it, and not a few of those that were with him also, and saw all that which it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests. There were in that temple the golden table, the holy candlestick, and the pouring vessels, and a great quantity of spices; and besides these there were among the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money: yet did Pompey touch nothing of all this, on account of his regard to religion; and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue. The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it, and to bring what offerings the law required to God; and restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, both because he had been useful to him in other respects, and because he hindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him.&quot; (<a href="Josephus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Josephus</a>, <em><a href="Antiquities_of_the_Jews" title="wikilink">Antiquities of the Jews</a></em>, book 14, chapter 4; tr. by William Whiston, available at Project Gutenberg.)</p>

<p>During the war in Judea, Pompey heard of Mithridates' suicide; his army had deserted him for his son <a href="Pharnaces_II_of_Pontus" title="wikilink">Pharnaces</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In all, Pompey had annexed four new provinces to the Republic: <a href="Bithynia_et_Pontus" title="wikilink">Bithynia et Pontus</a>, <a href="Roman_Syria" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, <a href="Cilicia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Cilicia</a>, and <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>.

<p>News of Pompey's victories in the east &lt;U+2013&gt; and probably of his divine honours there &lt;U+2013&gt; reached Rome before he did. He had cult at Delos and was &quot;saviour&quot; in Samos and Mytelene. Plutarch quotes a wall-graffito in Athens, referring it to Pompey: &quot;The more you know you're a man, the more you become a god&quot;. In Greece, these honours were standard fare for benefactors. In Rome, they would have seemed dangerously monarchic.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In Pompey's absence, his old supporter Cicero had risen to the consulship. His old enemy and colleague <a href="Crassus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crassus</a> supported Caesar. In the Senate and behind its scenes, Pompey was probably equally admired, feared and excluded; on the streets he was as popular as ever. His eastern victories earned him his third triumph. On his 45th birthday, in 61 BC, he rode the triumphal chariot, a magnificent god-king, but one of Republican form, ritualistically reminded of his impermanence and mortality. Even so, he was accompanied by a gigantic portrait head of himself, studded with pearls.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>His third triumph exceeded all others; an unprecedented two days were scheduled for its procession and games (<em><a href="ludi" class="uri" title="wikilink">ludi</a></em>). Spoils, prisoners, army and banners depicting battle scenes wended the triumphal route between the <a href="Campus_Martius" title="wikilink">Campus Martius</a> and the Capitoline temple of <a href="Jupiter_(god)" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>. To conclude, he gave an immense triumphal banquet and money to the people of Rome, and promised them a new theatre.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Plutarch claimed this triumph represented Pompey's &lt;U+2013&gt; and therefore Rome's &lt;U+2013&gt; domination over the entire world, an achievement to outshine even Alexander's.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In the meantime, Pompey promised his retiring veterans public lands to farm, then dismissed his armies. It was a reassuringly traditional gesture, but the Senate remained suspicious. They debated and delayed his eastern political settlements<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and the promised gifts of public land. From now on, Pompey seems to have toed a cautious line between his enthusiastic popular supporters and the conservatives who seemed so reluctant to acknowledge his solid achievements. It would lead him into unexpected political alliances.</p>
<h2 id="caesar-and-the-first-triumvirate">Caesar and the First Triumvirate</h2>
<p>Although Pompey and Crassus distrusted each other, Crassus' <a href="tax_farming" title="wikilink">tax farming</a> clients were being rebuffed at the same time Pompey's veterans were being ignored, and by 61 BC, their grievances had pushed them both into an alliance with Caesar, six years younger than Pompey, returning from service in Hispania and ready to seek the <a href="consul" title="wikilink">consulship</a> for 59 BC. Their political alliance, known subsequently as the <a href="First_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">First Triumvirate</a>, operated to the benefit of each. Pompey and Crassus would make Caesar Consul, and Caesar would use his consular power to promote their claims.</p>
<p>Caesar's consulship of 59 BC brought Pompey land for his veterans, confirmation of his Asian political settlements and a new wife. She was Caesar's daughter, <a href="Julia_(daughter_of_Julius_Caesar)" title="wikilink">Julia</a>; Pompey was said to be besotted by her.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In the same year, <a href="Publius_Clodius_Pulcher" title="wikilink">Clodius</a> renounced his patrician status, was adopted into a <a href="plebeian" class="uri" title="wikilink">plebeian</a> <em>gens</em> and was elected a <a href="Tribune_of_the_plebs" title="wikilink">Tribune of the plebs</a>. At the end of his consulship, Caesar secured proconsular command in Gaul. Pompey was given the <a href="Roman_Governor" title="wikilink">governorship</a> of Hispania Ulterior, but remained in Rome to oversee <a href="Rome&#39;s_grain_supply" title="wikilink">the grain supply</a> as <em>curator annonae</em>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite his preoccupation with his new wife, Pompey handled the grain issue well. His political acumen was less sure. When Clodius turned on him in turn, Pompey defended himself by supporting Cicero's recall from exile (57 BC). Once back in Rome, Cicero stepped back into his role as Pompey's defender and Clodius' antagonist, but Pompey himself retreated to his lovely young wife and his theatre plans; such behaviour was not expected of the once dazzling young general.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Pompey might equally have been obsessed, exhausted and frustrated. His own party had not forgiven him for allowing Cicero's expulsion. Some tried to persuade him that Crassus was plotting his assassination. Meanwhile, Caesar seemed set on outstripping both his colleagues in generalship and popularity.</p>
<p>By 56 BC, the bonds between the three men were fraying.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Caesar called first Crassus, then Pompey, to a secret meeting, the <a href="Lucca_Conference" title="wikilink">Lucca Conference</a>, in the northern Italian town of <a href="Lucca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucca</a> to rethink their joint strategy. They agreed that Pompey and Crassus would again stand for the consulship in 55 BC. Once elected, they would extend Caesar's command in Gaul by five years. At the end of their joint consular year, Crassus would have the influential and lucrative governorship of Syria, and use this as a base to conquer Parthia. Pompey would keep Hispania <em>in absentia</em>.</p>
<p>In 55 BC, Pompey and Crassus were elected as consuls, against a background of bribery, civil unrest and electioneering violence.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="Theatre_of_Pompey" title="wikilink">Pompey's new theatre</a> was inaugurated in the same year. It was Rome's first permanent theatre, a gigantic, architecturally daring, self-contained complex on the <a href="Campus_Martius" title="wikilink">Campus Martius</a>, complete with shops, multi-service buildings, gardens and a temple to <a href="Venus_Victrix" title="wikilink">Venus Victrix</a>. The latter connected its donor to Aeneas, a son of Venus and ancestor of Rome itself. In its portico, the statuary, paintings and personal wealth of foreign kings could be admired at leisure. Pompey's triumph lived on.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> His theatre made an ideal meeting place for his supporters.</p>
<h2 id="from-confrontation-to-war">From confrontation to war</h2>
<p>In 54 BC, Julia, Caesar's only child and Pompey's wife, died in childbirth along with her baby. Pompey and Caesar shared their grief and condolences, but Julia's death broke their family bonds.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The following year, <a href="Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="wikilink">Crassus</a>, his son <a href="Publius_Licinius_Crassus_(son_of_triumvir)" title="wikilink">Publius</a> and most of his army were annihilated by the Parthians at <a href="Battle_of_Carrhae" title="wikilink">Carrhae</a>. Caesar, not Pompey, was now Rome's great new general and the fragile balance of power between them was under threat. Public anxiety spilled over: rumours circulated that Pompey would be offered dictatorship for the sake of law and order.</p>
<p>Caesar sought a second matrimonial alliance with Pompey, offering his grandniece <a href="Octavia_Minor" title="wikilink">Octavia</a> (the sister of the future emperor <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a>). This time, though, Pompey refused. In 52 BC, he married <a href="Cornelia_Metella" title="wikilink">Cornelia Metella</a>, the very young widow of Crassus's son Publius, and the daughter of <a href="Quintus_Caecilius_Metellus_Pius_Scipio_Nasica" title="wikilink">Caecilius Metellus Scipio</a>, one of Caesar&lt;U+2019&gt;s greatest enemies. Pompey was drifting back toward the <em>optimates</em>. It can be presumed that they thought him the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>In the same year, <a href="Publius_Clodius" title="wikilink">Publius Clodius</a> was murdered. When his supporters burned down the <a href="Curia_Hostilia" title="wikilink">Senate House</a> in retaliation, the Senate appealed to Pompey. He reacted with ruthless efficiency. Cicero, defending the accused murderer <a href="Titus_Annius_Milo" title="wikilink">Titus Annius Milo</a>, was so shaken by a <a href="Roman_Forum" title="wikilink">Forum</a> seething with armed soldiers, he was unable to complete his defense.</p>
<p>Once order was restored, the Senate and <a href="Cato_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Cato</a> avoided granting Pompey dictatorship &lt;U+2013&gt; it recalled Sulla and his bloody proscriptions. Instead they made him sole Consul; this gave him sweeping, but limited, powers. A Dictator could not be lawfully punished for measures taken during his office. As sole Consul, Pompey would be answerable for his actions once out of office.</p>
<p>While Caesar was fighting against <a href="Vercingetorix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vercingetorix</a> in <a href="Gaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaul</a>, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome. Its details suggested covert alliance with Caesar's enemies: among his various legal and military reforms was a law allowing retrospective prosecution for electoral bribery. Caesar's allies correctly interpreted this as a threat to Caesar once his <em>imperium</em> ended. Pompey also prohibited Caesar from standing for the consulship <em>in absentia</em>, though this had been permitted under past laws.</p>
<p>This seemed to put paid to Caesar's plans after his term in Gaul expired. Finally, in 51 BC, Pompey was more forthright; Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he relinquished his armies. This would, of course, leave Caesar defenseless before his enemies. As Cicero sadly noted, Pompey had been diminished by age, uncertainty, his fear of Caesar and the strain of being the chosen tool of a quarreling oligarchy of <em>optimates</em>. The coming conflict seemed inevitable.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="civil-war-and-assassination">Civil war and assassination</h2>

<p><img src="La_Fuite_de_Pomp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e.jpg" title="fig:The Flight of Pompey after Pharsalus, by Jean Fouquet" alt="The Flight of Pompey after Pharsalus, by Jean Fouquet" /> In the beginning, Pompey claimed he could defeat Caesar and raise armies merely by stamping his foot on the soil of Italy, but by the spring of 49 BC, with Caesar <a href="crossing_the_Rubicon" title="wikilink">crossing the Rubicon</a> and his invading legions sweeping down the peninsula, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. His legions retreated south towards <a href="Brundisium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brundisium</a>, where Pompey intended to find renewed strength by waging war against Caesar in the east. In the process, neither Pompey nor the Senate thought of taking the vast treasury with them, probably thinking Caesar would not dare take it for himself. It was left conveniently in the <a href="Temple_of_Saturn" title="wikilink">Temple of Saturn</a> when Caesar and his forces entered Rome.</p>
<p>Barely eluding Caesar in Brundisium, Pompey crossed over into <a href="Epirus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epirus</a>, where, during Caesar's Spanish campaign, Pompey had gathered a large force in Macedonia, comprising nine legions reinforced by contingents from the Roman allies in the east.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> His fleet, recruited from the maritime cities in the east, controlled the <a href="Adriatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adriatic</a>. Nevertheless, Caesar managed to cross over into Epirus in November 49 BC, and proceeded to capture <a href="Apollonia,_Illyria" title="wikilink">Apollonia</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Pompey managed to arrive in time to save <a href="Dyrrhachium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dyrrhachium</a>, and he then attempted to wait Caesar out during the <a href="Battle_of_Dyrrhachium_(48&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">siege of Dyrrhachium</a>, in which Caesar lost 1000 men and Pompey lost 2000. Yet, by failing to pursue at the critical moment of Caesar's defeat, Pompey threw away the chance to destroy Caesar's much smaller army. As Caesar himself said, &quot;Today the enemy would have won, if they had a commander who was a winner&quot; (Plutarch, 65).</p>
<p>According to <a href="Suetonius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suetonius</a>, it was at this point that Caesar said that &quot;that man (Pompey) does not know how to win a war.&quot; With Caesar on their backs, the conservatives led by Pompey fled to Greece. Caesar and Pompey had their final showdown at the <a href="Battle_of_Pharsalus" title="wikilink">Battle of Pharsalus</a> in 48 BC. The fighting was bitter for both sides, and although Pompey was expected to win, due to advantage in numbers, the brilliant tactics and the superior fighting abilities of Caesar's veterans led to a victory for Caesar. Pompey met his wife Cornelia and his son <a href="Sextus_Pompeius" title="wikilink">Sextus Pompeius</a> on the island of <a href="Mytilene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mytilene</a>. He then wondered where to go next. The decision of running to one of the eastern kingdoms was overruled in favour of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>.</p>
<p>After his arrival in Egypt, Pompey's fate was decided by the counselors of the young king <a href="Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;XIII" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;XIII</a>. While Pompey waited offshore, they argued the cost of offering him refuge with Caesar already en route to Egypt; the king's eunuch <a href="Pothinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pothinus</a> won out. In the final dramatic passages of his biography, Plutarch had Cornelia watch anxiously from the trireme as Pompey left in a small boat with a few sullen, silent comrades, and headed for what appeared to be a welcoming party on the Egyptian shore at <a href="Pelusium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pelusium</a>. As Pompey rose to disembark, he was stabbed to death by his betrayers, <a href="Achillas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Achillas</a>, <a href="Lucius_Septimius" title="wikilink">Septimius</a> and Salvius.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Plutarch has him meet his fate with great dignity, one day after his 59th birthday. His body remained on the shoreline, to be cremated by his loyal freeman Philip on the rotten planks of a fishing boat. His head and seal were presented to Caesar, who, according to Plutarch, mourned this insult to the greatness of his former ally and son-in-law, and punished his assassins and their Egyptian co-conspirators, putting both Achillas and Pothinus to death. Pompey's ashes were eventually returned to Cornelia, who carried them to his country house near <a href="Alba_Longa" title="wikilink">Alba</a>.<ref name="Plutarch, Pompey, 79<U+2013>80&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a href="Cassius_Dio" title="wikilink">Cassius Dio</a> describes Caesar's reactions with scepticism, and considers Pompey's own political misjudgements, rather than treachery, as instrumental in his downfall.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In Appian's account of the civil war, Caesar has Pompey's severed head interred in Alexandria, in ground reserved for a new temple to the goddess <a href="Nemesis_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Nemesis</a>, whose divine functions included the punishment of <a href="hubris" class="uri" title="wikilink">hubris</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> For <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny</a>, the humiliation of Pompey's end is anticipated by the vaunting pride of his oversized portrait-head, studded entirely with pearls, and carried in procession during his greatest Triumph.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="later-portrayals-and-reputation">Later portrayals and reputation</h2>
<p>For the historians of his own and later Roman periods, Pompey fit the trope of the great man who achieved extraordinary triumphs through his own efforts, yet fell from power and was, in the end, murdered through treachery.</p>
<p>He was a hero of the Republic, who seemed once to hold the Roman world in his palm, only to be brought low by his own poor judgment and Caesar. Pompey was idealized as a tragic hero almost immediately after Pharsalus and his murder. Plutarch portrayed him as a Roman <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, pure of heart and mind, destroyed by the cynical ambitions of those around him. This portrayal of him survived into the <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> periods, for example in <a href="Pierre_Corneille" title="wikilink">Corneille</a>'s play <em><a href="The_Death_of_Pompey" title="wikilink">The Death of Pompey</a></em> (1642).</p>

<li id="fn16">Pompey's age, his equestrian status and his victory over Roman foes should have disqualified him from a triumph. Sulla's consent (formalised by his obedient senate as a Republican permission) made it a &quot;nontraditional&quot; and strictly illegal triumph, but a triumph nevertheless.

<li id="fn31">This probably refers to the grain supply; the extent of its interruption before Pompey's campaign is not known. The reference to Hispania might relate to Sertorius' revolt and resistance &lt;U+2013&gt; abetted, in some accounts, by &quot;Cilician pirates&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; or its aftermath.<a href="#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn32">Approximate to Southern Turkey. Once a Selucid province, in Pompey's day and for some time to come it was a semi-independent territory whose sovereignty was debated by neighbouring Greek polities.
