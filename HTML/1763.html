<p><strong>John Wilkes Booth</strong> (<a href="May_10" title="wikilink">May 10</a> <a href="1838" class="uri" title="wikilink">1838</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="April_26" title="wikilink">April 26</a> <a href="1865" class="uri" title="wikilink">1865</a>) was an American <a href="stage_actor" title="wikilink">stage actor</a> who assassinated <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a> at <a href="Ford&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">Ford's Theatre</a>, in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, on <a href="April_14" title="wikilink">April 14</a>, <a href="1865" class="uri" title="wikilink">1865</a>. Lincoln died the next morning from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, becoming the first American president to be assassinated.</p>
<p>Booth was a member of the prominent 19th century <a href="Booth_family" title="wikilink">Booth theatrical family</a> from <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> and by the 1860s was a popular actor, well known in both the <a href="Northern_United_States" title="wikilink">Northern United States</a> and the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">South</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was also a <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> sympathizer who was vehement in his denunciation of the Lincoln Administration and outraged by the South's defeat in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>. He strongly opposed the abolition of <a href="slavery_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">slavery in the United States</a> and Lincoln's proposal to extend <a href="Suffrage" title="wikilink">voting rights</a> to recently emancipated slaves.</p>
<p>Booth, and a group of co-conspirators whom he led, planned to kill Abraham Lincoln, <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a>, and <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William_Henry_Seward,_Sr." title="wikilink">William Seward</a> in a desperate bid to help the tottering Confederacy's cause. Although <a href="Robert_E._Lee" title="wikilink">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="wikilink">Army of Northern Virginia</a> had surrendered four days earlier, Booth believed the war was not yet over since Confederate General <a href="Joseph_E._Johnston" title="wikilink">Joseph Johnston</a>'s army was still fighting the <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a> under General <a href="William_Tecumseh_Sherman" title="wikilink">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>. Of the conspirators, only Booth was successful in carrying out his part of the plot.</p>
<p>Following the shooting, Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland and eventually to a farm in rural northern <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, where he was tracked down and killed by Union soldiers twelve days later. Eight others were tried and convicted and four were <a href="hanging" title="wikilink">hanged</a> shortly thereafter. Over the years, various authors have suggested that Booth might have escaped his pursuers and subsequently died many years later under a pseudonym.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-early-life">Background and early life</h2>
<p>Booth's parents, the noted British <a href="Shakespeare_in_performance" title="wikilink">Shakespearean</a> actor <a href="Junius_Brutus_Booth" title="wikilink">Junius Brutus Booth</a> and his wife Mary Ann Holmes, immigrated to the United States from England in 1821. They purchased a farm near <a href="Bel_Air,_Harford_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Bel Air</a> in <a href="Harford_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Harford County, Maryland</a>, where John Wilkes Booth was born on May 10, 1838. He was named after the English <a href="Radicalism_(historical)" title="wikilink">radical</a> politician <a href="John_Wilkes" title="wikilink">John Wilkes</a>, claimed by the family as a distant relative.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Booth's later boyhood home, &quot;Tudor Hall&quot;, was built on the family's Harford County property in 1847 and still stands.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The Booth family also maintained a city residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore in the 1840s–1850s.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <img src="Tudor_Hall.jpg" title="fig:&quot;Tudor Hall&quot; in 1865" alt="&quot;Tudor Hall&quot; in 1865" /></p>
<p>As a boy, John Wilkes Booth attended the Bel Air Academy, where the headmaster described him as &quot;Not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1850&lt;U+2013&gt;1851, he attended the <a href="Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="wikilink">Quaker</a>-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in <a href="Sparks,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Sparks, Maryland</a> and later St. Timothy's Hall, an <a href="Episcopal_Church_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Episcopal</a> school in <a href="Catonsville,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Catonsville, Maryland</a>, beginning when he was 13 years old.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>While attending the Milton Boarding School, the youth met a <a href="Gypsy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gypsy</a> <a href="fortune-teller" class="uri" title="wikilink">fortune-teller</a> who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling Booth that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young, and &quot;meeting a bad end&quot;, she said.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to his sister, Booth wrote down the palm-reader's prediction and showed it to his family, often discussing its portents in moments of melancholy in later years. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As recounted by Booth's sister, <a href="Asia_Booth" title="wikilink">Asia Booth Clarke</a>, in her memoirs written in 1874, no one church was preeminent in the Booth household. Booth's mother was Episcopalian and his father was described as a free spirit, preferring a Sunday walk along the Baltimore waterfront with his children to attending church. On <a href="January_23" title="wikilink">January 23</a>, <a href="1853" class="uri" title="wikilink">1853</a>, the 14-year old Booth was finally <a href="Baptism" title="wikilink">baptized</a> at St. Timothy's Episcopal Church.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>By the age of 16, Booth was interested in the theatre and in politics, becoming a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the <a href="Know_Nothing" title="wikilink">Know Nothing Party</a> for <a href="Henry_Winter_Davis" title="wikilink">Henry Winter Davis</a>, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Booth also began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying the works of <a href="Shakespeare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a>. At age 17, he had his first stage role as the Earl of Richmond in <em><a href="Richard_III_(play)" title="wikilink">Richard III</a></em> at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre on August 14, 1855.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

Ford</a>, where the Booths had performed frequently.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He also began appearing at <a href="Ford&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">Ford's Theatre</a> in Washington, also owned by John T. Ford. In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. At his request he was billed as &quot;J.B. Wilkes&quot;, a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous thespian family. In 1858, he was accepted as a member of the Richmond Theatre, Virginia, stock company, and became increasingly popular with audiences. Called &quot;the handsomest man in America&quot; by some reviewers, other critics were mixed in their estimation of his acting.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He stood  tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was also an excellent swordsman and his performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> A fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> As the 1850s drew to a close, Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor, earning $20,000 a year (equivalent to more than $500,000 in 2009)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and appearing in such cities as New York, Boston, and New Orleans. On November 25, 1864, Booth acted in a version of Shakespeare's <em><a href="Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a></em>, where he played <a href="Mark_Antony" title="wikilink">Mark Antony</a>. His brother Edwin played the larger role of Brutus.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="civil-war-years">Civil War years</h2>
<p>Strongly opposed to the <a href="abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolitionists</a> who sought to end slavery in the U.S., Booth attended the hanging on <a href="December_2" title="wikilink">December 2</a>, <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a>, of abolitionist leader <a href="John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="wikilink">John Brown</a>, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal <a href="Armory_(military)" title="wikilink">armory</a> at <a href="Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Harpers Ferry</a> (in present-day <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a>).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Booth joined a volunteer militia of 1,500 men present in case abolitionists attempted to rescue Brown from the gallows by force.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He bought a uniform from a member of the Richmond Grays militia unit, which was heading for <a href="Charles_Town,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Charles Town</a>, and he joined the Grays, who stood guard for Brown's trial and execution. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood at the foot of the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a> was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth wrote a long speech that decried Northern <a href="abolitionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">abolitionism</a> and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of <a href="slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavery</a>. On <a href="April_12" title="wikilink">April 12</a>, <a href="1861" class="uri" title="wikilink">1861</a>, the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> began, and eventually eleven Southern states <a href="secession" title="wikilink">seceded</a> from the Union. Booth's family was from <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>, a <a href="Border_states_(Civil_War)" title="wikilink">border state</a> which remained in the <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a> during the war despite a slaveholding portion of the population that favored the <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederacy</a>. Because the secession of Maryland would leave <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> an indefensible <a href="enclave" class="uri" title="wikilink">enclave</a> within the Confederacy, Lincoln declared <a href="martial_law" title="wikilink">martial law</a> in Maryland and ordered the imprisonment of pro-secession Maryland political leaders at <a href="Ft._McHenry" title="wikilink">Ft. McHenry</a> to prevent the state's secession, a move that many, including Booth, viewed as <a href="unconstitutional" class="uri" title="wikilink">unconstitutional</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Booth was pro-Confederate, his family, like many Marylanders, was divided, and to preserve harmony among his brothers Booth promised his mother that he would not enlist in the <a href="Confederate_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate Army</a>. As a popular actor in the 1860s, he travelled extensively to perform in both North and South, and as far west as <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He further enriched himself by investments in land and oil wells. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle <a href="quinine" class="uri" title="wikilink">quinine</a> to the South during his travels there, helping the Confederacy obtain the needed drug despite the Northern blockade.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Booth was outspoken in his love for the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred for Lincoln. As the Civil War went on, Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin, who declined to make any stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to John Wilkes' fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and President Lincoln.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In early 1862, Booth was arrested by a provost marshal in <a href="Saint_Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a> for making anti-government remarks.</p>
<p><img src="Lucy_Hale.jpg" title="fig:Lucy Hale, Booth&#39;s fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e in 1865" alt="Lucy Hale, Booth&#39;s fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e in 1865" /> Booth and Lincoln crossed paths on several occasions. Lincoln was an avid theater-goer and especially loved Shakespeare. On November 9, 1863, Lincoln saw Booth in Charles Selby's <em>The Marble Heart</em> at Ford's Theatre in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington</a>. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln sat in the same presidential box in which he would later be assassinated.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Booth made the final appearance of his career at Ford's on March 18, 1865, when he played Duke Pescara in <em>The Apostate</em>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The previous month, Booth became infatuated with Lucy Hale, the daughter of U.S. Senator <a href="John_P._Hale" title="wikilink">John P. Hale</a> of New Hampshire, and they became secretly engaged when Booth received his mother's blessing for their marriage plans. &quot;You have so often been dead in love,&quot; his mother counseled Booth in a letter, &quot;be well assured she is really and truly devoted to you&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Booth composed a handwritten <a href="Valentine&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">Valentine card</a> for his betrothed on February 13, 1864, expressing his &quot;adoration&quot;. She was unaware of Booth's deep antipathy towards President Lincoln.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plotting-to-kidnap-lincoln">Plotting to kidnap Lincoln</h2>
<p>By 1864 the tide of the war had shifted in the North's favor. Booth, who had promised his mother at the outbreak of war that he would not enlist as a soldier, increasingly chafed at not actually fighting for the South, confiding in his diary, &quot;I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He began devising a plan to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the <a href="President_Lincoln_and_Soldiers&#39;_Home_National_Monument" title="wikilink">Old Soldiers Home</a>, three miles (5 km) from the White House, and to smuggle him across the <a href="Potomac_River" title="wikilink">Potomac River</a> into <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond</a>. Once in Confederate hands, Lincoln would be exchanged for the release of Confederate Army prisoners of war held captive in Northern prisons and to force an end to the war.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Throughout the Civil War, the Confederacy maintained a network of underground operators in southern Maryland, particularly <a href="Charles_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Charles</a> and <a href="St._Mary&#39;s_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">St. Mary's</a> counties, smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents as far north as Canada.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Booth recruited his friends <a href="Samuel_Arnold_(Lincoln_conspirator)" title="wikilink">Samuel Arnold</a> and <a href="Michael_O&#39;Laughlen" title="wikilink">Michael O'Laughlen</a> as accomplices.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> They met often at the house of Maggie Branson, a known Confederate sympathizer, at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <img src="Soldiers-Home-Lincoln-Cottage.jpg" title="fig:Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home" alt="Booth&#39;s plan was to kidnap Lincoln from the Old Soldiers Home" /> In the summer of 1864, Booth met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at <a href="The_Parker_House" title="wikilink">The Parker House</a> in <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. In October he made an unexplained trip to <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>, which at the time was a well-known center of clandestine Confederate activity. He spent ten days in the city, staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a rendezvous for the <a href="Confederate_Secret_Service" title="wikilink">Confederate Secret Service</a>, and meeting at least one blockade runner there. It is possible that it was here that he also met Confederate Secret Service director <a href="James_D._Bulloch" title="wikilink">James D. Bulloch</a>, as well as <a href="George_Nicholas_Sanders" title="wikilink">George Nicholas Sanders</a>, a one-time U.S. ambassador to Britain. Booth is believed to have been active in the &quot;<a href="Knights_of_the_Golden_Circle" title="wikilink">Knights of the Golden Circle</a>&quot;, described as a &quot;nest of 'Secesh' spies&quot; (that is, pro-<a href="secessionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">secessionist</a>).<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>No conclusive proof has linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving the leadership of the Confederate government, although historians such as <a href="David_Herbert_Donald" title="wikilink">David Herbert Donald</a> have said, &quot;...it is clear that, at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service, the abduction of the Union President was under consideration&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Other writers exploring possible connections between Booth's planning and Confederate agents include Nathan Miller's <em>Spying For America</em> and William Tidwell's <em>Come Retribution: the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln</em>.</p>
<p>After Lincoln's re-election in early November 1864, Booth devoted increasing energy and money to his kidnap plot. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including <a href="David_Herold" title="wikilink">David Herold</a>, <a href="George_Atzerodt" title="wikilink">George Atzerodt</a>, <a href="Lewis_Powell_(assassin)" title="wikilink">Lewis Powell</a> (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and <a href="John_Surratt" title="wikilink">John Surratt</a>, a rebel agent.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> They began to meet routinely at the boarding-house of Surratt's mother, Mrs. <a href="Mary_Surratt" title="wikilink">Mary Surratt</a>.</p>
<p>On November 25, 1864, Booth performed for the only time with his two brothers, <a href="Edwin_Booth" title="wikilink">Edwin</a> and <a href="Junius_Brutus_Booth,_Jr." title="wikilink">Junius</a>, in a single engagement production of <em><a href="Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a></em> at the <a href="Winter_Garden_Theatre_(1850)" title="wikilink">Winter Garden Theatre</a> in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The proceeds went towards a statue of Shakespeare for <a href="Central_Park" title="wikilink">Central Park</a> which still stands today. The following morning, Booth argued bitterly with his brother, Edwin, about Lincoln and the war.</p>
<p>Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia, saying, &quot;That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> As the Confederacy's defeat became more certain in 1865, Booth decried the end of slavery and Lincoln's election to a second term, &quot;making himself a king&quot;, the disgruntled actor fumed, in &quot;wild tirades&quot;, his sister recalled.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4 as the invited guest of his secret fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, Lucy Hale. In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There was no attempt to assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, however, Booth remarked about his &quot;excellent chance...to kill the President, if I had wished&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>On March 17, Booth learned at the last minute that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play <em>Still Waters Run Deep</em> at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where, coincidentally, Booth was staying at the time.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

Weichmann did not understand the reference. <em>Venice Preserv'd</em> is about an assassination plot. With the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, Booth's plan to kidnap Lincoln and smuggle the President south was no longer possible, so Booth had changed his abduction scheme into one of assassination.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The previous day, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. When Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting <a href="suffrage" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffrage</a> to the former slaves, Booth declared that it would be the last speech Lincoln would ever make.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> &quot;Our cause being almost lost&quot;, Booth wrote in his journal, &quot;something decisive and great <em>must</em> be done.&quot; <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>On the morning of <a href="Good_Friday" title="wikilink">Good Friday</a>, April 14, 1865, Booth learned that the President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play <em><a href="Our_American_Cousin" title="wikilink">Our American Cousin</a></em> at Ford's Theatre. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included making arrangements with livery stable owner <a href="James_W._Pumphrey" title="wikilink">James W. Pumphrey</a> for a getaway horse, and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William_H._Seward" title="wikilink">William H. Seward</a> and Atzerodt to assassinate <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a>. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <img src="John_Wilkes_Booth_wanted_poster_new.jpg" title="fig:Wanted poster for Booth, Surratt, and Herold" alt="Wanted poster for Booth, Surratt, and Herold" /></p>
<p>By targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the office, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. Booth also planned to assassinate the Union commanding general, <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a>; however, Grant's wife had promised to visit family and so they were departing Washington by train that evening for <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war.</p>
<p>As a famous and popular actor who had frequently performed at Ford's Theatre, and was well known to its owner John T. Ford, Booth had free access to all parts of the theater, even having his mail sent there.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> By boring a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day, the assassin could check that his intended victim had made it to the play. That evening, at around 10 p.m., as the play progressed, John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln's box and shot him in the back of the head with a .44 caliber <a href="Derringer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derringer</a>. Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major <a href="Henry_Rathbone" title="wikilink">Henry Rathbone</a>, who was present in the Presidential box with Mrs. <a href="Mary_Todd_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Mary Todd Lincoln</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Rathbone was stabbed by Booth when the startled officer lunged at the assassin.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="Clara_Harris" title="wikilink">Clara Harris</a>, Rathbone's fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e and also present in the box, was unhurt.</p>
<p>Booth then jumped from the President's box and fell to the stage, injuring his leg when it snagged on a <a href="U.S._Treasury" title="wikilink">U.S. Treasury</a> Guard flag used for decoration.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Witnesses said he shouted &quot;<em><a href="Sic_semper_tyrannis" title="wikilink">Sic semper tyrannis</a></em>&quot; (<a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> for &quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;, attributed to <a href="Marcus_Junius_Brutus#Influence" title="wikilink">Brutus at Caesar's assassination</a> and the Virginia state motto) from the stage, while others said he added, &quot;The South is avenged.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pursuit-and-death">Pursuit and death</h2>
<p><img src="Booth_escape_route.svg" title="fig:Booth&#39;s escape route" alt="Booth&#39;s escape route" width="300" /> In the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford's Theatre, Booth fled by a stage door to the alley, where his getaway horse was held for him by Joseph Burroughs. The owner of the horse had warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and would break halter if left unattended. Booth left the horse with <a href="Edmund_Spangler" title="wikilink">Edmund Spangler</a> and Spangler arranged for Burroughs to hold the horse.</p>
<p>Booth galloped into southern Maryland, arriving before dawn on April 15 at the home of <a href="Samuel_Mudd" title="wikilink">Dr. Samuel Mudd</a>, who treated the injured leg, which Booth told Mudd was broken when his horse fell.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The next day, Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby, Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones, who had been a Confederate agent in charge of spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> By order of Secretary of War <a href="Edwin_M._Stanton" title="wikilink">Edwin M. Stanton</a>, the War Department advertised a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices, and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively, following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to <a href="Lafayette_C._Baker" title="wikilink">Col. Layfayette Baker</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>While Federal troops combed the rural area's woods and swamps for Booth in the days following the assassination, the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On Tuesday morning, April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his walnut casket in the black-draped <a href="East_Room" title="wikilink">East Room</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the capital's lawn.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassination's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Historian <a href="Dorothy_Kunhardt" title="wikilink">Dorothy Kunhardt</a> wrote: </p>
<p>Even in the South, sorrow was expressed. In <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah, Georgia</a>, where the mayor and cite council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, many in the crowd wept.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act &quot;a disgrace to the age&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Others in the South feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states. &quot;Instead of being a great Southern hero, his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North&quot;, wrote Kunhardt.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>While hiding in the Maryland woods as he waited for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia, Booth read the accounts of national mourning reported by the newspapers, which were brought him by Jones each day.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Booth was surprised to find little public sympathy for his action, and wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, as he awaited nightfall before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia (<em>see map</em>): &quot;[W]ith every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what <a href="Marcus_Junius_Brutus#Influence" title="wikilink">Brutus</a> was honored for ... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>After six days hiding in the woods to avoid Federal patrols, Booth and Herald were provided with a boat and compass by Jones, to cross the Potomac at night on April 21.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A detachment of 25 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, led by Lieutenant <a href="Edward_P._Doherty" title="wikilink">Edward P. Doherty</a> and accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Everton_Conger" title="wikilink">Everton Conger</a>, pursued Booth through Southern Maryland, across the Potomac River and <a href="Rappahannock_River" title="wikilink">Rappahannock</a> Rivers, to Richard H. Garrett's farm, just south of <a href="Port_Royal,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Port Royal</a>, <a href="Caroline_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Caroline County, Virginia</a>. Booth and Herold had been led to the farm by William S. Jett, a former private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination; Booth was introduced to them as &quot;James W. Boyd&quot;, a Confederate soldier who, they were told, had been wounded in the <a href="Siege_of_Petersburg" title="wikilink">battle of Petersburg</a> and was returning home.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <img src="Garrett_Farm.gif" title="fig:The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865" alt="The porch of the Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died in 1865" /> Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Early in the morning of April 26, 1865, the soldiers caught up with Booth there. Trapped in a <a href="tobacco_barn" title="wikilink">tobacco barn</a>, David Herold surrendered.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying &quot;I prefer to come out and fight&quot;, and the soldiers then set the barn on fire.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant <a href="Boston_Corbett" title="wikilink">Boston Corbett</a> shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive &quot;raised his pistol to shoot&quot; at them.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Conger's report to Secretary Stanton, however, stated that Corbett shot Booth &quot;without order, pretext or excuse&quot;, and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, at age 26.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The bullet had severed his <a href="spinal_cord" title="wikilink">spinal cord</a>, <a href="paralysis" title="wikilink">paralyzing</a> him. In his last dying moments, he reportedly whispered &quot;tell my mother I died for my country&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Asking that his hands be raised to his face so he could see them, Booth uttered his <a href="Wikiquote:Last_words" title="wikilink">final words</a>, &quot;Useless, useless,&quot; and died as dawn was breaking.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women including his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Lucy Hale, and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, &quot;I struck boldly, and not as the papers say. I can never repent it, though we hated to kill. Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after Booth's death, his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia, &quot;Think no more of him as your brother; he is dead to us now, as he soon must be to all the world, but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit, in another world.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Asia also had in her possession a sealed letter which Booth had given her in January 1865 for safekeeping. Booth's letter, seized along with other family papers at Asia's house by Federal troops and published by the <a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink"><em>New York Times</em></a> while the manhunt was underway, explained his reasons for plotting against Lincoln. In it he said, &quot;I have ever held the South was right. The very nomination of Abraham Lincoln, four years ago, spoke plainly war upon Southern rights and institutions&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The institution of &quot;African slavery&quot;, he had written, &quot;is one of the greatest blessings that God has ever bestowed upon a favored nation&quot; and Lincoln's policy was one of &quot;total annihilation&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Among the identifying features used to make sure that the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a very distinct scar on the back of his neck.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The third, fourth, and fifth <a href="vertebrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">vertebrae</a> were removed during the autopsy to allow access to the bullet.

When the prison was razed in 1867, the body was moved to a warehouse on the Arsenal grounds. In 1869, the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at <a href="Green_Mount_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Green Mount Cemetery</a> in Baltimore, after a burial ceremony conducted by Fleming James, minister of Christ Episcopal Church.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1907, <a href="Finis_L._Bates" title="wikilink">Finis L.

Pegram, who had viewed Booth's remains upon the casket's arrival at the Weaver funeral home in Baltimore on February 18, 1869, for burial at Green Mount Cemetery. Pegram, who had known Booth well as a young man, submitted a sworn statement that the body he had seen in 1869 was Booth's.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Others positively identifying this body as Booth at the funeral home included Booth's mother, brother, and sister, along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="The_Lincoln_Conspiracy_(book)" title="wikilink"><em>The Lincoln Conspiracy</em></a> book published in 1977 contended there was a government plot to conceal Booth's escape, reviving interest in the story and prompting the display of St. Helen's mummified body in Chicago that year.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The book sold more than one million copies and was made into <a href="The_Lincoln_Conspiracy_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>The Lincoln Conspiracy</em> movie</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> A 1998 book, <em>The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth</em>, contended that Booth had escaped, sought refuge in Japan and eventually returned to the United States.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> In 1994, two historians and several Booth descendants sought a court order to exhume John Wilkes Booth's body at Green Mount Cemetery, &quot;... intended to prove or disprove longstanding theories on Booth's escape,&quot; said a lawyer speaking for them, by conducting a photo-superimposition analysis.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> This was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H.H.
