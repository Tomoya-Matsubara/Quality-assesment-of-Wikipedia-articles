<p>The <strong>Twa</strong> are any of several <a href="hunter-gatherer" title="wikilink">hunting</a> peoples or <a href="caste" title="wikilink">castes</a> of Africa who live interdependently with agricultural <a href="Bantu_people" title="wikilink">Bantu</a> populations, and generally hold a socially subordinate position: They provide the farming population with <a href="game_(food)" title="wikilink">game</a> in exchange for agricultural products.</p>
<p>The <a href="Bantu_languages" title="wikilink">Bantu</a> term <em><a href="abatwa" title="wikilink">Twa</a></em> (see) is generally translated as &quot;<a href="Pygmy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pygmy</a>&quot;. However, in the Western conception &quot;Pygmies&quot; are short forest people, whereas southern Twa populations do not live in the forest and may not be shorter than the farming/village population, generally not reaching the anthropological definition of &quot;Pygmy&quot; as males averaging less than 150 cm. Outside of the rainforest, the Twa may be taller than the classic Pygmy, and there may be less difference in physical appearance&lt;U+2014&gt;in some cases none. Nonetheless, the 'despised' relationship between the farmer patron and the hunter client is similar to that of the forest.</p>
<p>No Pygmy or Twa population is known to live independently of agriculture, and all live near or in agricultural villages. Agricultural Bantu peoples have settled a number of <a href="ecotone" title="wikilink">ecotones</a> (the margins between ecosystems) next to an area that has game but will not support agriculture, such as the edges of the rainforest, open swamp, and desert, and the Twa spend part of the year in the otherwise uninhabited region hunting game, being provided with agricultural food by the farmers while they do so.</p>
<p>Roger Blench has proposed that Twa (Pygmies) originated as a <a href="caste" class="uri" title="wikilink">caste</a> like they are today, much like the <a href="Blacksmiths_of_western_Africa" title="wikilink"><em>Numu</em> blacksmith castes of West Africa</a>, economically specialized groups which became <a href="endogamous" class="uri" title="wikilink">endogamous</a> and consequently developed into separate ethnic groups, sometimes, as with the <a href="Ligbi_language" title="wikilink">Ligbi</a>, with their own languages. A mismatch in language between patron and client could later occur from population displacements. The short stature of the &quot;forest people&quot; could have developed in the few millennia since the <a href="Bantu_expansion" title="wikilink">Bantu expansion</a>, as also happened with Bantu domestic animals in the rainforest, especially if there was additional selective pressure from farmers taking the tallest women back to the village as wives, as happens today. However, that is incidental to the social identity of the Pygmy/Twa.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It is often supposed that the Pygmies were the aboriginal inhabitants of the forest before the advent of agriculture. However, <a href="Jan_Vansina" title="wikilink">Vansina</a> argues that the original meaning of the (<a href="Proto-Bantu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proto-Bantu</a>) word *Twa was <em><a href="hunter-gatherer" class="uri" title="wikilink">hunter-gatherer</a></em> (&quot;bushpeople&quot;), and that this became conflated with another root for Twa/Pygmy, *Yaka (as in <a href="Bayaka" title="wikilink">Ba-Yaka</a>).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As the Twa caste developed into full-time hunter-gatherers, the words were conflated, and the ritual role of the absorbed aboriginal peoples<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> was transferred to the Twa.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="congo">Congo</h2>

<p>Twa live scattered throughout the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" title="wikilink">Congo</a>. In addition to the <a href="Great_Lakes_Twa" title="wikilink">Great Lakes Twa</a> of the dense forests under the <a href="Ruwenzori" title="wikilink">Ruwenzoris</a>, there are notable populations in the <a href="Western_Congolian_swamp_forests" title="wikilink">swamp forest</a> around <a href="Lake_Tumba" title="wikilink">Lake Tumba</a> in the west (about 14,000 Twa, more than the Great Lakes Twa in all countries), in the forest&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="savanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">savanna</a> swamps of <a href="Kasai-Occidental" title="wikilink">Kasai</a> in the south-center, and in the savanna swamps scattered throughout <a href="Katanga_(province)" title="wikilink">Katanga</a> in the south-east, as in the <a href="Upemba_Depression" title="wikilink">Upemba Depression</a> with its <a href="floating_island" title="wikilink">floating islands</a>, and around <a href="Kiambi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kiambi</a> on the <a href="Luvua_River" title="wikilink">Luvua River</a>.</p>
<p>Arab and colonial accounts speak of Twa on either side of the <a href="Lomami_River" title="wikilink">Lomami River</a> southwest of <a href="Kisangani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kisangani</a>, and on the <a href="Tshuapa_River" title="wikilink">Tshuapa River</a> and its tributary the &quot;Bussera&quot;.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="Mongo_people" title="wikilink">Mongo</a>, on the rare occasions of caste mixing, the child is raised as Twa. If this is a common pattern with Twa groups, it may explain why the Twa are less physically distinct from their patrons than the Mbenga and Mbuti, where village men take Pygmy women out of the forest as wives.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Congolese variant of the name, at least in Mongo, Kasai, and Katanga, is <em>Cwa</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="angola-and-namibia">Angola and Namibia</h2>
<p>Southern <a href="Angola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angola</a> through central <a href="Namibia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Namibia</a> had Twa populations when Europeans first arrived in the 16th century. Estermann writes,  These peoples live in desert environments. Accounts are limited and tend to confuse the Twa with the <a href="San_people" title="wikilink">San</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="zambia-and-botswana">Zambia and Botswana</h2>

<p>The Twa of these countries live is swampy areas, such as the Twa fishermen of the <a href="Bangweulu_Swamps" title="wikilink">Bangweulu Swamps</a>, <a href="Lukanga_Swamp" title="wikilink">Lukanga Swamp</a>, and <a href="Kafue_Flats" title="wikilink">Kafue Flats</a> of <a href="Zambia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zambia</a>; only the Twa fish in <a href="Southern_Province,_Zambia" title="wikilink">Southern Province</a>, where the swampy terrain means that large-scale crops cannot be planted near the best fishing grounds.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Cavalli-Sforza also shows Twa near <a href="Lake_Mweru" title="wikilink">Lake Mweru</a> on the Zambia&lt;U+2013&gt;Congo border. There are two obvious possibilities: the <a href="Luapula_Swamps" title="wikilink">Luapula Swamps</a>, and the swamps of <a href="Lake_Mweru_Wantipa" title="wikilink">Lake Mweru Wantipa</a>. The latter is Taabwa territory, and the Twa are reported to live among the Taabwa.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The former is reported to be the territory of Bemba-speaking Twa.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="south-africa">South Africa</h2>
<p>In <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> the term <em><a href="Abatwa" title="wikilink">Twa</a></em> is applied to the <a href="San_people" title="wikilink">San</a>, the former hunter-gatherers of the region who are unrelated to the Pygmies.</p>
