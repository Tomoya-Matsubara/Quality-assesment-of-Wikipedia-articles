<p><em>Not to be confused with <a href="Augustine_of_Hippo" title="wikilink">Augustine of Hippo</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Augustine of Canterbury</strong> (<em><a href="circa" class="uri" title="wikilink">circa</a></em> first third of the 6th century &lt;U+2013&gt; 26 May 604) was a <a href="Benedictine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> <a href="monk" class="uri" title="wikilink">monk</a> who became the first <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in the year 598. He is considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot; and a founder of the English Church.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine was the <a href="prior" class="uri" title="wikilink">prior</a> of a monastery in Rome when Pope <a href="Pope_Gregory_I" title="wikilink">Gregory the Great</a> chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the <a href="Gregorian_mission" title="wikilink">Gregorian mission</a>, to Britain to convert the <a href="Paganism" title="wikilink">pagan</a> King <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht_of_Kent" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht</a> of the <a href="Kingdom_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Kent</a> to <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>. Kent was probably chosen because it was near the Christian kingdoms in <a href="Gaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaul</a> and because &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht had married a Christian princess, <a href="Bertha_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Bertha</a>, daughter of <a href="Charibert_I" title="wikilink">Charibert I</a> the <a href="List_of_Frankish_kings" title="wikilink">King of Paris</a> who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent the missionaries had considered turning back but Gregory urged them on and, in 597, Augustine landed on the <a href="Isle_of_Thanet" title="wikilink">Isle of Thanet</a> and proceeded to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's main town of Canterbury.</p>
<p>King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated bishop of the English and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on <a href="Christmas" title="wikilink">Christmas Day</a> in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native <a href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train <a href="Anglo-Saxons" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor, <a href="Laurence_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Laurence of Canterbury</a>. The archbishop died in 604 and was soon revered as a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background-to-the-mission">Background to the mission</h2>
<p>After the withdrawal of the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman</a> <a href="Roman_legion" title="wikilink">legions</a> from the province of Britannia in 410, the natives of the province were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the Saxons. Before the withdrawal Britannia had been converted to Christianity and had even produced its own heretic in <a href="Pelagius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pelagius</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Britain sent three bishops to the <a href="Council_of_Arles" title="wikilink">Council of Arles</a> in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After the legions left, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island, but western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native <a href="Celtic_Christianity" title="wikilink">British Church</a> developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of <a href="Easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Easter</a> and the style of the <a href="tonsure" class="uri" title="wikilink">tonsure</a> haircut that clerics wore.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of <a href="Saint_Alban" title="wikilink">Saint Alban</a> and the occurrence in place names of <em>eccles</em>, derived from the Latin <em>ecclesia</em>, meaning &quot;church&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilization in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the <a href="Anglo-Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxons</a> to Christianity in 595.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, who had married a Christian princess named <a href="Bertha_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Bertha</a> before 588,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and perhaps earlier than 560.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Bertha was the daughter of <a href="Charibert_I" title="wikilink">Charibert I</a>, one of the <a href="Merovingian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merovingian</a> kings of the <a href="Franks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Franks</a>. As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named <a href="Liudhard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liudhard</a> with her to Kent.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;possibly the current <a href="St_Martin&#39;s_Church,_Canterbury" title="wikilink">St Martin's Church, Canterbury</a>. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht was a <a href="Anglo-Saxon_paganism" title="wikilink">pagan</a> at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>, an eighth-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{#tag:ref|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>|group=notes}}<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, were probably involved.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the <a href="Lombards" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lombards</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Aside from &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was proving to be the dominant power in south-eastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King <a href="Ceawlin_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">Ceawlin of Wessex</a> in 592, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a> refers to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht as having <a href="imperium" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperium</a> (overlordship) south of the <a href="Humber" title="wikilink">River Humber</a>. Trade between the Franks and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the <a href="language_barrier" title="wikilink">language barrier</a> between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the <a href="San_Gregorio_Magno_al_Celio" title="wikilink">abbey of St Andrew's</a> in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King <a href="Theuderic_II" title="wikilink">Theuderic II</a> of <a href="Burgundy_(region)" title="wikilink">Burgundy</a> and to King <a href="Theudebert_II" title="wikilink">Theudebert II</a> of <a href="Austrasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austrasia</a>, as well as their grandmother <a href="Brunhilda_of_Austrasia" title="wikilink">Brunhild</a>, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King <a href="Chlothar_II" title="wikilink">Chlothar II</a> of <a href="Neustria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neustria</a> for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission who visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, so Augustine was evidently well-educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine established his <a href="episcopal_see" title="wikilink">episcopal see</a> at Canterbury.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop &lt;U+00C6&gt;therius of <a href="Arles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arles</a> after the conversion of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one ten months later says that Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The historian R. A.

<p>Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> of Saints <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Peter</a> and <a href="Paul_the_Apostle" title="wikilink">Paul</a>, which later became <a href="St_Augustine&#39;s_Abbey" title="wikilink">St Augustine's Abbey</a>,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> on land donated by the king.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This foundation has often been claimed as the first <a href="Benedictine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the <a href="Rule_of_St._Benedict" title="wikilink">Rule of St. Benedict</a> into England, but there is no evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In a letter Gregory wrote to the <a href="patriarch_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">patriarch of Alexandria</a> in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Little literary traces remain of them, however.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his <em><a href="Historia_ecclesiastica_gentis_Anglorum" title="wikilink">Ecclesiastical History</a></em>, this section of the <em>History</em> is usually known as the <em><a href="Libellus_responsionum" title="wikilink">Libellus responsionum</a></em>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops.

The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> but it was probably because London was not part of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's domains.

Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, <a href="Mellitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mellitus</a> as <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a> and <a href="Justus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justus</a> as <a href="Bishop_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Rochester</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, &quot;recovered&quot; a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The actual Latin is from Chapter 33, Book 1 of Bede, and an online version is <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33">here</a>. The sentence in question is &quot;AT Augustinus, ubi in regia ciuitate sedem episcopalem, ut praediximus, accepit, recuperauit in ea, regio fultus adminiculo, ecclesiam, quam inibi antiquo Romanorum fidelium opere factam fuisse didicerat, et eam in nomine sancti Saluatoris Dei et Domini nostri Iesu Christi sacrauit, atque ibidem sibi habitationem statuit et cunctis successoribus suis.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The Latin word <em>recuperauit</em> could be translated either &quot;repaired&quot; or &quot;recovered&quot;. Sherley-Price translates the sentence as &quot;Having been granted his episcopal see in the royal capital, as already recorded, Augustine proceeded with the king's help to repair a church he was informed had been built long ago by Roman Christians.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a>|group=notes}} It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the <a href="Romano-British" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romano-British</a> period were uncovered just south of the present <a href="Canterbury_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Canterbury Cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a> and <a href="Dumnonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dumnonia</a> to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organization survived in the Britain than was actually the case.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In 603, Augustine and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting. These guests retired early to confer with their people,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> they refused to recognise him as archbishop.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the <a href="tonsure" class="uri" title="wikilink">tonsure</a>, the observance of <a href="Easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Easter</a>, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="further-success">Further success</h2>
<p>Easier to implement were Rome's mandates concerning pagan temples and celebrations. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman <a href="Pope_Sixtus_II" title="wikilink">St Sixtus</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="The_King&#39;s_School,_Canterbury" title="wikilink">The King's School, Canterbury</a> claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the <a href="East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglian</a> mission.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Augustine received <a href="liturgical_book" title="wikilink">liturgical books</a> from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> language liturgy in use at Rome.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and legacy</h2>

Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a> the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> After the Conquest, his <a href="shrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">shrine</a> in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and <a href="Mellitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mellitus</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> King <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I of England</a> granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six day <a href="fair" class="uri" title="wikilink">fair</a> around the date on which Augustine's relics were <a href="Translation_(relics)" title="wikilink">translated</a> to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>A life of Augustine was written by <a href="Goscelin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goscelin</a> around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> These authors included <a href="William_of_Malmesbury" title="wikilink">William of Malmesbury</a>, who claimed that Augustine founded <a href="Cerne_Abbey" title="wikilink">Cerne Abbey</a>,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> the author (generally believed to be <a href="John_Brompton" title="wikilink">John Brompton</a>) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their <a href="Romance_(genre)" title="wikilink">romances</a>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and <a href="Augustine_of_Hippo" title="wikilink">Augustine of Hippo</a>, a fourth century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> During the <a href="English_Reformation" title="wikilink">English Reformation</a>, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, a Celtic cross marks the spot in <a href="Ebbsfleet,_Thanet" title="wikilink">Ebbsfleet, Thanet</a>, <a href="East_Kent" title="wikilink">East Kent</a>, where Augustine is said to have landed,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> although historian Alan Kay told the BBC in 2005 that Augustine actually landed somewhere between Stonar and <a href="Sandwich,_Kent" title="wikilink">Sandwich</a>. According to Kay, Ebbsfleet was not on the coast in the 6th century. The story that Augustine landed there was started in 1884, he said, by a Victorian aristocrat who needed a publicity stunt to draw people to his newly opened tea rooms.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
