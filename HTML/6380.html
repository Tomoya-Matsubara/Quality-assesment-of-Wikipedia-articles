<p><strong><em>Megalonyx jeffersonii</em></strong>, or <strong>Jefferson's ground sloth</strong>, is an extinct <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of <a href="giant_ground_sloth" title="wikilink">giant ground sloth</a> that lived from the <a href="Illinoian_glaciation" title="wikilink">Illinoian glaciation</a> during the <a href="Middle_Pleistocene" title="wikilink">Middle Pleistocene</a> (150,000 years <a href="Before_present" title="wikilink">BP</a>) through to the <a href="Rancholabrean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rancholabrean</a> of the <a href="Late_Pleistocene" title="wikilink">Late Pleistocene</a> (10,000 BC). It was the last surviving member of the family <a href="Megalonychidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megalonychidae</a>.</p>
<p>This species ranged widely in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>. It belongs to the genus <em><a href="Megalonyx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megalonyx</a></em>, a name proposed by <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; future president of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; in 1797. (Jefferson's surname was appended to the animal as the <a href="specific_epithet" title="wikilink">specific epithet</a> in 1822 by the French zoologist <a href="Anselme_Ga&lt;U+00EB&gt;tan_Desmarest" title="wikilink">Anselme Ga&lt;U+00EB&gt;tan Desmarest</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><em>M. jeffersonii</em> was a large, heavily built animal about 8 to 10 feet (2.5-3 m) long. Its maximum weight may have been as much as 800 pounds (360 kg). This is medium-sized among the giant ground sloths. Like other ground sloths it had a blunt snout, massive jaw, and large peg-like teeth. The hind limbs were <a href="plantigrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">plantigrade</a> (flat-footed) and this, along with its stout tail, allowed it to rear up into a semi-erect position to feed on tree leaves. The forelimbs had three highly developed claws that were probably used to strip leaves and tear off branches.</p>
<h2 id="range">Range</h2>
<p><em>M. jeffersonii</em> was apparently the most wide ranging giant ground sloth. Fossils are known from many Pleistocene sites in the United States, including most of the states east of the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> as well as along the west coast. It was the only ground sloth to range as far north as the present-day <a href="Yukon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yukon</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="jeffersons-certain-bones">Jefferson's &quot;Certain Bones&quot;</h3>
<p>In <a href="1796" class="uri" title="wikilink">1796</a>, Colonel <a href="Stuart,_John_(Virginia)" title="wikilink">John Stuart</a> sent <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> some fossil bones (a <a href="femur" class="uri" title="wikilink">femur</a> fragment, <a href="ulna" class="uri" title="wikilink">ulna</a>, <a href="radius" class="uri" title="wikilink">radius</a>, and some foot bones including three large claws) from a cave in Greenbrier County, Virginia (present-day <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a>). In <a href="1797" class="uri" title="wikilink">1797</a>, Jefferson presented a paper on &quot;Certain Bones&quot; to the <a href="American_Philosophical_Society" title="wikilink">American Philosophical Society</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct <a href="lion" class="uri" title="wikilink">lion</a> which he named <em>Megalonyx</em> (&quot;giant claw&quot;).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Jefferson is considered to have initiated the science of <a href="vertebrate_paleontology" title="wikilink">vertebrate paleontology</a> in the United States with the reading of this paper. In <a href="1799" class="uri" title="wikilink">1799</a>, Dr. <a href="Caspar_Wistar_(physician)" title="wikilink">Caspar Wistar</a> correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In <a href="1822" class="uri" title="wikilink">1822</a> Wistar proposed naming it <em>Megalonyx jeffersonii</em> in honor of the former president.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Desmarest then published it as such.</p>
<h3 id="which-cave">Which cave?</h3>
<p>For many decades, Jefferson's &quot;Certain Bones&quot; had been assumed to have come from <a href="Organ_Cave" title="wikilink">Organ Cave</a> in what is now <a href="Greenbrier_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Greenbrier County, West Virginia</a>. In 1993, two fragments of a <em>Megalonyx</em> <a href="scapula" class="uri" title="wikilink">scapula</a> were found in <a href="Haynes_Cave" title="wikilink">Haynes Cave</a> in neighboring <a href="Monroe_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Monroe County</a>. In 1995, <a href="Smithsonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smithsonian</a> <a href="paleontologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">paleontologist</a> Frederick Grady proposed<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> that Haynes Cave was the true original source of Jefferson's fossil.</p>
<p>Grady&lt;U+2019&gt;s reasons had to do with historical land-ownership records. Jefferson reported that the bones had been found by <a href="saltpeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">saltpeter</a> workers and gave the cave owner&lt;U+2019&gt;s name as Frederic Crower, an apparent mis-spelling (according to Grady) of Frederic Gromer. Correspondence between Jefferson and Colonel Stuart, who sent him the bones, indicates that the cave was about five miles from Stuart&lt;U+2019&gt;s home and contained saltpeter vats. Grady believes that Organ Cave can be eliminated as the source cave as it was never owned by Gromer. In addition, two letters written by the subsequent owner of the cave -- Tristram Patton -- indicate that the cave was in Monroe County near Second Creek. (Monroe County, originally part of Greenbrier County, was separated shortly after the discovery of the bones.) In the letters, Patton described the cave and indicated that more bones were there.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Today, the proprietors of Organ Cave continue to insist on their property as the origin of the fossil in their interpretative exhibits and tour guide presentations.</p>
<p><em>M. jeffersonii</em> is still the most commonly identified species of <em>Megalonyx</em>. It was designated the <a href="List_of_U.S._state_fossils" title="wikilink">state fossil</a> of <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a> in 2008.</p>
