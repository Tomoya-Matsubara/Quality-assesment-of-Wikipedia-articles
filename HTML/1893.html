<p><a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <strong>Sir Thomas Astley Cubitt</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">KCB</a> <a href="Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George" title="wikilink">CMG</a> <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">DSO</a> (9 April 1871 - 19 May 1939) was a <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> officer of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who commanded a division in the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> and in retirement served as <a href="Governor_of_Bermuda" title="wikilink">Governor of Bermuda</a>.</p>
<p>Cubitt was the youngest son of a family of rural gentry in Norfolk, who joined the <a href="Royal_Artillery" title="wikilink">Royal Artillery</a> in 1891. He requested colonial service, and spent five years in Africa, where he was involved in the creation of the <a href="West_African_Frontier_Force" title="wikilink">West African Frontier Force</a> and served in a number of campaigns in northern Nigeria. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, he was appointed as <a href="Deputy_Commissioner" title="wikilink">Deputy Commissioner</a> in <a href="Somaliland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somaliland</a>, where he mounted a series of campaigns against the <a href="Dervish_State" title="wikilink">Dervish State</a>.</p>
<p>He requested a transfer to the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> in 1916, and commanded an infantry battalion and a brigade before being promoted to take command of <a href="38th_(Welsh)_Division" title="wikilink">38th (Welsh) Division</a> in early 1918. He led the division until the Armistice, with marked success. Following the war, he held a series of peacetime commands in Germany, Egypt, and England, before being made <a href="Governor_of_Bermuda" title="wikilink">Governor of Bermuda</a> in 1931. He held this position until 1936, when he retired.</p>
<h2 id="family-and-early-career">Family and early career</h2>
<p>Born at Great Yarmouth on 9 April 1871, Thomas was the third son of <a href="Major" class="uri" title="wikilink">Major</a> Frank Astley Cubitt and his wife Bertha, daughter of <a href="Captain_(Royal_Navy)" title="wikilink">Captain</a> Thomas Blakiston of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>. The family resided at Thorpe Hall in <a href="Norwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norwich</a>, with an estate at <a href="Fritton_(near_Great_Yarmouth)" title="wikilink">Fritton</a>, near <a href="Great_Yarmouth" title="wikilink">Great Yarmouth</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Major Cubitt came from a family of rural gentry, and had attended <a href="Rugby_School" title="wikilink">Rugby</a> and <a href="Jesus_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Jesus College, Cambridge</a> before entering the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> in 1853 as an ensign in the <a href="5th_Regiment_of_Foot" title="wikilink">5th Regiment of Foot</a>. He saw service in the <a href="Indian_Mutiny" title="wikilink">Indian Mutiny</a> before returning to England to act as <a href="adjutant" class="uri" title="wikilink">adjutant</a> to volunteer battalions of the <a href="Norfolk_Regiment" title="wikilink">Norfolk Regiment</a>, and retired from the Army in 1889. He later served as a <a href="Justice_of_the_Peace" title="wikilink">Justice of the Peace</a> and chair of the local district council.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Cubitt's eldest brother, <a href="Bertram_Blakiston_Cubitt" title="wikilink">Bertram Blakiston</a> (b. 1862), attended <a href="Balliol_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Balliol College, Oxford</a> before entering the civil service; he would later serve as the private secretary to the <a href="Conservative" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> politicians <a href="Edward_Stanhope" title="wikilink">Edward Stanhope</a>, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for War</a>, in 1890-91, and <a href="St_John_Brodrick,_1st_Earl_of_Midleton" title="wikilink">St John Brodrick</a>, <a href="Under-Secretary_of_State_for_War" title="wikilink">Under-Secretary of State for War</a>, in 1896-98. He was knighted in 1920.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The middle brother, Julian Francis (b. 1869) studied at <a href="Selwyn_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Selwyn College, Cambridge</a>, but does not appear to have had an active public career.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Their one sister, Helen, married a German economist, Dr. <a href="Moritz_Julius_Bonn" title="wikilink">Moritz Julius Bonn</a>, in 1903.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Thomas Cubitt attended <a href="Haileybury_and_Imperial_Service_College" title="wikilink">Haileybury</a>, as his brother Julian had done, but rather than attend university he studied at the <a href="Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich" title="wikilink">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>, before being <a href="Commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">commissioned</a> into the <a href="Royal_Artillery" title="wikilink">Royal Artillery</a> in 1891.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After service in India, and a course at the <a href="Staff_College,_Camberley" title="wikilink">Staff College, Camberley</a>, he requested a transfer to a colonial posting. He was sent to <a href="West_Africa" title="wikilink">West Africa</a> in 1898, and appointed as commander of the artillery in the <a href="Northern_Nigeria_Protectorate" title="wikilink">Northern Nigeria Protectorate</a> on its formation in 1900, alongside a promotion to <a href="Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)" title="wikilink">Captain</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Whilst in Nigeria, he was closely involved in the formation of the <a href="Nigeria_Regiment" title="wikilink">Nigeria Regiment</a> in the <a href="West_African_Frontier_Force" title="wikilink">West African Frontier Force</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and saw active duty in a number of expeditions between 1900 and 1903,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> culminating in the command of a battalion of <a href="mounted_infantry" title="wikilink">mounted infantry</a> during the <a href="Kano-Sokoto_campaign" title="wikilink">Kano-Sokoto campaign</a> of 1903.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> For his service in Africa, he was <a href="mentioned_in_despatches" title="wikilink">mentioned in despatches</a> several times, awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a>, and promoted to the <a href="brevet_rank" title="wikilink">brevet rank</a> of Major.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>He returned to regimental duties in the United Kingdom in 1905, and from 1908 to 1911 he served as a <a href="Brigade_Major" title="wikilink">Brigade Major</a> in Ireland with <a href="3rd_Cavalry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">3rd Cavalry Brigade</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="first-world-war">First World War</h2>
<p>In July 1914, Cubitt was appointed <a href="Deputy_Commissioner" title="wikilink">Deputy Commissioner</a> and Officer Commanding for the <a href="British_Somaliland" title="wikilink">Somaliland Protectorate</a>; after the disastrous <a href="Battle_of_Dul_Madoba" title="wikilink">Battle of Dul Madoba</a>, the colonial administration was seeking to restore British control over the inland areas of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested to be transferred to Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and make his way home.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> For his services in Africa, he was appointed a <a href="Companion_of_the_Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> and a <a href="Companion_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">Companion of the Bath</a>, and promoted to brevet Colonel.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Cubitt turned down the opportunity of a staff posting on the Western Front to request a front-line command,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and briefly commanded the 8th (Service) Battalion of the <a href="Lincolnshire_Regiment" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire Regiment</a> in early 1917<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> before assuming command of <a href="19th_(Western)_Division#57th_Brigade" title="wikilink">57th Brigade</a> in April. The brigade saw service at <a href="Battle_of_Messines" title="wikilink">Messines</a> and <a href="Third_Battle_of_Ypres" title="wikilink">Ypres</a> in 1917, and in the <a href="Spring_Offensive" title="wikilink">Spring Offensive</a> of early 1918.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He was then appointed to take command of <a href="38th_(Welsh)_Division" title="wikilink">38th (Welsh) Division</a> in late May or early June 1918,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> after its previous commander, <a href="Charles_Blackader" title="wikilink">Charles Blackader</a>, had fallen ill.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>An officer in one of the 38th's infantry battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as &quot;a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and a gleam in his eye&quot;, who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A &quot;fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language&quot;,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely &quot;a magnificent gush of language&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A colleague from his early days in the Artillery described him as a &quot;perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion&quot;,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they &quot;damn well had to do the raid over again, and damn well see that [they] made a proper job of it, or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [they] damn well did.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a &quot;contemptible exhibition&quot; for a senior officer to make.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Regardless of his personal style, Cubitt was credited by <a href="Douglas_Haig" title="wikilink">Douglas Haig</a> with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but very costly attack in April 1918; under his command, it mounted two further major operations, at the <a href="Battle_of_Albert_(1918)" title="wikilink">Battle of Albert</a> in August and <a href="Battle_of_Cambrai_(1918)" title="wikilink">Battle of Cambrai</a> in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, and a highly effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank it as one of the most effective British divisions during the <a href="Hundred_Days_Offensive" title="wikilink">Hundred Days Offensive</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="postwar-career">Postwar career</h2>
<p>Cubitt remained with the 38th Division until the end of the war, and in May 1919 was transferred to command <a href="3rd_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">3rd Infantry Brigade</a> in the <a href="British_Army_of_the_Rhine" title="wikilink">British Army of the Rhine</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Shortly afterwards, in August, he was posted to take over the demobilising <a href="54th_(East_Anglian)_Division" title="wikilink">54th (East Anglian) Division</a> in Egypt, remaining with them until October, when the final units sailed for England.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920, he was appointed to command the <a href="Madras_Presidency" title="wikilink">Presidency</a> and <a href="Assam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assam</a> District in eastern India.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The same year, he married Mary Grissell (ne&lt;U+00E9&gt; Wood), the widow of an officer in the Norfolk Regiment. He returned to England in 1924, remaining on half-pay until he took command of the <a href="53rd_(Welsh)_Division" title="wikilink">53rd (Welsh) Division</a>, a <a href="Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Territorial Army</a> formation, in 1927. In 1928, he transferred to the command of the <a href="2nd_Division_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">2nd Division</a>, a regular formation, and was promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1930.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1931, he was knighted and appointed <a href="Governor_of_Bermuda" title="wikilink">Governor of Bermuda</a>, holding the post for five years before retiring in 1936. He was promoted to full General in 1935, and from 1931 to his death held the ceremonial position of <a href="colonel_commandant" title="wikilink">colonel commandant</a> of the Royal Artillery.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Cubitt died on 19 May 1939, leaving an estate of &lt;U+00A3&gt;19,000.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
