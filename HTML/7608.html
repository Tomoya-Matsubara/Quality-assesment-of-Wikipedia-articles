<p><strong>Bernard Kabanda</strong> (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1999) was a <a href="Ugandan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ugandan</a> guitarist. He had just realised fame in the world music circuit through his appearances at <a href="WOMAD" class="uri" title="wikilink">WOMAD</a> in the USA and the UK in 1999 before he died of AIDS less than two months after his performance at Womad's <a href="Womad_Reading" title="wikilink">Reading</a> festival, aged only 40.</p>
<p>Before he died, he recorded an album with Womad, called <em>Olugendo</em>.</p>
<p>He was discovered in the streets of <a href="Kampala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kampala</a>, Uganda's capital, playing on a guitar he had made himself out of scrap. He was content to play solo, or with simple tin-can percussion as he played in pubs in Kampala, and he did so also in his Womad tour, where he played with Samuel Bakkabulindi, who played make-shift shakers and tin-cans with drum sticks.</p>
