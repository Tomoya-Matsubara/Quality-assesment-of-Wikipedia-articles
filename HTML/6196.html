<p>The <strong>Norwegian Sea</strong> () is a <a href="marginal_sea" title="wikilink">marginal sea</a> in the <a href="North_Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Ocean</a>, northwest of <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>. It is located between the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> (i.e. north of <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>) and the <a href="Greenland_Sea" title="wikilink">Greenland Sea</a> and adjoins the North <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the west and the <a href="Barents_Sea" title="wikilink">Barents Sea</a> to the northeast. In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> and the <a href="Faroe_Islands" title="wikilink">Faroe Islands</a>. To the North, the <a href="Jan_Mayen" title="wikilink">Jan Mayen</a> Ridge separates it from the <a href="Greenland_Sea" title="wikilink">Greenland Sea</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike many other seas, most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a <a href="continental_shelf" title="wikilink">continental shelf</a> and therefore lies at a great depth of about two kilometers on average. Rich deposits of oil and <a href="natural_gas" title="wikilink">natural gas</a> are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially, in the areas with the sea depths of up to about one kilometer. The coastal zones are rich in fish that visits the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic for <a href="Spawn_(biology)" title="wikilink">spawning</a>. The warm <a href="North_Atlantic_Current" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Current</a> ensures relatively stable and high water temperatures, so that contrary to the Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice free throughout the year.</p>

This continental slope contains rich fishing grounds and numerous <a href="coral_reef" title="wikilink">coral reefs</a>. Settling of the shelf after the separation of the continents had resulted in <a href="landslide" title="wikilink">landslides</a>, such as the <a href="Storegga_Slide" title="wikilink">Storegga Slide</a> about 8,000 years ago that induced a major <a href="tsunami" class="uri" title="wikilink">tsunami</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The coasts of the Norwegian Sea were shaped during the last <a href="Ice_Age" title="wikilink">Ice Age</a>. So, large, several kilometer tall <a href="glacier" title="wikilink">glaciers</a> pushed into the land forming fjords, removing the crust into the sea and thereby extending the continental slopes.

The warm, salty <a href="North_Atlantic_Current" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Current</a> flows in from the Atlantic Ocean, and the colder and less saline <a href="Norwegian_Current" title="wikilink">Norwegian Current</a> originates in the North Sea. The so-called East Iceland Current transports cold water south from the Norwegian Sea towards Iceland and then east, along the <a href="Arctic_Circle" title="wikilink">Arctic Circle</a>; this current occurs in the middle water layer. Deep water flows into the Norwegian Sea from the Greenland Sea.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The tides in the sea are semi-diurnal, that is they rise twice a day to the height of about 3.3 meters.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="surface-currents">Surface currents</h4>
<p>The hydrology of the upper water layers is largely determined by the flow from the North Atlantic. It reaches the speed of 10 <a href="Sverdrup" title="wikilink">Sv</a> (1 Sv = million m<sup>3</sup>/s) and its maximum depth is 700 meters at the Lofoten Islands, but normally it is within 500 meters.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Part of it comes through the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and has a comparatively high <a href="salinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">salinity</a> of 35.3&lt;U+2030&gt; (parts per thousand). This current originates in the North Atlantic Current and passes along the European continental slope; increased evaporation due to the warm European climate results in the elevated salinity. Another part passes through the Greenland-Scotland-trench between the Faroe Islands and <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>; this water has a mean salinity between 35 and 35.2&lt;U+2030&gt;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The flow shows strong seasonal variations and can be twice higher in winter than in summer.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> While at the Faeroe-Shetland Channel it has a temperature of about 9.5 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C, it cools down to about 5 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C at Svalbard and releases this energy (about 250 terawatt) to the environment.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The current flowing from the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> originates in the Baltic Sea and thus collects most of the drainage from northern Europe; this contribution is however relatively small.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The temperature and salinity of this current shows strong seasonal and annual fluctuations. Long-term measurements within the top 50 meters near the coast result in a maximum temperature of 11.2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C at the 63&lt;U+00B0&gt; N <a href="Circle_of_latitude" title="wikilink">parallel</a> in September and a minimum of 3.9 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C at North Cape in March. The salinity varies between 34.3 and 34.6&lt;U+2030&gt; and is the lowest in spring owing to the inflow of the melted snow by the rivers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The largest rivers discharging into the sea are <a href="Namsen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Namsen</a>, <a href="Ranelva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ranelva</a> and <a href="Vefsna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vefsna</a>. They are all relatively short, but have a high discharge rate owing to their steep mountainous nature.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Some part of warm surface water flows directly, within the <a href="West_Spitsbergen_Current" title="wikilink">West Spitsbergen Current</a>, from the Atlantic Ocean, off the Greenland Sea, to the Arctic Ocean. This current has a speed of 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 Sv and has a large impact on the climate.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Other surface water (~1 Sv) flows along the Norwegian coast in the direction of the <a href="Barents_Sea" title="wikilink">Barents Sea</a>. This water may cool in the Norwegian Sea enough do submerge into the deeper layers; there it displaces water which flows back into the North Atlantic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Arctic water from the East Iceland Current is mostly found in the southwestern part of the sea, near Greenland. Its properties also show significant annual fluctuations in its properties, with the long-term average temperature below 3 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C and salinity of 34.7&lt;U+2013&gt;34.9&lt;U+2030&gt;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The fraction of this water on the sea surface depends on the strength of the current, which in turn depends on the pressure difference between the <a href="Icelandic_Low" title="wikilink">Icelandic Low</a> and <a href="Azores_High" title="wikilink">Azores High</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the larger the difference, the stronger the current.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="deep-sea-currents">Deep-sea currents</h4>
<p>The Norwegian Sea is connected with the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean by the 2,600-meter deep <a href="Fram_Strait" title="wikilink">Fram Strait</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) occurs at depths exceeding 2,000 meters; this homogeneous layer with a salinity of 34.91&lt;U+2030&gt; experiences little exchange with the adjacent seas. Its temperature is below 0 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C and drops to &lt;U+2212&gt;1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C at the ocean floor.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Compared with the deep waters of the surrounding seas, NSDW has more nutrients, but less oxygen and is relatively old.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The weak deep-water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean is due to the small depth of the relatively flat <a href="Greenland-Scotland_Ridge" title="wikilink">Greenland-Scotland Ridge</a> between Scotland and Greenland, an offshoot of the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. Only four areas of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge are deeper than 500 meters: the <a href="Faroe_Bank_Channel" title="wikilink">Faroe Bank Channel</a> (about 850 meters), some parts of the <a href="Iceland-Faroe_Ridge" title="wikilink">Iceland-Faroe Ridge</a> (about 600 meters), the <a href="Wyville-Thomson_Ridge" title="wikilink">Wyville-Thomson Ridge</a> (620 meters) and areas between <a href="Greenland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenland</a> and <a href="Denmark_Strait" title="wikilink">Denmark Strait</a> (850 meters) &lt;U+2013&gt; this is much shallower than the Norwegian Sea.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Cold deep water flows into the Atlantic through various channels: about 1.9 Sv through the Faroe Bank channel, 1.1 Sv through the Iceland-Faroe channel and 0.1 Sv via the Wyville-Thomson Ridge.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The turbulence that occurs when the deep water falls behind the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the deep Atlantic basin mixes the adjacent water layers and forms the <a href="North_Atlantic_Deep_Water" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Deep Water</a>, one of two major deep-sea currents providing the deep ocean with oxygen.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
<p>The thermohaline circulation affects the climate in the Norwegian Sea, and the regional climate can significantly deviate from average. There is also a difference of about 10 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C between the sea and the coastline. Temperatures rose between 1920 and 1960,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the frequency of storms decreased in this period. The storminess was relatively high between 1880 and 1910, decreased significantly in 1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1960, and then recovered to the original level.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast to the Greenland Sea and Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice-free year round, owing to its warm currents.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The convection between the relatively warm water and cold air in the winter plays an important role in the Arctic climate.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The 10-degree July isotherm (air temperature) runs through the northern boundary of the Norwegian Sea and is often taken as the southern boundary of the Arctic.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Norwegian Sea in winter generally has the lowest air pressure in the entire Arctic and is a region where most <a href="Icelandic_Low" title="wikilink">Icelandic Low</a> depressions form.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The water temperature in most parts of the sea is 2&lt;U+2013&gt;7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C in February and 8&lt;U+2013&gt;12 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C in August.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="plankton-and-sea-bottom-organisms">Plankton and sea bottom organisms</h3>
<p>Most of the aquatic life in the Norwegian Sea is concentrated in the upper layers.

<p><img src="Heringsschwarm.gif" title="fig:Herring" alt="Herring" /> The Norwegian coastal waters are the most important spawning ground of the <a href="Atlantic_Herring" title="wikilink">herring populations</a> of the North Atlantic, and the hatching occurs in March. The eggs float to the surface and are washed off the coast by the northward current. Whereas a small herring population remains in the fjords and along the northern Norwegian coast, the majority spends the summer in the Barents Sea, where it feeds on the rich plankton. Upon reaching puberty, herring returns to the Norwegian Sea.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The herring stock varies greatly between the years.

<p>Norway, Iceland and Denmark/Faroe Islands share the territorial waters of the Norwegian Sea, with the largest part belonging to the former country. Norway claimed <a href="territorial_waters" title="wikilink">twelve-mile limit</a> as territorial waters since 2004 and an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles since 1976. Consequently, due to the Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen, the southeast, northeast and northwest edge of the sea occur within Norway.

The ships are Dutch and the animals are bowhead whales. Beerenburg on Jan Mayen Land can be seen in the background." /> Fishing near Lofoten archipelago has been practiced for hundreds years. The coastal waters of remote Lofoten islands are one of the richest fishing areas in Europe as most of the Atlantic cod swims in the winter to the coastal waters of Lofoten to spawn. So in the 19th century, dried cod was one of Norway's main areas of exports and by far the most important industry in northern Norway. Strong sea currents, <a href="maelstrom" title="wikilink">maelstroms</a>, and especially frequent storms made fishing a dangerous occupation: several hundred men died on the &quot;Fatal Monday&quot; in March 1821, 300 of them being from a single <a href="parish" class="uri" title="wikilink">parish</a>, and about a hundred boats with their crews were lost within a short time in April 1875.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Whaling was also important for the Norwegian Sea. In the early 1600s, the Englishman <a href="Stephen_Bennet" title="wikilink">Stephen Bennet</a> started hunting <a href="walrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">walrus</a> at the <a href="Bear_Island" title="wikilink">Bear Island</a>. In May 1607 the <a href="Muscovy_Company" title="wikilink">Muscovy Company</a>, while looking for the <a href="Northwest_Passage" title="wikilink">Northwest Passage</a> and exploring the sea, discovered the large populations of walrus and whales in the Norwegian Sea and started hunting them in 1610 near <a href="Spitsbergen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spitsbergen</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Later in the 17th century, Dutch ships started hunting bowhead whales near <a href="Jan_Mayen" title="wikilink">Jan Mayen</a> island; the bowhead population between Svalbard and Jan Mayen was than about 25,000 individuals.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Britain and Netherlands were then joined by Germans, <a href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish</a> and Norway.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Between 1615 and 1820, the waters between Jan Mayen, Svalbard, Bear Island and Greenland between the Norwegian Greenland and Barents seas were the most productive whaling area in the world.

The disappearance of ships there, due to the natural disasters, induced legends of the monsters (<a href="kraken" class="uri" title="wikilink">kraken</a>) which halt and sink ships. As late as in 1845, the <a href="Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia_metropolitana" title="wikilink">Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia metropolitana</a> contained a multi-page review by <a href="Erik_Pontoppidan" title="wikilink">Erik Pontoppidan</a> (1698&lt;U+2013&gt;1764) on ship-sinking sea monsters of half a mile in size.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Many legends might be based on the work <em><a href="Historia_de_gentibus_septentrionalibus" title="wikilink">Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus</a></em> of 1539 by <a href="Olaus_Magnus" title="wikilink">Olaus Magnus</a> where he described the kraken and maelstroms of the Norwegian Sea.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The kraken also appeared in <a href="Alfred_Tennyson" title="wikilink">Alfred Tennyson</a>'s poem of the same, in Herman Melville's <em><a href="Moby_Dick" title="wikilink">Moby Dick</a></em> and in <em><a href="Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea" title="wikilink">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</a></em> by <a href="Jules_Verne" title="wikilink">Jules Verne</a>.</p>

The term maelstrom originates from the combination of Dutch words <em>malen</em> (to grind) and <em>strom</em> (stream); it was introduced into English language by Poe in his story &quot;<a href="A_Descent_into_the_Maelstr&lt;U+00F6&gt;m" title="wikilink">A Descent into the Maelstr&lt;U+00F6&gt;m</a>&quot; (1841) describing the Moskenstraumen.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The Moskenstraumen is created as a result of a combination of several factors, including the tides, position of the Lofoten and the underwater topography; unlike most others whirls, it is located in the open sea rather than in a channel or bay.

This map of 1904 shows surface and underwater currents." /> The fish-rich coastal waters of northern Norway were known for ages and were attracting skilled sailors from Iceland and Greenland. Thus most settlements in Iceland and Greenland were on the west coasts of the islands, which were also warmer due to the Atlantic currents. The first reasonably reliable map of northern Europe, the <a href="Carta_marina" title="wikilink">Carta marina</a> of 1539 represents the Norwegian Sea as coastal waters and shows nothing north of North Cape. The Norwegian Sea off the coast regions appeared on the maps in the 17th century as an important part of the then-to-find <a href="Northern_Sea_Route" title="wikilink">Northern Sea Route</a> and a rich whaling ground.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>Until the 20th century, the coasts of the Norwegian Sea were sparsely populated and therefore shipping in the sea was mostly focused on fishing, whaling and occasional coastal transportations. Since the late 19th century, the <a href="Hurtigruten" title="wikilink">Norwegian Coastal Express</a> sea line was established connecting the more densely populated south with the north of Norway by at least one trip a day. The importance of shipping in the Norwegian Sea increased with the expansion of the Russian and Soviet navies in the Barents Sea and development of international routes to the Atlantic through the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a>, <a href="Kattegat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kattegat</a>, <a href="Skagerrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skagerrak</a> and <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a>.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Sea is ice free and provides a direct route from the Atlantic to the Russian ports in the Arctic (<a href="Murmansk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Murmansk</a>, <a href="Archangel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Archangel</a>, <a href="Kandalaksha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kandalaksha</a>) which are directly linked to the central Russia. This route was extensively used for supplies during World War II &lt;U+2013&gt; from 811 US ships, 720 reached Russian ports bringing some 4 million tonnes of cargo which included about 5,000 tanks and 7,000 aircraft. The Allies lost 18 convoys and 89 merchant ships on this route.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The major operations of the German Navy against the convoys included <a href="Convoy_PQ_17" title="wikilink">PQ 17</a> in July 1942, the <a href="Battle_of_the_Barents_Sea" title="wikilink">Battle of the Barents Sea</a> in December 1942 and the <a href="Battle_of_the_North_Cape" title="wikilink">Battle of the North Cape</a> in December 1943 and were carried out around the border between Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, near the North Cape.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Navigation across the Norwegian Sea declined after the World War II and intensified only in the 1960s&lt;U+2013&gt;70s with the expansion of the <a href="Soviet_Northern_Fleet" title="wikilink">Soviet Northern Fleet</a> that was reflected in major joint naval exercises of the Soviet Northern Baltic fleets in the Norwegian Sea. The sea was the gateway for the Soviet Navy to the Atlantic Ocean and thus to the United States, and a major Soviet port of <a href="Murmansk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Murmansk</a> was just behind the border of the Norwegian and Barents Sea.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The countermeasures by the NATO countries resulted in a significant naval presence in the Norwegian Sea and intense cat-and-mouse games between Soviet and NATO aircraft, ships and especially submarines.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A relic of the Cold War in the Norwegian Sea, the Soviet nuclear submarine <a href="K-278_Komsomolets" title="wikilink">K-278 Komsomolets</a>, sank in 1989 southwest of Bear Island, at the border of the Norwegian and Barents seas, with radioactive material onboard which poses potential danger to flora and fauna.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>The Norwegian Sea is part of the <a href="Northern_Sea_Route" title="wikilink">Northern Sea Route</a> for ships from European ports to Asia. The travel distance from <a href="Rotterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rotterdam</a> to <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a> is 21,100 km via <a href="Suez_Canal" title="wikilink">Suez Canal</a> and only 14,100 km through the Norwegian Sea.
