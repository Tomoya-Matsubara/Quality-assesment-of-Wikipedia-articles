<p><strong>Toleration</strong> and <strong>tolerance</strong> are terms used within debates in areas of <a href="sociology" title="wikilink">social</a>, <a href="culture" title="wikilink">cultural</a> and <a href="religion" title="wikilink">religious</a> context, to describe attitudes and practices that prohibit <a href="discrimination" class="uri" title="wikilink">discrimination</a> against those whose practices or group memberships may be disapproved of by those in the majority. Though developed to refer to the <a href="religious_toleration" title="wikilink">religious toleration</a> of minority religious sects following the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>, these terms are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, such as the toleration of sexual practices and orientations, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.</p>
<p>The term &quot;tolerance&quot; itself, like &quot;toleration,&quot; is controversial and disliked by some due to its implication that the &quot;tolerated&quot; custom or behavior is in fact an <a href="aberration" class="uri" title="wikilink">aberration</a>. Tolerance implies both the ability to <a href="punishment" title="wikilink">punish</a> and the conscious decision not to, but makes no statement to higher principle. Supporters of the term <em>tolerance</em> claim it to be more applicable than <em>acceptance</em> and <em><a href="Wikt:respect#Usage_note" title="wikilink">respect</a></em>. Detractors of the term suggest that the term is promoted as if it were a principle &lt;U+2014&gt; one which falters when compared to more elevated concepts such as <a href="Civic_virtue" title="wikilink">civility</a> or <a href="Pluralism_(political_philosophy)" title="wikilink">Pluralism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="historical-development">Historical development</h2>
<p>As a practical matter, governments have always had to consider the question of which groups and practices to tolerate and which to persecute. The expanding <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>, for example faced the question of whether or to what extent they should permit or persecute the local beliefs and practices of groups inhabiting annexed territories. <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> or <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> practices or beliefs could be tolerated or vigorously persecuted. Likewise, during the Middle Ages, the rulers of Christian Europe or the Muslim Middle East sometimes extended toleration to minority religious groups, and sometimes did not. Jews in particular suffered under <a href="anti-semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-semitic</a> persecutions during the medieval period.</p>
<p>However the development of a body of theory on the subject of &quot;toleration&quot; begins in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in response to the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a> and the <a href="Wars_of_Religion" title="wikilink">Wars of Religion</a> and persecutions that followed the breaks with the <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a> instigated by <a href="Martin_Luther" title="wikilink">Martin Luther</a> and <a href="Huldrych_Zwingli" title="wikilink">Huldrych Zwingli</a> and others. In response to the theory of persecution that was used to justify wars of religion and the execution of persons convicted of <a href="heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">heresy</a> and <a href="witchcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">witchcraft</a>, writers such as <a href="Sebastian_Castellio" title="wikilink">Sebastian Castellio</a> and <a href="Michel_de_Montaigne" title="wikilink">Michel de Montaigne</a> questioned the morality of religious persecution, and offered arguments for toleration.</p>
<p>The most detailed and influential body of writing on the question of toleration however, was produced in Britain in the Seventeenth Century, in the period during and after the destructive <a href="English_Civil_Wars" title="wikilink">English Civil Wars</a>. <a href="John_Milton" title="wikilink">John Milton</a> and radical Parliamentarians such as <a href="Gerrard_Winstanley" title="wikilink">Gerrard Winstanley</a> argued that Christian and Jewish worship of all sorts should be protected, and it was during period that <a href="Oliver_Cromwell" title="wikilink">Oliver Cromwell</a> permitted the return of Jews to England. These early theories of toleration were limited however, and did not extend toleration to <a href="Roman_Catholics" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a> (who were perceived as disloyal to their country) or <a href="atheists" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheists</a> (who were held to lack any moral basis for action). <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a>, in his <a href="Letter_Concerning_Toleration" title="wikilink">Letter Concerning Toleration</a> and <a href="Treatises_of_Government" title="wikilink">Treatises of Government</a> proposed a more detailed and systematic theory of toleration, which including a principle of <a href="Separation_of_Church_and_State" title="wikilink">Separation of Church and State</a> that formed the basis for future constitutional democracies. The British <a href="Toleration_Act_of_1689" title="wikilink">Toleration Act of 1689</a> was the political result of seventeenth century theorists and political exigency, which despite the limited scope of the toleration it granted was nevertheless a key development in the history of toleration, which helped produce greater political stability in the British Isles.</p>
<p>The philosophers and writers of the <a href="The_Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a>, especially <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a> and <a href="Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing" title="wikilink">Lessing</a>, promoted and further developed the notion of religious tolerance, which however were not sufficient to prevent the atrocities of the <a href="Reign_of_Terror" title="wikilink">Reign of Terror</a>. Eventually <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> and others would incorporate Locke's theories of toleration into the <a href="Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Constitution of the United States of America</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recent-development">Recent development</h2>
<p>Though developed to refer to the <a href="religious_toleration" title="wikilink">religious toleration</a> of minority religious sects following the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>, the terms &quot;toleration&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot; are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, such as the toleration of sexual practices and orientations, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable. Changing applications and understandings of the term can sometimes make debate on the question difficult.</p>
<p>For example, a distinction is sometimes drawn between mere &quot;Toleration&quot; and a higher notion of &quot;Religious Liberty&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some philosophers [. . .] regard toleration and religious freedom as as quite distinct things and emphasize the differences between the two. They understand toleration to signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked upon with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful. In contrast these thinkers recognize religious liberty as as the recognition of equal freedom for all religions and denominations without any kind of discrimination among them [. . .] in the case of religious liberty, no one is rightfully possessed of the power not to tolerate or to cancel this liberty.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions of toleration therefore often divided between those who view the term as a minimal and perhaps even historical virtue (perhaps today to be replaced by a more positive and robust appreciation of <a href="pluralism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pluralism</a> or <a href="diversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">diversity</a>), and those who view it as a concept with an important continuing vitality, and who are more likely to use the term in considering contemporary issues regarding discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, or for other reasons.</p>
<p>There are also debates with regard to the historical factors that produced the principle of toleration, as well as to the proper reasons toleration should be exercised, with some arguing that the growth of <a href="skepticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">skepticism</a> was an important or necessary factor in the development of toleration, and others arguing that religious belief or an evolving notion of respect for individual persons was or is the basis on which toleration was or should be practiced.</p>
<h2 id="tolerance-and-monotheism">Tolerance and monotheism</h2>
<p>One theory of the origins of religious intolerance, propounded by <a href="Sigmund_Freud" title="wikilink">Sigmund Freud</a> in <em>Moses and Monotheism,</em> links intolerance to monotheism. More recently, Bernard Lewis and Mark Cohen have argued that the modern understanding of tolerance, involving concepts of national identity and equal citizenship for men of different religions, was not considered a value by pre-modern Muslims or Christians, due to the implications of monotheism.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The historian G.R. Elton explains that in pre-modern times, monotheists viewed such toleration as a sign of weakness or even wickedness towards God. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The usual definition of tolerance in pre-modern times as <a href="Bernard_Lewis" title="wikilink">Bernard Lewis</a> puts it was that:</p>

<p><a href="Mark_Cohen" title="wikilink">Mark Cohen</a> states that it seems that all the monotheistic religions in power throughout the history have felt it proper, if not obligatory, to persecute nonconforming religions. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Therefore, Cohen concludes, Medieval Islam and Medieval Christianity in power should have persecuted non-believers in their lands and &quot;Judaism, briefly in power during the Hasmonean period (second century BCE) should have persecuted pagan Idumeans&quot;. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Cohen continues: &quot;When all is said and done, however, the historical evidence indicates that the Jews of Islam, especially during the formative and classical centuries (up to thirteenth century), experienced much less persecution than did the Jews of Christendom. This begs a more thorough and nuanced explanation than has hitherto been given.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="tolerating-the-intolerant">Tolerating the intolerant</h2>
<p>Philosopher Karl Popper's assertion in <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em> that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance illustrates that there are limits to tolerance.</p>
<p>In particular, should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? What if by tolerating action &quot;A&quot;, society destroys itself? Tolerance of &quot;A&quot; could be used to introduce a new thought system leading to intolerance of vital institution &quot;B&quot;. It is difficult to strike a balance and different societies do not always agree on the details, indeed different groups within a single society also often fail to agree. The current suppression of <a href="Nazism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazism</a> in <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> is considered intolerant by some countries, for instance, while in Germany itself it is Nazism which is considered intolerably intolerant.</p>
<p>Philosopher <a href="John_Rawls" title="wikilink">John Rawls</a> devotes a section of his influential and controversial book <a href="A_Theory_of_Justice" title="wikilink">A Theory of Justice</a> to the problem of whether a just society should or should not tolerate the intolerant, and to the related problem of whether or not, in any society, the intolerant have any right to complain when they are not tolerated.</p>
<p>Rawls concludes that a just society must be tolerant; therefore, the intolerant must be tolerated, for otherwise, the society would then be intolerant, and so unjust. However, Rawls qualifies this by insisting that society and its social institutions have a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance. Hence, the intolerant must be tolerated but <em>only insofar as they do not endanger the tolerant society and its institutions</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, continues Rawls, while the intolerant might forfeit the right to complain when they are themselves not tolerated, other members of society have a right, perhaps even a duty, to complain on their behalf, again, as long as society itself is not endangered by these intolerant members. The <a href="ACLU" class="uri" title="wikilink">ACLU</a> is a good example of a social institution that protects the rights of the intolerant, as it frequently defends the right to free speech of such intolerant organizations as the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>.</p>
