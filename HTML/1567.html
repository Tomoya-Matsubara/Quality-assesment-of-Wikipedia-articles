He was a central figure of 20th-century British classical music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera <em><a href="Peter_Grimes" title="wikilink">Peter Grimes</a></em> (1945), the <em><a href="War_Requiem" title="wikilink">War Requiem</a></em> (1962) and the orchestral showpiece <em><a href="The_Young_Person&#39;s_Guide_to_the_Orchestra" title="wikilink">The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra</a></em> (1945).</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>, the son of a dentist, Britten showed talent from an early age. He studied at the <a href="Royal_College_of_Music" title="wikilink">Royal College of Music</a> in London and privately with the composer <a href="Frank_Bridge" title="wikilink">Frank Bridge</a>. Britten first came to public attention with the <em><a href="a_cappella" title="wikilink">a cappella</a></em> choral work <em>A Boy Was Born</em> in 1934. With the premiere of <em>Peter Grimes</em> in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for <a href="English_National_Opera" title="wikilink">Sadler's Wells</a> and <a href="The_Royal_Opera" title="wikilink">Covent Garden</a>, he wrote &quot;chamber operas&quot; for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is <em><a href="The_Turn_of_the_Screw_(opera)" title="wikilink">The Turn of the Screw</a></em> (1954). Recurring themes in the operas are the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society, and the corruption of innocence.</p>
<p>Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the <a href="tenor_voice" title="wikilink">tenor</a> <a href="Peter_Pears" title="wikilink">Peter Pears</a>; others included <a href="Janet_Baker" title="wikilink">Janet Baker</a>, <a href="Dennis_Brain" title="wikilink">Dennis Brain</a>, <a href="Julian_Bream" title="wikilink">Julian Bream</a>, <a href="Dietrich_Fischer-Dieskau" title="wikilink">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a> and <a href="Mstislav_Rostropovich" title="wikilink">Mstislav Rostropovich</a>. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as <a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Bach</a>'s <em><a href="Brandenburg_concertos" title="wikilink">Brandenburg concertos</a></em>, <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a> symphonies, and song cycles by <a href="Franz_Schubert" title="wikilink">Schubert</a> and <a href="Robert_Schumann" title="wikilink">Schumann</a>.</p>
<p>Together with Pears and the librettist and producer <a href="Eric_Crozier" title="wikilink">Eric Crozier</a>, Britten founded the annual <a href="Aldeburgh_Festival" title="wikilink">Aldeburgh Festival</a> in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of <a href="Snape_Maltings" title="wikilink">Snape Maltings</a> concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a <a href="Life_peer_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">life peerage</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Lowestoft-1903.jpg" title="fig:Lowestoft in the early 20th century" alt="Lowestoft in the early 20th century" /> Britten was born in the fishing port of <a href="Lowestoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lowestoft</a> in <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>, on the east coast of England.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was the youngest of the four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878&lt;U+2013&gt;1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Hockley (1874&lt;U+2013&gt;1937).{{#tag:ref|Britten's siblings were (Edith) Barbara (1902&lt;U+2013&gt;82), Robert Harry Marsh (&quot;Bobby&quot;, 1907&lt;U+2013&gt;87), and (Charlotte) Elizabeth (&quot;Beth&quot;, 1909&lt;U+2013&gt;89).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>|group= n}} Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at <a href="Charing_Cross_Hospital" title="wikilink">Charing Cross Hospital</a> in London he met Edith Hockley, the daughter of a junior <a href="Home_Office" title="wikilink">Home Office</a> official.

<p>The consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Britten, according to his sister Beth, &quot;got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as &quot;very ordinary middle class&quot;, but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith's father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family's social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soir&lt;U+00E9&gt;es at the house.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The illness left him with a damaged heart,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> To Edith Britten's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, or his brother, who was musically talented but interested only in <a href="ragtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ragtime</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation.

<p>When he was seven Britten was sent to a <a href="dame_school" title="wikilink">dame school</a>, run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The following year he moved on to his <a href="Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">prep school</a>, <a href="Old_Buckenham_Hall" title="wikilink">South Lodge</a>, Lowestoft, as a <a href="Day_pupil" title="wikilink">day boy</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong <a href="pacifism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pacifism</a> probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of Edith Britten's, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his <em><a href="Simple_Symphony" title="wikilink">Simple Symphony</a></em>, based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note: </p>
<p><img src="Frank-bridge-1921.jpg" title="fig:Frank Bridge, Britten&#39;s teacher" alt="Frank Bridge, Britten&#39;s teacher" /> Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in <a href="Norwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norwich</a>. At one of these, during the triennial <a href="Norfolk_and_Norwich_Festival" title="wikilink">Norfolk and Norwich Festival</a> in October 1924, he heard <a href="Frank_Bridge" title="wikilink">Frank Bridge</a>'s orchestral poem <em>The Sea</em>, conducted by the composer. Britten was, in his own phrase, &quot;knocked sideways&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her 13-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his <a href="Public_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">public school</a> the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague <a href="Harold_Samuel" title="wikilink">Harold Samuel</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing{{#tag:ref|Britten later gave an example of the detailed skill instilled in him by Bridge: &quot;I came up with a series of <a href="major_seventh" title="wikilink">major sevenths</a> on the violin. Bridge was against this, saying that the instrument didn't vibrate properly with this interval: it should be divided between two instruments&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>|group= n}} and the maxim that &quot;you should find yourself and be true to what you found.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the <em>Quatre Chansons Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;aises</em>, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. <a href="Humphrey_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Humphrey Carpenter</a> and <a href="Michael_Oliver_(writer,_broadcaster)" title="wikilink">Michael Oliver</a> judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Donald_Mitchell_(writer)" title="wikilink">Donald Mitchell</a> considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

He did not enjoy his time there.

<p>Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with <a href="Arthur_Benjamin" title="wikilink">Arthur Benjamin</a>.

<p>Britten also used his time in London to attend concerts and become better acquainted with the music of <a href="Igor_Stravinsky" title="wikilink">Stravinsky</a>, <a href="Dmitri_Shostakovich" title="wikilink">Shostakovich</a> and, most particularly, <a href="Gustav_Mahler" title="wikilink">Mahler</a>.{{#tag:ref|Britten later wrote about his youthful discovery of Mahler that he had been told that the composer was &quot;long-winded and formless ... a romantic self-indulgent, who was so infatuated with his ideas that he could never stop.

In other words, nothing for a young student!&quot; Britten judged, on the contrary, &quot;His influence on contemporary writing ... could only be beneficial. His style is free from excessive personal mannerisms, and his scores are models of how the modern virtuoso orchestra should be used, nothing being left to chance and every note sounding.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>|group= n}} He intended postgraduate study in Vienna with <a href="Alban_Berg" title="wikilink">Alban Berg</a>, <a href="Arnold_Schoenberg" title="wikilink">Arnold Schoenberg</a>'s student, but was eventually dissuaded by his parents, on the advice of the RCM staff.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The first of Britten's compositions to attract wide attention were composed while at the RCM: the Sinfonietta, Op. 1 (1932), and a set of choral variations <em>A Boy was Born</em>, written in 1933 for the <a href="BBC_Singers" title="wikilink">BBC Singers</a>, who first performed it the following year.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In this same period he wrote <em>Friday Afternoons</em>, a collection of 12 songs for the pupils of Clive House School, <a href="Prestatyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prestatyn</a>, where his brother was headmaster.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-professional-life">Early professional life</h3>
<p>In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten was invited to a job interview by the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>'s director of music <a href="Adrian_Boult" title="wikilink">Adrian Boult</a> and his assistant <a href="Edward_Clark_(conductor)" title="wikilink">Edward Clark</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Britten was not enthusiastic about the prospect of working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, <em>The King's Stamp</em>, directed by <a href="Alberto_Cavalcanti" title="wikilink">Alberto Cavalcanti</a> for the <a href="GPO_Film_Unit" title="wikilink">GPO Film Unit</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="AudenVanVechten1939.jpg" title="fig:W H Auden in 1939" alt="W H Auden in 1939" width="125" /> Britten became a member of the film unit's small group of regular contributors, another of whom was <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W H Auden</a>. Together they worked on the documentary films <em>Coal Face</em> and <em><a href="Night_Mail" title="wikilink">Night Mail</a></em> in 1935.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> They also collaborated on the song cycle <em>Our Hunting Fathers</em> (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including <em>Cabaret Songs</em>, <em><a href="On_This_Island" title="wikilink">On This Island</a></em>, <a href="Paul_Bunyan_(operetta)" title="wikilink"><em>Paul Bunyan</em></a> and <em><a href="Hymn_to_St._Cecilia" title="wikilink">Hymn to St. Cecilia</a></em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as <a href="David_Matthews_(composer)" title="wikilink">David Matthews</a> puts it, &quot;cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous&quot;; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Britten composed prolifically in this period. In the three years from 1935 to 1937 he wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Among the film music of the late 1930s Matthews singles out <em>Night Mail</em> and <em><a href="Love_from_a_Stranger_(1937_film)" title="wikilink">Love from a Stranger</a></em> (1937); among the theatre music he selects for mention, <em><a href="The_Ascent_of_F6" title="wikilink">The Ascent of F6</a></em> (1936), <em><a href="On_the_Frontier" title="wikilink">On the Frontier</a></em> (1938) and <em><a href="Johnson_Over_Jordan" title="wikilink">Johnson Over Jordan</a></em> (1939); and of the music for radio, <em>King Arthur</em> (1937) and <em>The Sword in the Stone</em> (1939).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1937 there were two events of huge importance in Britten's life: his mother died, and he met the <a href="tenor" class="uri" title="wikilink">tenor</a> <a href="Peter_Pears" title="wikilink">Peter Pears</a>. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted to his mother and was devastated at her death, it also seems to have been something of a liberation for him.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, <a href="The_Company_of_Heaven#History" title="wikilink">a setting</a> of <a href="Emily_Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Emily Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;</a>'s poem, &quot;A thousand gleaming fires&quot;, for tenor and strings.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>In April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend <a href="Christopher_Isherwood" title="wikilink">Christopher Isherwood</a> to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Their relationship ceased to be platonic, and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was.

Britten conducted the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's <a href="Symphony_No._14_(Shostakovich)" title="wikilink">Fourteenth Symphony</a> at Snape in 1970.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> he was himself the dedicatee of <em>The Prodigal Son</em>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Two other Russian musicians who were close to Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist <a href="Sviatoslav_Richter" title="wikilink">Sviatoslav Richter</a> and the cellist <a href="Mstislav_Rostropovich" title="wikilink">Mstislav Rostropovich</a>.

<p>Britten's last works include the <em>Suite on English Folk Tunes &quot;A Time There Was&quot;</em> (1974); the Third String Quartet (1975), which drew on material from <em>Death in Venice</em>; and the dramatic cantata <em><a href="Phaedra_(cantata)" title="wikilink">Phaedra</a></em> (1975), written for <a href="Janet_Baker" title="wikilink">Janet Baker</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="personal-life-and-character">Personal life and character</h2>
<p>Despite his large number of works on Christian themes, Britten has sometimes been thought of as agnostic.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Pears said that when they met in 1937 he was not sure whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the <a href="John_Robinson_(bishop_of_Woolwich)" title="wikilink">Bishop of Woolwich</a> in <em><a href="Honest_to_God" title="wikilink">Honest to God</a></em>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Politically, Britten was on the left.

<p>Physically, Britten was never robust. He walked and swam regularly and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, a few of them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="controversies">Controversies</h3>
<p><strong>Boys</strong></p>
<p>Britten was attracted to young boys &lt;U+2013&gt; what Auden called &quot;thin-as-a-board juveniles &lt;U+2013&gt; sexless and innocent&quot;.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography addresses the matter, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly <a href="John_Bridcut" title="wikilink">John Bridcut</a>'s <em><a href="Britten&#39;s_Children" title="wikilink">Britten's Children</a></em> (2006), which concentrates on this aspect of the composer. Among those to whom Britten was drawn were the young <a href="David_Hemmings" title="wikilink">David Hemmings</a> and <a href="Michael_Crawford" title="wikilink">Michael Crawford</a>, who sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Hemmings later said, &quot;In all of the time that I spent with him he never abused that trust&quot;, and Crawford wrote &quot;I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man ... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people.

<p><strong>Cause of death</strong></p>
<p>A more recent controversy was the statement in a 2013 biography of Britten by Paul Kildea that the composer's heart failure was due to undetected <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a>, which Kildea speculates was a result of Pears's promiscuity while the two were living in New York.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In response, Britten's consultant cardiologist said that, like all the hospital's similar cases, Britten was routinely screened for syphilis before the operation, with negative results.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> He described as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; Kildea's allegation that the surgeon who operated on Britten in 1973 would or even could have covered up a syphilitic condition.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Kildea continued to maintain, &quot;When all the composer's symptoms are considered there can be only one cause&quot;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> In <em>The Times</em>, <a href="Richard_Morrison_(music_critic)" title="wikilink">Richard Morrison</a> praised the rest of Kildea's book, and hoped that its reputation would not be &quot;tarnished by one sensational speculation ... some second-hand hearsay ... presenting unsubstantiated gossip as fact&quot;.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="influences">Influences</h3>
<p>Britten's early musical life was dominated by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the &quot;<a href="Three_Bs" title="wikilink">Fourth B</a>&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; after <a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Bach</a>, <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Beethoven</a> and <a href="Johannes_Brahms" title="wikilink">Brahms</a>.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: &quot;Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of <em>Fidelio</em> for my fourteenth birthday ... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations&quot;.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, &quot;to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!&quot;<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>Through his association with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> He discovered the music of <a href="Claude_Debussy" title="wikilink">Debussy</a> and <a href="Maurice_Ravel" title="wikilink">Ravel</a> which, Matthews writes, &quot;gave him a model for an orchestral sound&quot;.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Bridge also led Britten to the music of Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: &quot;The real musicians are so few &amp; far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs &amp; Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; adding, as an afterthought: &quot;Shostakovitch &lt;U+2013&gt; perhaps &lt;U+2013&gt; possibly&quot;.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the &quot;brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger&quot;; <a href="Percy_Grainger" title="wikilink">Grainger</a> became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Britten was also impressed by <a href="Frederick_Delius" title="wikilink">Delius</a>, and thought <em><a href="Brigg_Fair#Delius_orchestral_setting" title="wikilink">Brigg Fair</a></em> &quot;delicious&quot; when he heard it in 1931.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's <em><a href="The_Rite_of_Spring" title="wikilink">The Rite of Spring</a></em>, which he found &quot;bewildering and terrifying&quot;, yet at the same time &quot;incredibly marvellous and arresting&quot;. The same composer's <em><a href="Symphony_of_Psalms" title="wikilink">Symphony of Psalms</a></em>, and <em><a href="Petrushka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrushka</a></em> were lauded in similar terms.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p>Besides his growing attachments to the works of 20th century masters, Britten &lt;U+2013&gt; along with his contemporary <a href="Michael_Tippett" title="wikilink">Michael Tippett</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; was devoted to the English music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in particular the work of Purcell.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: &quot;One of my chief aims is to try to restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell&quot;.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Among the closest of Britten's kindred composer spirits &lt;U+2013&gt; even more so than Purcell &lt;U+2013&gt; was <a href="Gustav_Mahler" title="wikilink">Mahler</a>, whose <a href="Symphony_No._4_(Mahler)" title="wikilink">Fourth Symphony</a> Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler's music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: &quot;... entirely clean and transparent ... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end&quot;.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular <em><a href="Das_Lied_von_der_Erde" title="wikilink">Das Lied von der Erde</a></em>; he wrote to a friend about the concluding &quot;Abschied&quot; of <em>Das Lied</em>: &quot;It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful&quot;.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In 1938, Britten attended what was only the second British performance of <a href="Symphony_No._8_(Mahler)" title="wikilink">Mahler's Eighth Symphony</a>, the &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, with <a href="Henry_Wood" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Wood</a> and the <a href="BBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a>.

In the large-scale category are <em><a href="Peter_Grimes" title="wikilink">Peter Grimes</a></em> (1945), <em><a href="Billy_Budd_(opera)" title="wikilink">Billy Budd</a></em> (1951), <em><a href="Gloriana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloriana</a></em> (1953), <em><a href="A_Midsummer_Night&#39;s_Dream_(opera)" title="wikilink">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em> (1960) and <em>Death in Venice</em> (1973). Of the remaining operas, <em><a href="The_Rape_of_Lucretia" title="wikilink">The Rape of Lucretia</a></em> (1946), <em><a href="Albert_Herring" title="wikilink">Albert Herring</a></em> (1947), <em><a href="The_Little_Sweep" title="wikilink">The Little Sweep</a></em> (1949) and <em><a href="The_Turn_of_the_Screw_(opera)" title="wikilink">The Turn of the Screw</a></em> (1954) were written for small opera companies. <em><a href="Noye&#39;s_Fludde" title="wikilink">Noye's Fludde</a></em> (1958), <em><a href="Curlew_River" title="wikilink">Curlew River</a></em> (1964), <em><a href="The_Burning_Fiery_Furnace" title="wikilink">The Burning Fiery Furnace</a></em> (1966), and <em><a href="The_Prodigal_Son_(Britten)" title="wikilink">The Prodigal Son</a></em> (1968) were for church performance, and the secular <em>The Golden Vanity</em> was intended to be performed in schools. <em><a href="Owen_Wingrave" title="wikilink">Owen Wingrave</a></em>, written for television, was first presented live by the <a href="The_Royal_Opera" title="wikilink">Royal Opera</a> at Covent Garden in 1973, two years after its broadcast premiere.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>Music critics have frequently commented on the recurring theme in Britten's operas from <em>Peter Grimes</em> onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the 28 years between <em>Peter Grimes</em> and <em>Death in Venice</em> Britten's musical style changed, as he introduced elements of <a href="atonalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atonalism</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; though remaining essentially a tonal composer &lt;U+2013&gt; and of eastern music, particularly gamelan sounds but also eastern harmonies.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> In <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> the orchestral scoring varies to fit the nature of each set of characters: &quot;the bright, percussive sounds of harps, keyboards and percussion for the fairy world, warm strings and wind for the pairs of lovers, and lower woodwind and brass for the mechanicals&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> In <em>Death in Venice</em> Britten turns Tadzio and his family into silent dancers, &quot;accompanied by the colourful, glittering sounds of tuned percussion to emphasize their remoteness.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>As early as 1948 the music analyst <a href="Hans_Keller" title="wikilink">Hans Keller</a>, summarising Britten's impact on 20th-century opera to that date, compared his contribution to that of <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a> in the 18th century: &quot;Mozart may in some respects be regarded as a founder (a 'second founder') of opera. The same can already be said today, as far as the modern British &lt;U+2013&gt; perhaps not only British &lt;U+2013&gt; field goes, of Britten&quot;.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> In addition to his own original operas, Britten, together with Imogen Holst, extensively revised Purcell's <em><a href="Dido_and_Aeneas" title="wikilink">Dido and Aeneas</a></em> (1951) and <em><a href="The_Fairy-Queen" title="wikilink">The Fairy-Queen</a></em> (1967). These &quot;realisations&quot; brought Purcell, who was then neglected, to a wider public, but have themselves been neglected since the dominance of the trend to authentic performance practice.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> His 1948 revision of <em><a href="The_Beggar&#39;s_Opera" title="wikilink">The Beggar's Opera</a></em> amounts to a wholesale recomposition, retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="song-cycles">Song cycles</h3>
<p>Throughout his career Britten was drawn to the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, <em>Quatre chansons fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;aises</em>, setting words by <a href="Victor_Hugo" title="wikilink">Victor Hugo</a> and <a href="Paul_Verlaine" title="wikilink">Paul Verlaine</a>. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, &quot;the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic&quot;.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed <em>Our Hunting Fathers</em> (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is &quot;as exciting as <em>Les Illuminations</em>, and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.&quot;<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>

Britten's music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud's poems; Copland commented of the section &quot;Antique&quot; that he did not know how Britten dared to write the melody.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten's early years.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> By the time of Britten's next cycle, <em>Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo</em> (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews's phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as &quot;his declaration of love for Peter&quot;.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle.

<p>The <em><a href="Serenade_for_Tenor,_Horn_and_Strings" title="wikilink">Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings</a></em> (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as &quot;not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think&quot;, it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with <em>Peter Grimes</em> it established him as one of the leading composers of his day.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> Mason calls it &quot;a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method.

<p>Nicholas Maw said of Britten's vocal music: &quot;His feeling for poetry (not only English) and the inflexions of language make him, I think, the greatest musical realizer of English&quot;.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> One of the best-known works in which Britten set poetry was the <em><a href="War_Requiem" title="wikilink">War Requiem</a></em> (1962).

At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's &quot;Strange meeting&quot; mingles with the <em><a href="In_paradisum" title="wikilink">In paradisum</a></em> of the mass. Matthews describes the conclusion of the work as &quot;a great wave of benediction [which] recalls the end of the <em>Sinfonia da Requiem</em>, and its similar ebbing away into the sea that symbolises both reconciliation and death.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Other works for voices and orchestra include the <em><a href="Missa_Brevis_(Britten)" title="wikilink">Missa Brevis</a></em> and the <em><a href="Cantata_academica" title="wikilink">Cantata academica</a></em> (both 1959) on religious themes, and the late cantata <em><a href="Phaedra_(cantata)" title="wikilink">Phaedra</a></em> (1975), a story of fated love and death modelled on Handel's Italian cantatas.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>

<p>The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, &quot;It is easy, because of the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres.&quot;<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> Maw said of Britten, &quot;He is one of the 20th century's great orchestral composers ... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.&quot;<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the <em><a href="Variations_on_a_Theme_of_Frank_Bridge" title="wikilink">Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge</a></em> (1937), the <em><a href="Sinfonia_da_Requiem" title="wikilink">Sinfonia da Requiem</a></em> (1940), the <em>Four Sea Interludes</em> (1945) and <em><a href="The_Young_Person&#39;s_Guide_to_the_Orchestra" title="wikilink">The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra</a></em> (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant <a href="fugue" title="wikilink">fugal</a> finale.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> The Sinfonia moves from an opening <em>Lacrymosa</em> filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce <em><a href="Dies_Irae" title="wikilink">Dies Irae</a></em> and then to a final <em>Requiem aeternam</em>, described by the critic Herbert Glass as &quot;the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible&quot;.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: &quot;less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically.

<p>Unlike his English predecessors such as <a href="Edward_Elgar" title="wikilink">Elgar</a> and Vaughan Williams, and composers from mainland Europe whom he admired, including Mahler and Shostakovich, Britten was not a classical symphonist. His youthful <em>jeux d'esprit</em> the <em>Simple Symphony</em> (1934) is in conventional symphonic structure, observing <a href="sonata_form" title="wikilink">sonata form</a> and the traditional four-movement pattern, but of his mature works his <em>Spring Symphony</em> (1949) is more a song cycle than a true symphony,<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> and the concertante <a href="Cello_Symphony_(Britten)" title="wikilink">Cello Symphony</a> (1963) is an attempt to balance the traditional concerto and symphony.

<p>The <a href="Piano_Concerto_(Britten)" title="wikilink">Piano Concerto</a> (1938) was at first criticised for being too light-hearted and virtuoso. In 1945 Britten revised it, replacing a skittish third movement with a more sombre <a href="passacaglia" class="uri" title="wikilink">passacaglia</a> that, in Matthews's view, gives the work more depth, and makes the apparent triumph of the finale more ambivalent.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> The <a href="Violin_Concerto_(Britten)" title="wikilink">Violin Concerto</a> (1940) has virtuoso elements, but they are balanced by lyrical and elegiac passages, &quot;undoubtedly reflecting Britten's growing concern with the escalation of world hostilities.&quot;<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Neither concerto is among Britten's most popular works, but in the 21st century the Violin Concerto has been performed more frequently than before, both in the concert hall and on record.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>Britten's incidental music for theatre, film and radio, much of it unpublished, was the subject of an essay by William Mann, published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten's music to that date.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Of these pieces the music for a radio play, <em>The Rescue</em>, by <a href="Edward_Sackville-West,_5th_Baron_Sackville" title="wikilink">Edward Sackville-West</a>, is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as &quot;of such stature and individual character as to be worth a regular place alongside [Britten's] other dramatic scores.&quot;<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of <em>Billy Budd</em>,<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> while Foreman observes that Britten &quot;appears to have made passing allusions to <em>The Rescue</em> in his final opera, <em>Death in Venice</em>.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
