<p>Cho's relatives thought that he was <a href="selective_mutism" title="wikilink">mute</a> or possibly <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mentally ill</a>. According to Cho's uncle, Cho &quot;didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t say much and didn't mix with other children.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Cho's maternal great-aunt, Kim Yang-soon, described Cho as &quot;cold&quot; and a cause of family concern from as young as 8 years old. According to Kim, who met him twice,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Cho was extremely shy and &quot;just wouldn't talk at all.&quot; He was otherwise considered &quot;well-behaved,&quot; readily obeying verbal commands and cues.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister, but little news about Cho.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Cho studied at <a href="Poplar_Tree_Elementary_School" title="wikilink">Poplar Tree Elementary School</a> in <a href="Chantilly,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Chantilly</a>, an unincorporated community in <a href="Fairfax_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Fairfax County</a>.

Cho was noted for being good at mathematics and English, and teachers pointed to him as an example for other students.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Kim met Cho in the fifth grade, where Kim and Cho were among three Korean students at the school during that time.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Both Kim and Cho attended the same classes and rode the school bus together. Back then, according to Kim, nobody hated Cho and he &quot;was recognised by friends as a boy of knowledge ... a good dresser who was popular with the girls.&quot; Cho kept a distance from others because he chose to do so. Kim added that &quot;I only have good memories about him.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="behavior-in-middle-school-and-high-school">Behavior in middle school and high school</h3>
<p>Cho attended secondary schools in Fairfax County, including Stone Middle School in Centreville<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and <a href="Westfield_High_School_(Fairfax_County,_Virginia)" title="wikilink">Westfield High School</a> in Chantilly.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In middle school and high school, Cho was teased and picked on for his shyness and unusual speech patterns. Some classmates even offered dollar bills to Cho just to hear him talk.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> According to Chris Davids, a high school classmate in Cho's English class at Westfield High School, Cho looked down and refused to speak when called upon. Davids added that, after one teacher threatened to give Cho a failing grade for not participating in class, Cho began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded &quot;like he had something in his mouth.&quot; &quot;The whole class started laughing and pointing and saying, 'Go back to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>.'&quot; Another classmate, Stephanie Roberts, stated that &quot;[t]here were just some people who were really cruel to him, and they would push him down and laugh at him. He didn't speak English really well, and they would really make fun of him.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Cho was also teased as the &quot;trombone kid&quot; for his habit of walking to school alone with his trombone, other students recall crueler names and that most of the bullying was because he was so alone.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Christopher Chomchird and Carmen Blandon, former classmates of Cho, stated that they heard rumors of a &quot;hit list&quot; of other students Cho wanted to kill. Blandon stated that she saw the &quot;list&quot; as a joke at the time.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> While several students recalled instances of Cho being teased and mocked at Westfield, most left him alone and were not aware of his anger.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> It is unknown if or how much his experience at Westfield contributed to his mental breakdown. Cho graduated from Westfield High School in 2003.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>To address his problems, Cho's parents took him to church. Cho was bullied in his <a href="Youth_ministry" title="wikilink">youth group</a>, especially by &quot;the rich kids.&quot; According to a pastor at Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was an intelligent student who understood the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, but he was concerned about Cho&lt;U+2019&gt;s difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to <a href="NBC_News" title="wikilink">NBC News</a>, he never saw him complete a sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was a little autistic and he asked her to take him to a hospital, but she declined.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="demeanor-at-virginia-tech">Demeanor at Virginia Tech</h2>
<p>During 2003, Cho's freshman year at <a href="Virginia_Tech" title="wikilink">Virginia Tech</a>, he enrolled as an <a href="undergraduate" class="uri" title="wikilink">undergraduate</a> <a href="academic_major" title="wikilink">major</a> in <a href="business" class="uri" title="wikilink">business</a> <a href="information_technology" title="wikilink">information technology</a>, a program that included &quot;a combination of <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a> and management coursework offered by the Pamplin College of Business.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The undergraduate program for business information technology, considered one of the most challenging disciplines at Virginia Tech, was listed as No. 6 on the &quot;list of majors with the highest median starting salary after graduation.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> By his senior year, Cho was an undergraduate majoring in <a href="English_studies" title="wikilink">English</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Virginia Tech declined to divulge details about Cho's academic record and why he changed his major, citing privacy laws.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time of the attacks, Cho lived with five roommates in Suite 2121, a three-room dormitory at Harper Hall<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> that is located just west of West Ambler Johnston Hall on the Virginia Tech campus.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relationship-with-professors">Relationship with professors</h3>
<p>Professor and acclaimed <a href="Poet" title="wikilink">poet</a> <a href="Nikki_Giovanni" title="wikilink">Nikki Giovanni</a>, who taught Cho in a poetry class, stated that she had him removed from her class because she found his behavior menacing. She recalls being bothered by a &quot;mean streak&quot; and described Cho's writing as &quot;intimidating.&quot; When informed of the massacre, she remarked, &quot;I knew when it happened that that's probably who it was,&quot; and &quot;I would have been shocked if it wasn't.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Giovanni insisted that Cho be removed from her class in 2005, about six weeks after the semester had started in September. Cho had intimidated female students by photographing their legs under their desks and by writing obscene, violent poetry.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Giovanni said, &quot;I was willing to resign before I would continue with him.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Giovanni wrote a letter to then-department head <a href="Lucinda_Roy" title="wikilink">Lucinda Roy</a>, who removed Cho from the class. Roy alerted student affairs, the dean's office, and the campus police, but each said there was nothing they could do if Cho had made no overt threats against himself or others.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Roy described Cho as &quot;an intelligent man,&quot; and she stated that Cho seemed to be an awkward and very lonely and an insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors. She described Cho's behavior as at times &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;obnoxious.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Roy said that she tried several different ways to help him.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Roy would not comment at length on Cho&lt;U+2019&gt;s writings, saying only that in general the writings &quot;seemed very angry.&quot; She added that Cho whispered his response after taking 20 seconds to answer questions, and he also took <a href="camera_phone" title="wikilink">cell phone pictures</a> of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. Roy said that she was concerned for her safety when she met with him. She told her assistant that, if she uttered the name of a dead professor (which served as a <a href="duress_code" title="wikilink">duress code</a>), the assistant was to call security.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> After Roy notified the legal authorities about Cho's behavior, Roy urged Cho to seek <a href="counseling" class="uri" title="wikilink">counseling</a>, but he never followed through with the request to her knowledge.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>When Virginia Tech creative writing professor <a href="Lisa_Norris" title="wikilink">Lisa Norris</a>, who taught Cho in both Advanced Fiction Writing and Contemporary Fiction, inquired about Cho from the school's associate dean for Liberal Arts and Human Sciences Mary Ann Lewis, she was not told that Cho was suffering from mental health issues nor was she told about the prior police reports about the stalking incidents. Norris noted that, &quot;[m]y guess is that either the information was not accessible to her or it was privileged and could not be released to me.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Lewis told Norris to recommend that Cho seek counseling at the on-campus Cook Counseling Center, which she had already done.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relationship-with-students">Relationship with students</h3>
<p>Fellow students described Cho as a &quot;quiet&quot; person who &quot;would not respond if someone greeted him.&quot; Student Julie Poole recalled the first day of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one. When it was Cho's turn to introduce himself, he did not speak. According to Poole, the professor looked at the sign-in sheet and found that, whereas everyone else wrote out their names, Cho wrote only a question mark. Poole added that &quot;[w]e just really knew him as the question mark kid.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Karan Grewal, one of the roommates who shared a room with Cho at Harper Hall, reported that Cho &quot;would sit in a wood rocker by the window [in his room at the dormitory] and stare at the lawn below.&quot; According to Grewal, &quot;Cho appeared to never to go to class or read a book&quot; during his (Cho's) senior year at Virginia Tech,&quot; adding that Cho just typed on his laptop, went to the dining hall and clipped his hair in the bathroom, cleaning up the hair afterwards. Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles in the parking lot of the dormitory.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Andy Koch and John Eide, who once shared a room with Cho at Cochrane Hall during 2005 and 2006,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> stated that Cho demonstrated other repetitive behaviors, such as listening repeatedly to &quot;<a href="Shine_(Collective_Soul_song)" title="wikilink">Shine</a>&quot; by the alternative rock band <a href="Collective_Soul" title="wikilink">Collective Soul</a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and writing the song's lyrics &quot;Teach me how to speak; Teach me how to share; Teach me where to go&quot; on the wall in his dormitory room.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Koch described two unusual incidents, including one where Cho stood in the doorway of his room late at night taking photographs of him (Koch) and a second incident where Cho repeatedly placed harassing cell phone calls to Koch as &quot;Cho's brother, '<a href="Question_mark" title="wikilink">Question Mark</a>,'&quot; a name Cho also used when introducing himself to girls with whom he was allegedly obsessed. Koch and Eide searched Cho's belongings and found a pocket knife, but they did not find any items that they deemed seriously threatening to them.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>During fall 2005, Cho told Koch and Eide that he had an imaginary girlfriend by the name of &quot;Jelly,&quot; a <a href="supermodel" class="uri" title="wikilink">supermodel</a> who lived in outer space and who called Cho by the name &quot;Spanky&quot; and traveled by spaceship.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Koch also described a telephone call that he received from Cho during the <a href="Thanksgiving" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a> holiday break from school. During that call, Koch said that Cho claimed to be &quot;vacationing with <a href="Vladimir_Putin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Putin</a>,&quot; with Cho adding &quot;Yeah, we're in <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>.&quot; In response to Cho's claim, Koch told him &quot;I'm pretty sure that's not possible Seung.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Because of Cho's troubling behavior, Koch and Eide, who had earlier tried to befriend Cho, gradually stopped talking to him and told their friends, especially female classmates, not to visit their room.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Andy Koch and John Eide also stated that Cho was involved in at least three stalking incidents, two of which resulted in verbal warnings by the Virginia Tech campus police.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The first stalking incident occurred on <a href="November_27" title="wikilink">November 27</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> After the incident, according to Koch, Cho claimed to have sent an <a href="instant_message" title="wikilink">instant message</a> online to the female student by <a href="AOL_Instant_Messenger" title="wikilink">AIM</a> and found out where she lived on the campus. Koch also stated that Cho then visited her room to see if she was &quot;cool,&quot; adding that Cho remarked that he only found &quot;promiscuity&quot; in her eyes.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Eide added that, when Cho visited the female student, Cho said, &quot;Hi, I'm Question Mark&quot; to her, &quot;which really freaked her out.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The female student called the campus police, complaining that Cho had sent her annoying messages and made an unannounced visit to her room.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Two uniformed members of the campus police visited Cho&lt;U+2019&gt;s room at the dormitory later that evening and verbally warned him not to contact the female student again. Cho made no further contact with that female student.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The final stalking incident occurred on <a href="December_13" title="wikilink">December 13</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Cho frightened a female friend of Koch by writing on her door board a line from <a href="Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> <a href="Romeo_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo and Juliet</a>, Act 2, scene II, in which <a href="Romeo_(character)" title="wikilink">Romeo</a> laments to <a href="Juliet_Capulet" title="wikilink">Juliet</a>:</p>

<p>The young woman contacted the campus police, and the campus police again verbally warned Cho against further unwanted contacts.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> After that verbal warning, Cho made no further contact with the second female student. At a later time, Cho sent a <a href="Mobile_phone_text_messaging" title="wikilink">text message</a> to Koch with the words, &quot;I might as well kill myself now.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Worried that Cho was suicidal, Koch contacted his father for advice, and both of them contacted campus authorities.

<p>On <a href="December_13" title="wikilink">December 13</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Cho was found &quot;mentally ill and in need of hospitalization&quot; by New River Valley Community Services Board.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The physician who examined Cho noted that he had a <a href="flat_affect" title="wikilink">flat affect</a> and <a href="Depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depressed mood</a>, even though Cho &quot;denied suicidal thoughts and did not acknowledge symptoms of a thought disorder.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Based on this mental health examination and because Cho was suspected of being &quot;an imminent danger to [him]self or others,&quot; Cho was detained temporarily at Carilion St. Albans Behavioral Health Center in <a href="Christiansburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Christiansburg, Virginia</a>, pending a commitment hearing before the <a href="Montgomery_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Montgomery County, Virginia</a> <a href="General_District_Court" title="wikilink">district court</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Virginia Special Justice Paul Barnett certified in an order that Cho &quot;[presented] an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness,&quot; but instead recommended treatment for Cho as an outpatient. On <a href="December_14" title="wikilink">December 14</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Cho was released from the mental health facility after Judge Barnett ordered Cho to undergo mental health treatment on an outpatient basis,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> with a directive for the &quot;court-ordered [out-patient] to follow all recommended treatments.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Since Cho underwent only a minimal psychiatric assessment,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> the true diagnosis for Cho's mental health status remains unknown.</p>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<h4 id="crime-investigation">Crime investigation</h4>
<p>Through <a href="ballistics" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballistics</a> examination, law enforcement investigators determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at Norris Hall on the Virginia Tech campus.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Police investigators found that Cho fired 170 shots during the killing spree, with evidence technicians finding at least 17 spent ammunition magazines at the scene.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> During the investigation, federal law enforcement investigators found that the serial numbers were illegally filed off both the Walther P22 and the Glock 19 handguns used by Cho during the rampage.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Investigators also learned that Cho practiced shooting during mid-March at a firing range in Roanoke, about 40 miles from the Virginia Tech campus.<ref name=firstgun> &quot;Investigators also say Cho practiced shooting at a firing range in Roanoke, about 40 miles from the campus, in mid-March.&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> According to former FBI agent Brad Garrett, &quot;This was no spur-of-the-moment crime.

<h4 id="review-of-chos-medical-records">Review of Cho's medical records</h4>
<p>During the investigation, the matter of Cho's court-ordered mental health treatment was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that Cho never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services Board exercised oversight of Cho's case to determine his compliance with the order for outpatient treatment. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services Board maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for Cho's mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once Cho was discharged from its care after the court order.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that the court did not notify his office to report that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, &quot;When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency ... The one responsible for ensuring that the mentally ill person receives help in these sort of cases ... is the mentally ill person.&quot;<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result, Cho escaped compliance with the court order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to &quot;recommend a specific course of treatment and programs&quot; for mental health patients and &quot;monitor the person's compliance.&quot;<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> As for the court, Virgina law also mandated that, if a person fails to comply with a court order to seek mental health treatment as an outpatient, that person can be brought back before the court &quot;and if found still in crisis, can be committed to a psychiatric institution for up to 180 days.&quot; Cho was never summoned to court to explain why he had not complied with the <a href="December_14" title="wikilink">December 14</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="appointment-of-investigative-panel">Appointment of investigative panel</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of the killing spree, Virginia Governor <a href="Timothy_Kaine" title="wikilink">Timothy Kaine</a> appointed a panel to investigate the campus shootings, with plans for the panel to submit a report of its findings in approximately two to three months. Governor Kaine also invited former Homeland Security Secretary <a href="Tom_Ridge" title="wikilink">Tom Ridge</a> to join the panel to &quot;review Cho&lt;U+2019&gt;s mental health history and how police responded to the tragedy.&quot;<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> To help investigate and analyze the emergency response surrounding the Virginia Tech shootings, Governor Kaine hired the same company that investigated the Columbine massacre.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures were especially upsetting to those persons affected by the shootings. Peter Read, the father of Mary Read, one of the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="plays">Plays</h3>
<p>In 2006, Cho wrote a short, profanity-laden one-act play entitled &quot;<strong>Richard McBeef</strong>&quot; in connection with a class assignment. The play focused on John, a 13-year-old boy whose father reportedly died in a boating accident, and Richard McBeef, John's stepfather and ex-football player. When Richard touches John during an attempt at a father-to-son talk, the boy abruptly claims that his stepfather is <a href="child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">molesting</a> him. John then accuses his stepfather Richard of murdering his father and repeatedly says that he will kill Richard. John, Richard and Sue (John's mother) are embroiled suddenly in a major argument. Richard retreats to his car to escape the conflict, but John, despite claiming repeatedly that Richard was abusing him, joins his stepfather in the car and harasses him. The play ends with John trying to shove a banana-flavored cereal bar into his stepfather's throat and Richard, hitherto a passive character, reacting &quot;out of sheer desecrated hurt and anger&quot; by &quot;swinging a deadly blow&quot; at the boy.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>In a second play, &quot;<strong>Mr. Brownstone</strong>,&quot; written by Cho for another class assignment, three 17-year-olds (John, Jane and Joe) sit in a <a href="casino" class="uri" title="wikilink">casino</a> while discussing their deep hatred for Mr. Brownstone, their 45-year-old mathematics teacher. The three characters claim that Mr. Brownstone mistreats them (using the phrase &quot;ass-rape&quot;). John wins a multi-million-dollar jackpot from one of the slot machines and Mr. Brownstone, amid volleys of profanity, reports to casino officials that the three characters were underage and had picked up the winning ticket. Mr. Brownstone tells the casino officials that he had won the jackpot and that the minors took it from him.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> &quot;<a href="Mr._Brownstone" title="wikilink">Mr. Brownstone</a>&quot; was also the name of a <a href="Guns_N&#39;_Roses" title="wikilink">Guns N' Roses</a> song about <a href="heroin" class="uri" title="wikilink">heroin</a>,<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> and one page from Cho's play consisted of lyrics from the song.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reactions-to-writings">Reactions to writings</h3>
<p><a href="Edward_Falco" title="wikilink">Edward Falco</a>, a playwriting professor at Virginia Tech, has acknowledged that Cho wrote both plays in his class. The plays are less than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his difficulty communicating orally. Falco said of the plays, &quot;They're not good writing, but at least they are a form of communication.&quot;<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as &quot;very adolescent&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;, with attempts at &quot;<a href="Slapstick" title="wikilink">slapstick comedy</a>&quot; and &quot;elements of violence.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Classmates believed &quot;the plays, were really morbid and grotesque.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, &quot;[w]hen we read Cho's plays, it was like something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read &quot;Richard McBeef,&quot; he turned to his roommate and said &quot;[t]his is the kind of guy who is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was &quot;the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Novelist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Novelist</a> <a href="Stephen_King" title="wikilink">Stephen King</a> examined Cho's plays and wrote an essay for <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>. The essay read, in part:</p>

<p>According to CBS News, &quot;Cho Seung-Hui's violent writing [and] loner status fit the Secret Service shooter profile,&quot;<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> referring to a 2002 <a href="U.S._Secret_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Secret Service</a> study that was conducted after the <a href="Columbine_massacre" title="wikilink">Columbine massacre</a>, with violent writing cited as one of the most typical behavioral attributes of school shooters. The U.S. Secret Service concluded the study by saying that &quot;[t]he largest group of [school shooters] exhibited an interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays or journal entries,&quot; while other school shooters showed an interest in violent video games, violent movies and violent books.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
