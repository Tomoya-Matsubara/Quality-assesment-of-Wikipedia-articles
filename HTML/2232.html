<p><strong>3rd Battalion 3rd Marines</strong> (3/3) is an <a href="infantry" class="uri" title="wikilink">infantry</a> <a href="battalion" class="uri" title="wikilink">battalion</a> in the <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">United States Marine Corps</a>, based out of <a href="K&lt;U+0101&gt;ne&#39;ohe,_Hawai&#39;i" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+0101&gt;ne'ohe, Hawai'i</a>, and consisting of approximately 800 Marines and <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">Sailors</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Known as &quot;America's Battalion&quot;, the unit falls under the <a href="U.S._3rd_Marine_Regiment" title="wikilink">3rd Marine Regiment</a> of the <a href="3rd_Marine_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">3rd Marine Division</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The battalion was originally at <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Lejeune" title="wikilink">Camp Lejeune, North Carolina</a> in 1942 and saw action on both <a href="Bougainville_campaign" title="wikilink">Bougainville</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Guam" title="wikilink">Guam</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Following the war, it was disbanded until 1951, when it was reformed in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. The battalion was alerted for possible deployment during the 1956 <a href="Suez_War" title="wikilink">Suez War</a> and the 1958 intervention in <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>. In 1965, the Marines of 3rd Battalion were deployed to <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a> and participated in <a href="Operation_Starlite" title="wikilink">Operation Starlite</a>, the first major Marine engagement of that conflict. The battalion continued to see major action through the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> and was rotated back to the United States in 1969. Around the end of the Vietnam War, 3rd Battalion was deactivated for a second time in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1975, 3rd Battalion was reformed for the third (and last) time at <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Base Hawaii</a>. During this time, the battalion conducted numerous deployments in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1983, 3rd Battalion deployed off the coast of Lebanon for several weeks during a particularly tense period in the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">civil war</a>. It deployed again in 1990 as part of <a href="Operation_Desert_Storm" title="wikilink">Operation Desert Shield</a> and saw action at the <a href="Battle_of_Khafji" title="wikilink">Battle of Khafji</a> and again during the liberation of <a href="Kuwait" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuwait</a>. In 2004, the battalion deployed overseas again in support of <a href="Operation_Enduring_Freedom" title="wikilink">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a> and in 2006 to <a href="Haditha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haditha</a> in <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Marines from 3rd Battalion have distinguished themselves in battle and in Marine Corps service â€” among 3/3 Marines are a <a href="Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, four <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a> recipients, and over twenty <a href="Navy_Cross" title="wikilink">Navy Cross</a> winners. The battalion itself has been awarded two <a href="Presidential_Unit_Citation" title="wikilink">Presidential Unit Citations</a> for &quot;gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions&quot; and four <a href="Navy_Unit_Commendation" title="wikilink">Navy Unit Commendations</a> for &quot;outstanding service.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>Like many infantry battalions in the Marine Corps, 3/3 consists of five companies: three <a href="Company_%28military_unit%29#United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">rifle companies</a>, a <a href="Headquarters_and_Headquarters_Company" title="wikilink">Headquarters and Services</a> (H&amp;S) company, and a weapons company. The three rifle companies have traditionally been I Company, K Company, and L Company. Because the Marine Corps uses the <a href="NATO_phonetic_alphabet" title="wikilink">NATO phonetic alphabet</a>, these companies are commonly known as India, Kilo, and Lima.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Prior to 1956, under the <a href="Joint_Army/Navy_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="wikilink">Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet</a>, they were known as Item, King, and Love. A fourth rifle company, M (&quot;Mike&quot;) Company was attached to the battalion during the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>. The H&amp;S company consists of the <a href="Staff_Officer#United_States_Army_and_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">battalion staff</a>, and <a href="Weapons_company#US_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Weapons Company</a> provides fire support coordination, medium mortars, anti-armor weapons, and heavy machine gun support for the rifle companies.</p>

<p>3rd Battalion 3rd Marines was activated on <a href="1942-06-01" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942-06-01</a> at <a href="Marine_Corps_Air_Station_New_River" title="wikilink">New River, North Carolina</a> as the 5th Training Battalion, Division Special Troops, 1st Marine Division, <a href="Fleet_Marine_Force" title="wikilink">Fleet Marine Force</a>. On <a href="1942-06-16" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942-06-16</a>, they were redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, Fleet Marine Force. In August to September 1942, 3/3 deployed to <a href="American_Samoa" title="wikilink">Tutuila, American Samoa</a> and was reassigned to the <a href="2nd_Marine_Brigade" title="wikilink">2nd Marine Brigade</a>. In 1943, they were reassigned to the Fleet Marine Force. In May 1943, they redeployed to <a href="Auckland,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Auckland, New Zealand</a> and in June, were reassigned to the <a href="3rd_Marine_Division" title="wikilink">3rd Marine Division</a>. In July to August 1943, they redeployed to <a href="Guadalcanal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal</a> to begin training in preparation for the <a href="Bougainville_campaign" title="wikilink">invasion of Bougainville</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="1943-11-01" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943-11-01</a>, 3rd Battalion landed at <a href="Landings_at_Cape_Torokina" title="wikilink">Cape Torokina</a> with the rest of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While resistance was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended all the way to the water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> For the next three weeks, 3/3 slowly advanced down the Numa Numa Trail until it was ordered to dig in near Piva Forks on November 17. From <a href="1943-11-18" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943-11-18</a> to <a href="1943-11-24" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943-11-24</a>, it took part in the destruction of the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment at the <a href="Battle_of_Piva_Forks" title="wikilink">Battle of Piva Forks</a>, which earned the Marines from 3/3 four <a href="Navy_Cross" title="wikilink">Navy Crosses</a>. Two days later, 3rd Battalion was moved over to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In December, the 3rd Marine Division was relieved by the <a href="Americal_Division" title="wikilink">Americal Division</a> and 3/3 left Bougainville for Guadalcanal on Christmas Day, 1943.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> They left behind 36 of their comrades, including Corporal John Logan Jr. and Captain Robert Turnbull (Lima Company), who both won Navy Crosses during the <a href="Battle_of_Piva_Forks" title="wikilink">Battle of Piva Forks</a>. 165 other Marines from 3rd Battalion became casualties during the campaign.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> From January to May 1944, 3/3 conducted numerous training exercises on Guadalcanal in preparation for the invasion of <a href="Kavieng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kavieng</a> in April (which was cancelled) and the <a href="Marianas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marianas</a> in June. While 3rd Marines was designated as the floating reserve for the initial invasion of <a href="Saipan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saipan</a>, it was deployed the following month to the invasion of <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>.</p>

Their mission was to take Chonito Cliff and <a href="Adelup_Point" title="wikilink">Adelup Point</a>, which marked the left flank of the division.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Supported by <a href="half-tracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">half-tracks</a> and armor from the <a href="3rd_Tank_Battalion" title="wikilink">3rd Tank Battalion</a>, 3rd Battalion fought a bloody three hour battle up the side of Chonito Cliff and became the only unit in 3rd Marines to accomplish its objectives by the end of W-Day.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> During the first night, a mortarman with Kilo Company, Private First Class <a href="Luther_Skaggs,_Jr." title="wikilink">Luther Skaggs, Jr.</a>, was critically wounded in the leg by a Japanese grenade. After applying a <a href="tourniquet" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourniquet</a>, Skaggs continued to fight for another eight hours before moving unassisted to the rear where most of his leg was amputated. For this he became the first Marine from 3rd Battalion to be awarded the <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Two other Marines from 3/3, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Ralph_Houser" title="wikilink">Ralph Houser</a>, won the Navy Cross that day.</p>
<p>After securing Adelup Point, 3rd Battalion provided flank security for the rest of 3rd Marines during the Battle for Bundschu Ridge, the counterattack on the 25th which broke the back of Japanese resistance, and the assault on Fonte Plateau. During these actions Lieutenant Colonel Houser was seriously wounded and the <a href="Executive_Officer" title="wikilink">Executive Officer</a>, Major Royal R. Bastian, Jr., took command.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On <a href="1944-07-31" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944-07-31</a>, 3rd Battalion proceeded east on the Mt. Tenjo road towards the island capital of Agana, which it liberated the same day after token resistance. For the remaining ten days of the campaign, the battalion marched northeast up the coast, encountering occasional enemy resistance, until the island was declared secure on <a href="1944-08-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944-08-10</a>. Casualties for the 3rd Battalion were twice as great as on Bougainville, with 300 wounded and 97 killed.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

From November until February 1945, they took part in a training regimen so serious that a fellow battalion later reported at least 20% of its members were incapacitated due to foot and heat injuries.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> During the <a href="Battle_of_Iwo_Jima" title="wikilink">Battle of Iwo Jima</a>, 3rd Battalion, as part of 3rd Marines, was kept offshore as the Expeditionary Troops reserve. However, despite numerous requests from other Marine officers, the 3rd Marines spent its time at Iwo Jima sitting in its transport ships. On <a href="1945-03-05" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945-03-05</a>, the 3rd Marines were ordered to return to Guam.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Back on Guam, 3rd Battalion began training for a landing on <a href="Miyako_Jima" title="wikilink">Miyako Jima</a>, an island just south of <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Those orders were eventually cancelled, but the battalion still saw minor combat in 1945, participating in two operations on Guam designed to capture Japanese soldiers still holding out in the hills. These sweeps took place in April and December 1945.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> 3/3 also began preparing for <a href="Operation_Downfall" title="wikilink">Operation Olympic</a>, where as part of V Amphibious Corps, it would have landed at <a href="Kushikino,_Kagoshima" title="wikilink">Kushikino, Kagoshima</a> on <a href="Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</a>.

In May, India Company participated in the ground portion of the <a href="Operation_Buster-Jangle" title="wikilink">Operation Buster-Jangle</a> atomic bomb tests in Nevada. In August, part of the Battalion took part in an amphibious landing on <a href="Lake_Washington" title="wikilink">Lake Washington</a> as part of <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>'s &quot;<a href="Seafair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seafair</a>.&quot; Then in December, 3rd Battalion took part in one of the first exercises at <a href="Marine_Corps_Air_Ground_Combat_Center_Twentynine_Palms" title="wikilink">Twentynine Palms</a>, California. The entire 3rd Marine Division, including 3/3, was transported more than 280 miles by truck between Pendleton and Twenty-nine Palms. During the exercise, Third Battalion made a night airlift using over sixty helicopters.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 1953, the unit deployed to the <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station</a> on <a href="Oahu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oahu</a> for six months of training, after which 3/3 returned to Pendleton.

<p>In January 1965, the <a href="2nd_Battalion,_1st_Marines" title="wikilink">2nd Battalion, 1st Marines</a> at <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Pendleton" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> deployed for a tour on <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>, <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> where they were redesignated the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. At the time the Marines of 3rd Battalion expected a typical 13-month deployment followed by a quick return to the states. However 3/3 found itself caught up in the initial deployment of Marine units to <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>, and landed on May 12 along the coast south of <a href="Danang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danang</a> at an airfield called <a href="Chu_Lai" title="wikilink">Chu Lai</a>.</p>
<p>The battalion's first major operation in the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> was <a href="Operation_Starlite" title="wikilink">Operation Starlite</a>, which was also the first major American action in the war. Starlite was an attempt by three Marine battalions, including 3/3, to clear the area just south of Chu Lai of the 1st <a href="Viet_Cong" title="wikilink">VC</a> Regiment. The fighting began on <a href="1965-08-18" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965-08-18</a> when Third Battalion conducted an amphibious landing just east of the VC positions. At first the attack was slowed by effective VC delaying tactics. However, 3rd Battalion eventually advanced to the outskirts of the village of An Cuong 2. While attempting to clear the village, India Company came under intense fire from VC defending the village. When one squad under Corporal <a href="Robert_E._O&#39;Malley" title="wikilink">Robert E. O'Malley</a> was ambushed, O'Malley jumped into a VC trench and personally killed eight Viet Cong. Wounded three times, O'Malley refused to be evacuated until all his men were safe and was later awarded the <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a>. The rest of India Company managed to route the VC in the village. However, during the fighting Captain Bruce Webb was killed when a supposedly-dead VC threw a grenade into the India Company command group. India then had to fight its way back to the rest of the battalion through other Viet Cong units still operating in the area.</p>
<p>Around 1200, an H&amp;S supply convoy bound for India Company was ambushed and pinned down. A force sent to relieve them was also pinned down. During the afternoon <a href="3rd_Battalion_7th_Marines" title="wikilink">3rd Battalion 7th Marines</a> was airlifted ashore to help India Company and managed to stabilize this situation for the rest of the day. During the night, the Viet Cong retreated, resulting in a tactical American victory. The United States lost 52 Marines in the operation, 15 of which came from 3rd Battalion. Three <a href="Navy_Crosses" title="wikilink">Navy Crosses</a> were awarded to 3/3 Marines, including Captain Webb (posthumously), the battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Muir, and Sergeant James Mulloy.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

However, during this period the battalion continued to conduct regular sweeps and low-level (i.e. small unit) combat operations against the enemy. Among the casualties suffered during this period was Lieutenant Colonel Joe Muir, who was killed when he stepped on an <a href="Improvised_explosive_device" title="wikilink">IED</a>. In October 1966, 3rd Battalion was deployed to combat the threat from the <a href="North_Vietnamese_Army" title="wikilink">North Vietnamese Army</a> in the <a href="Quang_Tri" title="wikilink">Quang Tri</a> province.

<p>As one of the first Marine units in country, 3/3 found itself defending a key position at Cement Ridge, about 90 kilometers away from the Kuwaiti border. With orders to hold against any Iraqi attack, 3rd battalion spent most of the months of August and September digging defensive positions.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In October, 3/3 and <a href="2/3" class="uri" title="wikilink">2/3</a> were designated &quot;Task Force Taro&quot; and moved to the extreme right flank of the Marine sector, bordering the Saudi Arabian King Abdul Aziz Brigade. Because of their close proximity, Taro was ordered by Major General James M. Myatt (Commanding General, <a href="1st_Marine_Division" title="wikilink">1st Marine Division</a>) to begin cross-training with the Saudi forces. This cross-training continued through January, when 3/3 was moved forward to defend Al Mish'ab along the Saudi coast and became the northernmost Marine combat force in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><a href="Operation_Desert_Storm" title="wikilink">Operation Desert Storm</a> began on <a href="1991-01-17" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-01-17</a>, but for the first two weeks 3/3 only conducted sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> That all changed on <a href="1991-01-29" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-01-29</a>, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of <a href="Battle_of_Khafji" title="wikilink">Khafji</a>, less than 15 kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack, Major Craig Huddleston, the Executive Officer, along with the Battalion <a href="Sergeant_Major" title="wikilink">Sergeant Major</a> and several other <a href="non-commissioned_officers" title="wikilink">non-commissioned officers</a>, drove into the town on a rescue mission, looking for two Army soldiers who had accidentally driven right into the Iraqi positions and been captured. Although they were unable to find the soldiers, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did blunder into an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before making their own escape.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> While Saudi and <a href="Qatar" title="wikilink">Qatari</a> units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and <a href="Forward_air_controller" title="wikilink">forward air controllers</a> from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>From <a href="1991-02-19" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-02-19</a> to <a href="1991-02-21" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-02-21</a>, 3/3 moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3/3 was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security for the rest of the 1st Division to make its assault into Kuwait. As TF Taro's commander, Brigadier General John H. Admire, recalled in his history <em>The 3d Marines in Desert Storm</em>: &quot;We were encouraged by MajGen Myatt's confidence in assigning us such a critical task with minimum notice and accepted our supporting attack role with the understanding that we would have no armor, no assault amphibious vehicles, no major mechanical or explosive breaching assets. We would simply infiltrate at night on foot, with bayonets and rifles as our principal weapons.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> An NCO with 3rd Marines, Corporal Eroshevich, said the reaction among the enlisted Marines was less optimistic: &quot;We all looked at each other and said, `Well, it was nice knowing you...'&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Other Marines from 3rd Battalion wondered if they'd been given the mission because several days earlier they had shot at the 1st Marine Division commander while he was conducting forward reconnaissance.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> On the night of <a href="1991-02-22" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-02-22</a>, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi <a href="Land_mine" title="wikilink">minefields</a>, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3/3 encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from <a href="friendly_fire" title="wikilink">friendly fire</a>. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners, and arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around <a href="1991-02-27" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991-02-27</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no casualties.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

The rest of the battalion arrived throughout November. While serving in Afghanistan, 3/3 conducted Operation Spurs in February 2005, where they were inserted into the Korangal Valley and conducted both counterinsurgency and humanitarian operations. In March 3/3 launched a similar sweep called Operation Mavericks. On <a href="2004-05-08" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004-05-08</a>, the battalion suffered its only fatalities for the deployment when <a href="Lance_Corporal" title="wikilink">Lance Corporal</a> Nicholas Kirven and <a href="Corporal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corporal</a> Richard Schoener were killed during a three-hour firefight in <a href="Alisang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alisang</a> which also resulted in twenty-three <a href="Taliban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taliban</a> killed.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> During the fighting, Lieutenant <a href="Stephen_Boada" title="wikilink">Stephen Boada</a> won the <a href="Silver_Star" title="wikilink">Silver Star</a> for calmly directing bombing runs on the Taliban positions, despite being wounded several times. 3rd Battalion returned on <a href="2005-06-21" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005-06-21</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="americas-battalion">&quot;America's Battalion&quot;</h2>

With nothing else on the envelope, the <a href="United_States_Postal_Service" title="wikilink">United States Postal Service</a> still managed to deliver the letter properly. Krulak commented that &quot;if the <a href="United_States_Postal_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Postal Service</a> recognized 3/3 as 'America's Battalion,' then they certainly must be. So from then on he considered it 'official'.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> 3rd Battalion is one of two battalions to have the nickname &quot;America's Battalion&quot;, the other being <a href="2nd_Battalion_8th_Marines" title="wikilink">2nd Battalion 8th Marines</a> based out of <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Lejeune" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune</a>.</p>
