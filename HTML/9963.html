<p>The <strong>Eklutna Dam</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>New Eklutna Dam</strong> or <strong>Upper Eklutna Dam</strong>, is an <a href="embankment_dam" title="wikilink">embankment dam</a> on the <a href="Eklutna_River" title="wikilink">Eklutna River</a> about  northeast of <a href="Anchorage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anchorage</a> in <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. The primary purpose of the dam is <a href="hydroelectric" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroelectric</a> power generation and it supports a 47 MW power plant. It was completed in 1929 but underwent several repairs over the years which concluded with a final raising in 1955. Ownership of the dam and power plant is shared by Anchorage Municipal Light &amp; Power, Chugach Electric and Matanuska Electric.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The original dam was constructed by the Anchorage Light and Power Company between 1927 and 1929 atop a natural <a href="landslide_dam" title="wikilink">landslide dam</a> in the Eklutna Valley.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It regulated the river to the Lower Eklutna Dam which diverted water into the <a href="Eklutna_Power_Plant" title="wikilink">Old Eklutna Power Plant</a>. The dam was rebuilt and improved in 1941 after the previous structure failed. During this same year, the population in Anchorage increased greatly with the onset of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. To cope with increasing power demand, the <a href="United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation" title="wikilink">United States Bureau of Reclamation</a> proposed the Eklutna Project. It included raising the dam and installing a new power plant opposite Goat Mountain to the north, along the <a href="Knik_River" title="wikilink">Knik River</a>. The <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> authorized the project on 31 July 1950. Construction began in 1951 and raising the dam commenced the following year. The first generator was commissioned on 8 January 1955, the second and last on 1 April 1955. On 1 July 1955 the entire project was complete.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

It is filled with  sand, gravel and earth and its crest is  above sea level. The reservoir created by the dam, Eklutna Lake, covers  and is  long. At an elevation of , the reservoir holds  of water. To connect the reservoir and power plant, there is a  diameter,  long <a href="penstock" class="uri" title="wikilink">penstock</a> which starts at the intake, located on the northwest corner of the lake.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> From the intake, water rushes down the penstock where it reaches two 23.5 <a href="watt" title="wikilink">MW</a> <a href="Francis_turbine" title="wikilink">Francis turbine</a>-generators. Water used by the power plant is then discharged into the Knik River.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
