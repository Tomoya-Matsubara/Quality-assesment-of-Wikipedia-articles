<p><strong>Andrew Van de Kamp</strong> is a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> in the <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> television series <em><a href="Desperate_Housewives" title="wikilink">Desperate Housewives</a></em> played by <a href="Shawn_Pyfrom" title="wikilink">Shawn Pyfrom</a>, and is the son of <a href="Bree_Van_de_Kamp" title="wikilink">Bree Van de Kamp</a> and the late <a href="Rex_Van_de_Kamp" title="wikilink">Rex Van de Kamp</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the few <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> characters on <a href="prime_time" title="wikilink">prime time</a> television secure with their sexuality, Andrew's storylines have been well-received by <a href="gay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gay</a> groups. However, his early attitude toward his mother and various crimes have also garnered negative criticism.</p>
<h2 id="season-1">Season 1</h2>
<p>Andrew first appears in the &quot;<a href="Pilot_(Desperate_Housewives_episode)" title="wikilink">Pilot</a>&quot; of season one.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and argues with his mother over her desire for perfection.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by joining him and his friends at a strip club while grounded.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Bree later apologizes to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him but removes the door to his room to punish him for smoking marijuana.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>His parents' acrimonious divorce results in Rex buying Andrew a car. Bree tries to get him to give it back but Andrew refuses. Later that episode, he knocks down <a href="Juanita_&quot;Mama&quot;_Solis" title="wikilink">Juanita Solis</a> while drunk. Juanita survived but was in a coma in hospital.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His parents help him cover it up but Andrew doesn't feel remorse for his crime. He continues misbehaving and Bree gets him dropped from the school swim team in an attempt to make him regret his actions.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Further angered by her refusal to allow Rex to convalesce from heart surgery at home, Andrew threatens, &quot;You wanna see how long I can hold a grudge? Go ahead and abandon my father because I promise you will be sorry.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When he finds out about his father's adultery, however, he apologizes to Bree and is angry with Rex.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When Bree tells Andrew that if he gets his friend Lisa pregnant, he will marry her. Andrew laughs<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> as he is actually developing a relationship with <a href="Justin_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">Justin</a>, who confesses to <a href="Gabrielle_Solis" title="wikilink">Gabrielle Solis</a> that he and Andrew have been &quot;fooling around&quot; for some time.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Andrew later crashes Zach's pool party with Justin and some friends and creates mayhem.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, after everyone else has gone home, <a href="Susan_Mayer" title="wikilink">Susan Mayer</a> catches them naked in the swimming pool kissing; Andrew anxiously shouts, &quot;I'm not, I'm not gay!&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> After he is expelled from school for drug abuse and his rudeness to Bree, Andrew is sent to a juvenile delinquent boot camp.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Andrewvandekampseason1.jpg" title="fig:Andrew stares resentfully at his mother from Camp Hennessey." alt="Andrew stares resentfully at his mother from Camp Hennessey." width="250" /> Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see his father alone; Bree thinks this is because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> There, Rex reveals that Andrew wanted to see him alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home immediately. Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him &quot;I would love you even if you were a murderer&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Bree invites <a href="List_of_Desperate_Housewives_characters#Other_acquaintances_3" title="wikilink">Reverend Sikes</a> to dinner, who tries to convince Andrew to enrol in <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> counselling. He refuses, saying &quot;I'm not confused. I know exactly who I am.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This deeply upsets Bree, who tells him he has to change or he will not be with her in <a href="heaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">heaven</a>; Andrew is shocked and agrees to meet the reverend.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In his final scene of the season, after swearing the reverend to secrecy, Andrew states that not only that he does not believe in <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> but lied to his parents about being gay to get out of the camp.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This confuses the reverend, who asks him if he is heterosexual or not: Andrew replies, &quot;Look, I love vanilla ice cream, okay? But every now and then I&lt;U+2019&gt;m probably gonna be in the mood for chocolate.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He says he will get revenge for Bree rejecting him by pretending to be a model son and then doing something so awful it is &quot;going to really destroy her&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season-2">Season 2</h2>
<p>Set just weeks after Rex's death, Andrew's opening shot in Season 2 is to claim Bree is incapable of murdering his father because &quot;it takes guts to kill somebody&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He resents <a href="George_Williams_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">George Williams</a> for dating Bree while Rex was alive and is rude when he sees him with Bree. Andrew shaved his head after the 1st season.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Bree blackmails Andrew with swim club subs into having dinner with George.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In response, Andrew imitates Bree's pleasure moan to provoke George, who tries sending him to his room but will not tell Bree why. She, however, refuses to punish Andrew without a reason.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> George decides to get rid of Andrew by kissing his mother during his swim meet, angering him so much that he attacks George.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> That evening, Andrew packs his bags for Camp Hennessey a second time.</p>
<p><img src="AndrewandJustininbed.jpg" title="fig:Andrew tries to provoke Bree as far as possible - including exhibiting his sexuality in front of her." alt="Andrew tries to provoke Bree as far as possible - including exhibiting his sexuality in front of her." width="250" /> After George dies, Bree brings Andrew back from the camp and tells him George killed Rex so he could marry her; Andrew is disgusted that his father is dead because of her.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> As a result, Andrew invites Justin to sleep over. He confides his reasons for hating Bree, saying:</p>

<p>He also confides his hope that Bree will slip up so that he can &quot;take her down&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Later, Bree tells Andrew that George didn't commit suicide; he <a href="drug_overdose" title="wikilink">overdosed</a> and asked her to call an ambulance but she watched him die.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>When Bree sees Andrew kissing Justin outside her window, she forbids him from bringing his boyfriend around again.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Andrew mocks her and ensures Bree later walks in them in bed together.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Bree threatens to call the police and have Justin removed, but Andrew replies that he will tell them what happened to George.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This backfires, however, when Bree hires <a href="Karl_Mayer" title="wikilink">Karl Mayer</a>, a lawyer/friend of the family, who explains that Bree has not committed a crime and slams Andrew against a wall, ordering him to leave her alone.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>He and his sister notice Bree's increasing alcohol consumption, and uses it against her. When Bree refuses to let Andrew access his trust fund to buy a car, he calls her a &quot;mean old drunk&quot;, and she slaps him. Andrew emotionally blackmails Justin into punching him in the same place Bree slapped him and hires a lawyer to file for <a href="Emancipation_of_minors" title="wikilink">emancipation</a> from his mother, whom he accuses of hitting him while drunk.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Andrew tries to persuade her in &quot;<a href="There_Is_No_Other_Way" title="wikilink">There Is No Other Way</a>&quot; to let him go, but she refuses. Andrew, after consulting his lawyer, tells Bree that he will accuse her of <a href="child_molestation" title="wikilink">molesting</a> him if he does not get his way. Bree's father and stepmother arrive, and convince the judge to drop the case.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSqUYrJzcqo#">1</a> They try reconciling the two but Andrew persuades them to let him live with them.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Justin is heartbroken when he finds out, and when Bree asks him why, replies:</p>

<p>Bree plants gay magazines and videos in Andrew's belongings for his grandparents to find. Horrified, they leave Andrew behind and revoke his trust fund.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In an attempt to make peace, Bree invites Justin to dinner.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08E4flKBeSU">2</a> Andrew, at this point in time, has attempted to cause his mother pain repeatedly for sinister and unjust causes. Andrew, however, doesn't give up hating his mother or trying to hurt her. He discovers that <a href="List_of_Desperate_Housewives_characters#Bree&#39;s_family" title="wikilink">Peter McMillian</a>, Bree's boyfriend, is a sex addict, and tries persuading Danielle to seduce him.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> After she refuses, he lures Peter into bed himself, where Bree finds them.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Bree gives up and leaves him with a bag of clothes and some money by an abandoned gas station because she can no longer love him unconditionally.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In his final scene, Andrew, realizing he really is about to lose his mom, tells her that the only good thing is that he has won,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Bree - who had already been hurt and betrayed by Andrew repeatedly - simply replies &quot;good for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Eight months later, Bree is about to leave for her honeymoon with <a href="Orson_Hodge" title="wikilink">Orson</a> when she sees a news report on television about homeless teenagers, in which Andrew is interviewed.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Horrified at what has happened to him, she cancels her honeymoon and sets out to find Andrew and asks him to come back but he refuses. When Orson sees how guilty Bree feels, he finds Andrew and buys him lunch.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> During their conversation, Andrew admits he worked the streets as a <a href="rent_boy" title="wikilink">rent boy</a> when he needed money, asking Orson not to tell his mother, before realizing what he's said and correcting himself.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Orson points out that the reason he is living on the streets is to punish his mother but ultimately will only destroy himself.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Andrew does not appear to heed this but goes home at the end of &quot;<a href="A_Weekend_In_the_Country_(Desperate_Housewives_episode)" title="wikilink">A Weekend In the Country</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Bree is delighted, but insists on concocting a reason for Andrew's long absence.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted to see a former client at a school science fair.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Orson is worried about Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Wanting no secrets, Orson tells her that Andrew sold himself for money and that the man he had been talking to was a previous client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, tells her.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> She takes it badly, and tells Bree that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Later, Andrew sees her argue with Danielle and, concerned, tries comforting Bree by explaining that she did instill moral values, &quot;I mean, we know the difference between right and wrong, we just chose wrong&quot;, but also that she pushed them so hard, they had to rebel.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Bree tries to get him to talk about his prostitution but he brushes her off.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Andrew has a job, working at <a href="Tom_Scavo" title="wikilink">Tom's</a> pizzeria, taking a fairly lax attitude to his work.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>When Andrew overhears a conversation between Bree and Orson about the death of <a href="List_of_Desperate_Housewives_characters#Other_acquaintances_3" title="wikilink">Monique Polier</a>, he believes Orson is responsible when Bree falls from a rigged ladder. Warning Orson that he has never met &quot;bad Andrew&quot;, but will if he harms Bree further, Andrew tells the nurse that Orson is dangerous and should not be left alone with Bree. Later, Andrew leaves Danielle to look after Bree, but she is upset that she cannot go to Scavos' pizzeria. Danielle leaves Bree with Gloria, who unexpectedly shows up with soup. At the pizzeria, Andrew sees Danielle and she admits leaving Bree with Gloria, so he rushes home. However, Gloria knocks him out as she was responsible for harming Bree and intends to kill her. When Andrew comes round, he discovers that Orson was actually trying to protect Bree, and their relationship returns to normal.</p>
<p>Andrew had no romance this season, though he tells Danielle and Julie that he tried seducing <a href="Austin_McCann_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">Austin McCann</a>, Edie's nephew. Andrew convinces Austin to leave Fairview after getting Danielle pregnant.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In the episode &quot;<a href="Liaisons_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">Liaisons</a>&quot; Andrew reveals he is only working at the Scavo's Pizzeria for $8.50 an hour because he is &quot;doing the beer delivery guy.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="season-4">Season 4</h2>
<p>Andrew accidentally leads his grandmother to discover that Bree is not really pregnant. He is there when his sister, Danielle, gives birth to her son.</p>
<p>After Andrew hears his mother talking about how she looks forward to this new chance to finally raise a child correctly, he becomes upset. He decides to move out of his mother's house and get his own apartment. Bree feels guilty and brings food to his house. Andrew tells his mother that he is not angry anymore and has forgiven her, he's moved out in order to try and turn his life around and stand on his own. Bree and Andrew are finally able to reach a full reconciliation. Andrew then makes Bree use a coaster for her drink, providing a humorous moment between the two as she thinks he is becoming more like her. In the season finale, in a scene set five years in the future, Andrew is in business with Bree, who is now a successful author.</p>
<h2 id="season-5">Season 5</h2>
<p>This season Shawn Pyfrom is promoted from &quot;also-starring&quot; to &quot;starring&quot;.</p>
<p>Five years later, Andrew is now the personal assistant of his mother, Bree, who, with her new cookbook, is a rising public figure similar to <a href="Martha_Stewart" title="wikilink">Martha Stewart</a>. He has appeared to have matured and is usually seen alongside his mother wearing a suit. He apparently makes a decent living as he owns a sports car.</p>
<p><a href="Orson_Hodge" title="wikilink">Orson Hodge</a>'s plastic surgeon, Alex Cominis, is Andrew's fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;. When Bree discovers that Alex was once in <a href="gay_porn" title="wikilink">gay porn</a>, she tells Andrew and is surprised to learn that Andrew already knew and did not judge Alex for his past mistakes as he himself has a &quot;sordid past&quot; (referring to the feud between himself and his mother following the death of his father, and his work as a <a href="rent_boy" title="wikilink">rent boy</a> seven years earlier).</p>
<p>Andrew accuses Bree of being too protective by investigating Alex. She admits to this, and Andrew — to her surprise — is glad. It is then insinuated that Bree has come to accept her son's sexuality and plans on handling the wedding. When Andrew's soon-to-be mother in-law comes to town, in order to out-do her Bree decides to buy Andrew and Alex the former home of <a href="List_of_Desperate_Housewives_characters#Martha_Huber" title="wikilink">Martha Huber</a> and <a href="List_of_Desperate_Housewives_characters#Felicia_Tilman" title="wikilink">Felicia Tilman</a>, which is only two houses down and on Wisteria Lane.</p>
<h2 id="season-6">Season 6</h2>
<p>Shawn Pyform has quit <em>Desperate Housewives</em> and will not be returning as a series regular.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> He will, however, continue to make occasional guest appearances.</p>
<p>He first returns in <a href="The_God-Why-Don&#39;t-You-Love-Me_Blues" title="wikilink">&quot;The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues</a>&quot; to visit <a href="Julie_Mayer" title="wikilink">Julie Mayer</a> while she is in the hospital. There he reveals to her mother, <a href="Susan_Delfino" title="wikilink">Susan Delfino</a>, that she dropped out of Medical School and has been a waitress while figuring out what to do with her life. He also reveals that she has been involved with a married man who turns out to be Angie's husband, Nick.</p>
<p>Andrew appears in a non-speaking cameo, gardening with Bree in &quot;<a href="You_Gotta_Get_a_Gimmick" title="wikilink">You Gotta Get a Gimmick</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In <a href="The_Chase_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">&quot;The Chase&quot;</a>, Bree's new employee Sam Allen (<a href="Samuel_Page" title="wikilink">Samuel Page</a>) suggests that Andrew has been sleeping with incompetent employee Tad (Eric Ian Colton). Andrew admits to Sam and his Mother that he had a one-time affair with Tad, and defends his actions by stating he had been drinking when Tad came on to him. Bree mentions that Andrew still lives together with Alex, insinuating he is practically committing adultery. Andrew takes this as an opportunity to throw his knowledge of Bree's own affair with <a href="Karl_Mayer" title="wikilink">Karl Mayer</a> in her face. It becomes clear that Andrew and Sam do not like each other, and that Sam's place with the company will be a source of conflict between Andrew and Bree. Sam soon reveals that he is Rex's son and Bree welcomes him into the family. Andrew isn't happy with his presence and he and Orson are both suspicious of Sam's true intentions and decide to investigate. Bree soon realizes Sam is emotionally unstable and tries to fire him. However, Sam has discovered (via a drunken Danielle) how Andrew killed Carlos' mother and blackmails her into signing over the company to him. Orson, who had been unaware of Andrew's crime, is upset at Bree covering for her son while demanding Orson turn himself in for his hit-and-run of Mike and leaves Bree. Realizing Orson is right, Bree tells Andrew she has to tell Gabrielle the truth.</p>
<h2 id="season-7">Season 7</h2>
<p>Bree reveals the truth to Gabrielle in <a href="Remember_Paul?" title="wikilink">Remember Paul?</a>, and they agree not to tell Carlos for the sake of Andrew's safety and the Solis marriage (Andrew does not appear in this episode). In <a href="You_Must_Meet_My_Wife" title="wikilink">You Must Meet My Wife</a> Bree accidentally hits Juanita with her car, which is very ironic since she is named for her Grandmother who Andrew ran over with his car years ago. Bree and Andrew go to the hospital to make sure Juanita is okay. There, Andrew thanks Gaby for not telling Carlos, and she yells at both him and Bree for trying to run down her whole family. Later on, she forgives them both.</p>
<p>Andrew next appears in <a href="Down_the_Block_There&#39;s_a_Riot" title="wikilink">Down the Block There's a Riot</a>. Lynette knocks on Andrew's door to make sure Andrew has no intention of selling his house to <a href="Paul_Young_(Desperate_Housewives)" title="wikilink">Paul Young</a>. Andrew acts insulted and asks &quot;do you really think I would do that to my mother?&quot; and Lynette replies &quot;I don't know, you were pretty nasty as a teenager&quot;. Andrew is also seen at the homeowners meeting, and during the riot.</p>
<h2 id="characterization">Characterization</h2>
<p>Andrew is partially based on writer <a href="Marc_Cherry" title="wikilink">Marc Cherry</a> himself, who copied much of Bree's dialogue from his own mother's reaction when he came out to her.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Andrew can be selfish and manipulative, and regularly uses other people to get what he wants, for example, persuading his boyfriend Justin to hit him so he can claim Bree is abusing him. He has also committed a range of crimes, from being expelled from school for smoking <a href="marijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">marijuana</a>, to <a href="Anything_You_Can_Do_(Desperate_Housewives_episode)" title="wikilink">running over</a> Mam&lt;U+00E1&gt; Solis while drunk.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> After Bree hushed up the accident for him, he then refused to feel bad, reasoning &quot;She's an old lady! I have my whole life ahead of me!&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Marc Cherry has referred to him as being <a href="Psychopathy" title="wikilink">sociopathic</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In Season 3, however, Andrew seems to have matured after spending eight months living on the streets.</p>
<p>While fans have heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, implying he is bisexual.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> When asked whether Andrew was specifically gay or bisexual, Pyfrom stated &quot;I really don&lt;U+2019&gt;t even know at this point. I mean, he did make that statement [that&lt;U+2019&gt;s he&lt;U+2019&gt;s bisexual]. I think he&lt;U+2019&gt;s a little more gay than he is straight, though.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In &quot;<a href="My_Husband,_the_Pig" title="wikilink">My Husband, the Pig</a>&quot;, he refers to Austin as a &quot;dog&quot; and himself as a &quot;dog-lover&quot;. Whatever Andrew is, he is one of a few LGBT teens on television secure with his sexuality.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Marc Cherry has commented, &quot;Andrew Van de Kamp is perhaps the most empowered gay teen in the history of television. He's gay and he doesn't care.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>From Andrew's hurt reaction to his mother's rejection of him, it appears that he deeply loves his mother, as his determination to hurt her in Season 2 is so he can &quot;stop loving her first&quot;. He also loves and respects his father, and it is only Rex who can get him to stop tormenting Bree in Season 1, albeit briefly. Later on in Season 2, Karl, another strong male figure, has some similar success in forcing Andrew to stop harassing Bree temporarily. In Season 3, it is Orson, and not Bree, who persuades Andrew to return home and whom he continues to respect throughout the season.</p>
<p>Andrew is very protective of his mother, as is shown in Season 2 when he attacks George after George tries to kiss Bree against her will, and then in Season 3 where he threatens Orson under the belief that Orson may hurt Bree. By the fifth season, a more mature Andrew has inherited traits that he once ridiculed his mother for having, such as blunt sarcasm. His relationship with his mother has also changed dramatically for the better.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>
<p>As Andrew is a minor character in <em>Desperate Housewives</em>, he is rarely mentioned by critics. However, his storylines have occasionally attracted press coverage. In 2005, when Andrew kissed character Justin while engaging in late night <a href="foreplay" class="uri" title="wikilink">foreplay</a> in a pool in the episode &quot;<a href="Impossible_(Desperate_Housewives_episode)" title="wikilink">Impossible</a>&quot;, gay groups applauded a primetime television show willing to show a romantic gay kiss; only six network television shows had done so in the past twenty years, as opposed to thirty for lesbian kisses.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Despite the fact that Christian and conservative groups had protested <em>Desperate Housewives</em> before it had even aired, few prominent leaders said anything about the kiss.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Shawn Pyfrom has stated that he has received many letters from gay teens who have been encouraged by Andrew's ease with his sexuality as one of the few secure and confident <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> teenage characters on television.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Marc Cherry has expressed bemusement at this, saying, &quot;to young people, Andrew is something of a role model which is a little appalling to me because he's something of a <a href="antisocial_personality_disorder" title="wikilink">sociopath</a>!&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> However, Pyfrom commented that he saw this as a good thing:</p>

<p>Andrew's relentless torment of his mother and other devious exploits have been negatively received by critics, with one declaring him a &quot;Class-A jerk&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The Parent's Television Council named &quot;<a href="I_Know_Things_Now_(Desperate_Housewives_episode)" title="wikilink">I Know Things Now</a>&quot; as their &quot;Worst Episode of the Week&quot;, in part due to Andrew's seduction of Bree's boyfriend.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> However, his improved behavior and deep love for his mother in Season 3 has also disappointed some critics, with one saying &quot;if he has any lines at all, he's a little angel...as if he's become something of a Stepford son!&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
