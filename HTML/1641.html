<p><strong>Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland</strong> <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">MC</a>, <a href="Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">DFC</a>, <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">AFC</a> (5 August 1894 – before 7 November 1983) was an Australian <a href="flying_ace" title="wikilink">fighter ace</a> in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. Born in <a href="Maitland,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Maitland</a>, New South Wales, he commenced service as a <a href="Australian_Light_Horse" title="wikilink">Lighthorseman</a> with the <a href="First_Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> in 1915, and saw action at <a href="Gallipoli_campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a>. He transferred to the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> the following year, rising to <a href="Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)" title="wikilink">Captain</a>. Credited with twenty-three aerial victories, Pentland became the fifth highest-scoring Australian ace of the war, after <a href="Robert_A._Little" title="wikilink">Robert Little</a>, <a href="Roderic_Dallas" title="wikilink">Roderic Dallas</a>, <a href="Arthur_Henry_Cobby" title="wikilink">Harry Cobby</a> and <a href="Elwyn_King" title="wikilink">Elwyn King</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a> in January 1918 for &quot;conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty&quot; on a mission attacking an aerodrome behind enemy lines, and the <a href="Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> that August for engaging four hostile aircraft single-handedly.</p>
<p>Pentland served in the fledgling <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), and later the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a>, before going into business in 1927. His ventures included commercial flying around the goldfields of <a href="Territory_of_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>, aircraft design and manufacture, flight instruction, and charter work. In the early 1930s, he was employed as a pilot with <a href="Australian_National_Airways" title="wikilink">Australian National Airways</a>, and also spent time as a dairy farmer. Soon after the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, he re-enlisted in the RAAF, attaining the rank of <a href="Squadron_Leader" title="wikilink">Squadron Leader</a> and commanding rescue and communications units in the <a href="South_West_Pacific_theatre_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">South West Pacific</a>. Perhaps the oldest operational pilot in the wartime RAAF, Pentland was responsible for rescuing a number of airmen, soldiers and civilians, and earned the <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Air Force Cross</a> for his &quot;outstanding courage, initiative and skill&quot;. He became a trader in New Guinea when the war ended in 1945, and later a coffee planter. Retiring in 1959, he died in 1983 at the age of eighty-nine.</p>

<p>Of Irish ancestry, Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland (nicknamed &quot;Jerry&quot;) was born in <a href="Maitland,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Maitland</a>, New South Wales on 5 August 1894.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Educated at <a href="The_King&#39;s_School,_Parramatta" title="wikilink">The King's School</a>, Sydney, and <a href="Brighton_Grammar_School" title="wikilink">Brighton Grammar</a>, Melbourne, he went on to study dairy farming at <a href="Hawkesbury_Agricultural_College" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury Agricultural College</a>, and later worked as a <a href="Stockman" title="wikilink">jackaroo</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His father, also named Alexander, was a physician who joined the <a href="First_Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and served as a <a href="Major" class="uri" title="wikilink">Major</a> in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Army_Medical_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian Army Medical Corps</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Pentland enlisted as a <a href="Private_(rank)" title="wikilink">private</a> in the AIF on 5 March 1915, sailing for Egypt with the <a href="Australian_Mounted_Division" title="wikilink">12th Light Horse Regiment</a> aboard HMAT A29 <em>Suevic</em> on 13 June.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In August, his unit deployed to <a href="Gallipoli_campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> where he fought as a machine gunner before being hospitalised the following month, suffering from <a href="typhoid_fever" title="wikilink">typhoid fever</a>; he was evacuated to England in December.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Determined to leave the trenches behind after recovering, he volunteered for the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> and was discharged from the AIF on 21 February 1916 to take up his commission as a temporary <a href="Second_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Second Lieutenant</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> His first solo flight in a <a href="Farman_MF.7" title="wikilink">Maurice Farman Longhorn</a> at <a href="Brooklands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklands</a>, after two hours of dual instruction, ended with him overshooting the runway and crashing in a sewage farm, but he was unhurt and immediately undertook a second solo attempt, landing successfully.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After completing pilot training, he was posted to France in June, flying <a href="Royal_Aircraft_Factory_B.E.2" title="wikilink">B.E.2s</a> with <a href="No._16_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 16 Squadron</a>. Though the slow and vulnerable B.E.2 was considered &quot;<a href="Fokker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fokker</a> fodder&quot; by its crews, Pentland and his observer quickly managed to score the former's first aerial victory, bringing down a German <a href="Fokker_Eindecker" title="wikilink"><em>Eindecker</em></a> over <a href="Haubourdin" title="wikilink">Habourdin</a> on 9 June.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He was then posted to <a href="No._29_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 29 Squadron</a> and was converting to <a href="Airco_DH.2" title="wikilink">DH.2</a> <a href="Pusher_configuration" title="wikilink">&quot;pusher&quot;</a> fighters when he broke his leg playing rugby. After recovering, he <a href="Flight_instructor" title="wikilink">instructed</a> at <a href="London_Colney" title="wikilink">London Colney</a> until June 1917, when he joined <a href="No._19_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 19 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="SPAD_S.VII" title="wikilink">SPAD S.VIIs</a>. This would become Pentland's favourite type due to its strength and manouverability, even though it had to be 'flown' constantly and was unforgiving at low speed.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

He followed this up with a solo &quot;kill&quot; on 12 August.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Four days later, after stopping an enemy truck convoy in its tracks by crippling its lead vehicle with machine-gun fire, he reportedly engaged ten Albatros fighters single-handedly; by the time he had driven them off, four bullets had penetrated his leather flying suit without injuring him, while his plane had absorbed so much punishment that it had to be scrapped when he got back to base.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After sharing another Albatros two-seater on 20 August, Pentland led a raid on Marcke aerodrome, home of <a href="Manfred_von_Richthofen" title="wikilink">Baron von Richtofen</a>'s <a href="Jasta_11" title="wikilink"><em>Jasta</em> 11</a>, on 26 August. On the way, he helped bring down a <a href="DFW_C.V" title="wikilink">DFW C.V</a>, then achieved complete surprise at the airfield, which he and his flight proceeded to shoot up. On the return journey, he strafed an enemy train until his guns jammed and then, having managed to clear them, engaged two more German scouts. His part in the raid earned him the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a>, which was promulgated in <em><a href="The_London_Gazette" title="wikilink">The London Gazette</a></em> on 9 January 1918:<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

Following his recovery, he again spent time instructing before being posted back to a front-line unit, this time <a href="No._87_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 87 Squadron</a>, operating <a href="Sopwith_Dolphin" title="wikilink">Sopwith Dolphins</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Promoted <a href="Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)" title="wikilink">Captain</a>, he returned to France in April 1918, having transferred the same month with the rest of the RFC to the newly formed <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Pentland went on to achieve thirteen victories with No. 87 Squadron, where his aggressive tactics saw him dubbed the &quot;Wild Australian&quot; by colleagues. Appointed commander of 'B' Flight, he also frequently acted as a &quot;lone wolf&quot;, actively seeking dogfights with enemy aircraft on his own.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> On 18 June, he was alone on patrol when he engaged a flight of four <a href="Rumpler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rumpler</a> high-altitude <a href="aerial_reconnaissance" title="wikilink">reconnaissance</a> aircraft, forcing down three of them.

<h2 id="between-the-wars">Between the wars</h2>
<p>Pentland relinquished his RAF commission and returned to Australia at the end of the war, earning money by giving joyrides to paying customers in an <a href="Avro_504K" title="wikilink">Avro 504K</a>. Looking for a more secure future, he joined the newly established <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in August 1921, following an interview with <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Wing Commander</a> <a href="Stanley_Goble" title="wikilink">Stanley Goble</a>, a wartime acquaintance through the RAF. Ranked <a href="Flight_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Flight Lieutenant</a>, Pentland was put in charge of the RAAF's complement of <a href="Royal_Aircraft_Factory_S.E.5" title="wikilink">S.E.5</a> fighters at <a href="Point_Cook,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, part of the 'Imperial Gift' recently donated by Great Britain.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The young Air Force had the atmosphere of a flying club, where everyone knew everyone else. However, tensions sometimes arose between those who had served with British forces during the war, and those who had belonged to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC); the former considered that they were discriminated against when it came to filling senior positions, and came the day Pentland and fellow ex-RAF member <a href="Hippolyte_De_La_Rue" title="wikilink">Hippolyte De La Rue</a> threw an &quot;uppity&quot; AFC man into a <a href="mess" class="uri" title="wikilink">mess</a> fireplace.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Deciding that his RAAF career was not progressing, Pentland applied for a short-service commission as a <a href="Flying_Officer" title="wikilink">Flying Officer</a> with the RAF in 1923, which was granted as of 23 April.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He journeyed to Britain with new wife Madge, whom he had married just before departing Australia; they had one daughter, Carleen, the following year.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Pentland completed the course at <a href="Central_Flying_School" title="wikilink">Central Flying School</a>, Uphavon and became an instructor there, gaining promotion to Flight Lieutenant before leaving active service with the RAF on 20 July 1926 and returning to Australia.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

The pair bought a <a href="de_Havilland_DH.60_Moth" title="wikilink">DH.60 Moth</a> biplane, which Pentland ferried to the firm's base at <a href="Lae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lae</a> in February 1928.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The business prospered in the short term, to the extent that the partners took on another Moth and more pilots. By the end of the year, however, Pentland was suffering from <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a> and had to abandon the venture, selling one of the planes to Guinea Airways and returning to Australia with the other.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> After recovering in the new year, he embarked on a series of new enterprises, including aircraft manufacture, a flying school, and charter work. In February 1929, he formed the General Aircraft Company with Royal and another partner to produce an Australian-designed aeroplane, the Genairco, of which eight were eventually sold. With the Moth from Mandated Territory Airways, he established Pentland's Flying School at <a href="Sydney_Airport" title="wikilink">Mascot</a>, New South Wales. He also flew charters with a Moth owned by <em>The Sun</em> newspaper, using the same aircraft that September to compete in the <a href="Western_Australian_Centenary_Air_Race" title="wikilink">East-West Air Race</a> from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the <a href="Centenary_of_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australia Centenary</a>. The event attracted a number of veteran aviators of World War I, including <a href="Horrie_Miller_(aviator)" title="wikilink">Horrie Miller</a>—the eventual winner on handicap—and <a href="Charles_Eaton_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Charles Eaton</a>, whom Pentland beat into fifth place across the line.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Lack of patronage led to Pentland folding his businesses and taking a job in 1930 as a pilot with <a href="Australian_National_Airways" title="wikilink">Australian National Airways</a> (ANA), a new airline founded by <a href="Charles_Kingsford-Smith" title="wikilink">Charles Kingsford-Smith</a> and <a href="Charles_Ulm" title="wikilink">Charles Ulm</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at <a href="Singleton,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Singleton</a>. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> and <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where he was known as a practical joker who liked to hold a map in front of his face in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after <a href="Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">war was declared</a> in September 1939.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>With the end of hostilities in the Pacific, Pentland was discharged from the RAAF on 2 November 1945.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He took the opportunity to purchase surplus military equipment in New Guinea and established himself as a trader in <a href="Finschhafen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finschhafen</a>, later expanding to Lae and <a href="Wau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wau</a>. In 1948, he went into business as a coffee planter in <a href="Goroka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goroka</a>, and also recruited labour from the highlands for industries on the coast. Prospering as a planter, he contributed to development of the region by building Goroka's original constant-flowing water supply and encouraging other businesses to set up there. His ongoing commitments in New Guinea meant that he was not <a href="Investiture" title="wikilink">invested</a> with his AFC until 1950. In 1959, he sold his interests in Goroka and retired with Madge to their seaside home in <a href="Bayview,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bayview</a>, New South Wales.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Madge Pentland died in 1982, and Jerry eighteen months later at the War Veterans Home in nearby <a href="Collaroy,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Collaroy</a>.
