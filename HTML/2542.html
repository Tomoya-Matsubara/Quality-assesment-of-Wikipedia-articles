The team struggled in the first class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and only looked like having a chance of winning in the last match against <a href="Kent_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Kent</a>. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.</p>

Bangladesh A proceeded to gift away 35 <a href="extra_(cricket)" title="wikilink">extras</a> - including 21 in wides - which probably cost them the match, as the Universities passed their score with ten balls remaining. <a href="Talha_Jubair" title="wikilink">Talha Jubair</a> and <a href="Abdur_Razzak_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Abdur Razzak</a> showed promising things with the ball, though, taking four for 50 and two for 37 respectively. <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/BDESH-A_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/BDESH-A_BRIT-UNIV_18JUL2005.html">(Cricinfo scorecard)</a></p>

However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class the second time around, and after losing <a href="Kadeer_Ali" title="wikilink">Kadeer Ali</a> for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before <a href="declaration_and_forfeiture" title="wikilink">declaring</a> as <a href="Alex_Gidman" title="wikilink">Alex Gidman</a> recorded a 94-ball <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a>.

<p>A second-string <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> pummeled the Bangladeshi bowlers, and despite the short timeframe - three days instead of the County Championship's four - they still got a win. With a run-rate of more than four an over they quickly made their way to 357 for 2 on the first day - <a href="Matthew_Wood_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Matthew Wood</a> made an unbeaten 202, five short of his career highest score, and shared an opening partnership worth 272 with <a href="Joe_Sayers" title="wikilink">Joe Sayers</a>.

The <a href="Bangladesh_A_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Bangladesh A</a> tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost <a href="Nafees_Iqbal" title="wikilink">Nafees Iqbal</a> for a duck.
