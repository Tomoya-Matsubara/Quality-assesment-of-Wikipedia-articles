<p><strong>Charles Bernard &quot;Charlie&quot; Rangel</strong> (;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> born June 11, 1930)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> for , serving since 1971. A member of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, he is the <a href="List_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_longevity_of_service#House_time" title="wikilink">third-longest currently serving member of the House of Representatives</a>. As its most senior member, he is also the Dean of New York's congressional delegation. In January 2007, Rangel became Chair of the powerful <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means" title="wikilink">House Ways and Means Committee</a>, the first <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> to do so. He is also a founding member of the <a href="Congressional_Black_Caucus" title="wikilink">Congressional Black Caucus</a>.</p>
<p>Rangel was born in <a href="Harlem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harlem</a> in New York City, and had a somewhat troubled childhood. He earned a <a href="Purple_Heart" title="wikilink">Purple Heart</a> and a <a href="Bronze_Star_Medal" title="wikilink">Bronze Star</a> for his service in the <a href="U.S._Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a> during the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>, where he led a group of soldiers out of a deadly <a href="People&#39;s_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Chinese Army</a> encirclement during the <a href="Battle_of_Kunu-ri" title="wikilink">Battle of Kunu-ri</a> in 1950. Rangel graduated from <a href="New_York_University" title="wikilink">New York University</a> in 1957, and <a href="St._John&#39;s_University_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">St. John's University School of Law</a> in 1960. He then worked as a private lawyer, <a href="United_States_Attorney" title="wikilink">Assistant U.S. Attorney</a>, and legal counsel during the early-mid 1960s. He served two terms in the <a href="New_York_State_Assembly" title="wikilink">New York State Assembly</a>, from 1967 to 1970, and then defeated long-time incumbent Congressman <a href="Adam_Clayton_Powell,_Jr." title="wikilink">Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.</a> in a primary challenge on his way to being elected to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Once there, Rangel rose rapidly in the Democratic ranks, combining solidly <a href="American_liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal views</a> with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. His long-time concerns with battling the importation and effects of illegal drugs led to his becoming chair of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, where he helped define national policy on the issue during the 1980s. As one of Harlem's <a href="Gang_of_Four_(Harlem)" title="wikilink">&quot;Gang of Four&quot;</a>, he also became a leader in New York City and State politics. He played a significant role in the creation of the 1995 <a href="Upper_Manhattan_Empowerment_Zone_Development_Corporation" title="wikilink">Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation</a> and the national Empowerment Zone Act, which helped change the economic face of Harlem and other inner-city areas. Rangel is known both for his genial manner, with an ability to win over fellow legislators, and for his blunt speaking; he has long been outspoken about his views, and has been arrested several times as part of political demonstrations. He was an adamant opponent of the <a href="George_W._Bush_administration" title="wikilink">George W. Bush administration</a> and of the <a href="Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iraq War</a>, and put forth proposals to reinstate <a href="Conscription_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">the draft</a> during the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2008, Rangel faced a series of allegations of ethics violations and failures to comply with tax laws. The <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Standards_of_Official_Conduct" title="wikilink">House Ethics Committee</a> focused on whether Rangel improperly rented multiple <a href="Rent_control_in_New_York" title="wikilink">rent-stabilized New York apartments</a>, improperly used his office in raising money for the Rangel Center at the <a href="City_College_of_New_York" title="wikilink">City College of New York</a>, and failed to disclose rental income from his villa in the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a>. In March 2010, Rangel stepped aside as Ways and Means Chair. In November 2010, the Ethics Committee found Rangel guilty of 11 counts of violating House ethics rules, and on December 2, the full House approved <a href="Censure_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">a sanction of censure</a> against Rangel. </p>

In the <a href="Battle_of_Kunu-ri" title="wikilink">Battle of Kunu-ri</a>, the 2nd Infantry was assigned to hold a road position near <a href="Kunu-ri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kunu-ri</a> while the rest of the <a href="Eighth_United_States_Army" title="wikilink">Eighth Army</a> retreated to <a href="Sunchon,_North_Korea" title="wikilink">Sunchon</a>, 21 miles further south. On the night of November 29, the 2nd Infantry was attacked by gradually encircling forces of the <a href="People&#39;s_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Chinese Army</a>, who set up a fireblock to cut off any U.S. retreat. The eerie blare of Chinese night-fighting bugle calls and communication flares<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> piercing the freezing air led to what Rangel later described as a &quot;waking nightmare, scene by scene, and we couldn't see any possible way out of the situation.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> During the day of November 30, the order came to withdraw the 2nd Infantry in phases, but the 503rd Artillery Battalion was sixth of eight in the order and could not get out in daylight when air cover was possible.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>On the night of November 30, Rangel was part of a retreating vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In the subzero cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try and escape over an imposing mountain: &quot;From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better on the other side of that damn mountain.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Others nearby looked to Rangel, who though only a <a href="private_first_class" title="wikilink">private first class</a> had a reputation for leadership in the unit and had gained the nickname &quot;Sarge&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Rangel led some 40 men from his unit over the mountain during the night and out of the Chinese encirclement.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Other groups were trying to do the same, but some men dropped from the severe conditions or got lost and were never heard from again.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> By midday on December 1, U.S. aircraft were dropping supplies and directions to Rangel's group and others, and had a raft ready to take them across the <a href="Taedong_River" title="wikilink">Taedong River</a>; groups from the 503rd Artillery reached Sunchon that afternoon.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Overall, no part of the 2nd Infantry suffered as many casualties as the artillery;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> it tried to save, but eventually lost, all its guns,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and nearly half of the battalion was killed in the overall battle.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Congressional ethics experts said the difference in rent between what Rangel was paying and market rates, an estimated $30,000 per year, could be construed as a gift, exceeding the $100 House of Representatives gift limit.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> In late July, the House voted 254&lt;U+2013&gt;138 to <a href="Table_(parliamentary_procedure)" title="wikilink">table</a> a resolution by Republican Minority Leader <a href="John_Boehner" title="wikilink">John Boehner</a> that would have censured Rangel for having &quot;dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House&quot;, by occupying the four apartments.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>

<p>Labor lawyer <a href="Theodore_Kheel" title="wikilink">Theodore Kheel</a>, a principal investor in the resort development company and frequent campaign contributor to Rangel, had encouraged him to purchase the villa.

<p>In August 2009, Rangel amended his 2007 financial disclosure form to report more than $500,000 in previously unreported assets and income.

But he was not considered for the ranking member slot either, which after a contested election among the Democratic caucus had gone to former acting chair Sander Levin.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a> Nor were his issues completely over; the <a href="National_Legal_and_Policy_Center" title="wikilink">National Legal and Policy Center</a>, which had acted against him before, filed a complaint with the <a href="Federal_Election_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Election Commission</a> alleging that he had improperly paid some legal bills from a political action committee.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses, he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee).<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a></p>
<p>In general, though, Rangel said that he wanted to &quot;pick up the pieces and move on&quot;,<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> and he predicted that even though Republicans were in the majority again, they would have trouble uniting with newer members beholden to the <a href="Tea_Party_movement" title="wikilink">Tea Party movement</a>.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a></p>

Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is.&quot;<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a> The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called &quot;Rangeling&quot; by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a> Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide <a href="Chris_Matthews" title="wikilink">Chris Matthews</a> said these members were &quot;tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent.&quot;<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"><sup>368</sup></a></p>
<p>Rangel has been described as having a meticulous appearance.<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a> Long-time mentor <a href="Percy_Sutton" title="wikilink">Percy Sutton</a> recalled, &lt;U+201C&gt;In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because he was one of those handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a> Later, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> described him thusly: &quot;After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally.&quot;<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"><sup>371</sup></a> In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of.<a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372"><sup>372</sup></a> The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373"><sup>373</sup></a> Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's <a href="Plaza_Hotel" title="wikilink">Plaza Hotel</a>.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374"><sup>374</sup></a></p>
<p>Rangel is known for his blunt speaking and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally.<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375"><sup>375</sup></a> This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376"><sup>376</sup></a> When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, &quot;Well, as Rhett Butler once said in <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn.&quot;<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377"><sup>377</sup></a> In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.</p>
<p>Some have been linked to his caustic criticism of the Bush administration during the decade of the 2000s. For instance, his frustration over <a href="Criticism_of_government_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina</a> led him to compare, in September 2005, Bush to <a href="Bull_Connor" title="wikilink">a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the African-American civil rights movement</a>, stating: &quot;George Bush is our Bull Connor.&quot;<a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378"><sup>378</sup></a> (Rangel's comparison was still being cited by political commentators several years later as an example of incendiary rhetoric.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379"><sup>379</sup></a><a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"><sup>380</sup></a>) This led at the time to a public exchange of unpleasantries with Vice President <a href="Dick_Cheney" title="wikilink">Dick Cheney</a>,<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"><sup>381</sup></a> who said, &quot;I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me &lt;U+2014&gt; they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some &lt;U+2014&gt; Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess.&quot;<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382"><sup>382</sup></a> Rangel responded by saying, &quot;The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five.&quot;<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"><sup>383</sup></a> Rangel again expressed his displeasure with the vice president in October 2006 &lt;U+2013&gt; after Cheney had said that &quot;Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; by opining that Cheney is &quot;a real son of a bitch&quot; who &quot;enjoys a confrontation&quot;, and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects.<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384"><sup>384</sup></a><a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"><sup>385</sup></a> The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a &quot;big hearty laugh&quot; over them.<a href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386"><sup>386</sup></a></p>
<p>Rangel could sometimes find the other side; following the <a href="2006_Hugo_Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez_speech_at_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">2006 Hugo Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez speech at the United Nations</a> in which the Venezuelan leader implied that Bush was the devil, Rangel said, &quot;I want President Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez to please understand that even though many people in the United States are critical of our president that we resent the fact that he would come to the United States and criticize President Bush ... you don't come into my country, you don't come into my congressional district and you don't condemn my president.&quot;<a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387"><sup>387</sup></a></p>
<p>Other remarks of Rangel's have revolved around Rangel's feelings about his home state and city, such as disparaging the state of Mississippi<a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388"><sup>388</sup></a> or suggesting that President Obama and First Lady <a href="Michelle_Obama" title="wikilink">Michelle Obama</a> might be unsafe if they visited New York.<a href="#fn389" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389"><sup>389</sup></a> In both cases, apologies from the congressman followed. And some have just compounded problems that Rangel already had, such as remarks after his ethics issues had started coming to light about Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a> being &quot;disabled&quot; that were seen by some as insensitive in light of her family or as evidence that Rangel was out of control.<a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390"><sup>390</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn6">Rangel's mother was an African American, with some tolerated miscegenation having occurred in the rural Virginia past: Rangel's great-great-grandfather was white. See Rangel, <em>And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since</em>, pp. 1-2. In Puerto Rican circles in New York, Rangel's father is often thought to have been a Puerto Rican. Rangel's congressional staff has denied that this is a certainty, saying that Rangel never knew his father and knows only that he came from a town in southern Virginia, and that Rangel has not denied the possibility that his father was originally from Puerto Rico. See  Rangel's purported partial Puerto Rican heritage was alluded to by <a href="Herman_Badillo" title="wikilink">Herman Badillo</a> during multi-way ethnic mudslinging among New York politicos late in the <a href="New_York_City_mayoral_election,_1993" title="wikilink">1993 mayoral election</a>.

<li id="fn388">In November 2006, Rangel, in announcing some of his plans as new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he planned to push more funds into his home state of New York. He added to this, &quot;Mississippi gets more than their fair share back in federal money, but who the hell wants to live in Mississippi?&quot; Mississippi Representative <a href="Chip_Pickering" title="wikilink">Chip Pickering</a> demanded an apology and Rangel issued a statement declaring: &quot;I certainly don't mean to offend anyone. I just love New York so much that I can't understand why everyone wouldn't want to live here.&quot; See <a href="#fnref388" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn389">In May 2009, when asked by the <em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Daily News</a></em> what President Obama and First Lady <a href="Michelle_Obama" title="wikilink">Michelle Obama</a> should do during a visit to New York, Rangel replied, &quot;Make certain he doesn't run around in East Harlem unidentified.&quot; Rangel said this following the accidental shooting of African-American <a href="New_York_Police_Department" title="wikilink">New York Police Department</a> officer Omar Edwards by Caucasian fellow officer Andrew Dunton, an incident of mistaken identity. See  The comment was criticized by New York City Mayor <a href="Michael_Bloomberg" title="wikilink">Michael Bloomberg</a>, who said, &quot;I have a lot of respect for Charlie Rangel, but in this case, he's just plain wrong. This was a tragedy. Our police department is diverse, and they train; sometimes things happen and they're inexplicable. There's no reason to suspect this had any racial overtones.&quot; See  Rangel soon apologized for the comment, saying, &quot;It was entirely inappropriate to bring the President and his wife into this discussion during their visit to New York and I hope my off-the-cuff comment did not cause embarrassment to anyone.&quot; See <a href="#fnref389" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn390">In September 2008 &lt;U+2013&gt; after spending a week avoiding reporters's questions on his ethics issues, by just giving his <a href="Third_Geneva_Convention" title="wikilink">name, rank, and serial number</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; while being interviewed by <a href="Marcia_Kramer" title="wikilink">Marcia Kramer</a> on <a href="WCBS-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WCBS-TV</a>, Rangel said of Governor of Alaska and Republican vice presidential nominee <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a>, &quot;You got to be kind to the disabled.&quot; When Kramer pressed him on whether he really thought she was disabled, Rangel replied, &quot;There's no question about it politically. It's a nightmare to think that a person's foreign policy is based on their ability to look at Russia from where they live.&quot; New York Congressman <a href="Peter_T._King" title="wikilink">Pete King</a> demanded that Rangel apologize, especially given that Palin's five month old son, Trig, suffered from <a href="Down_syndrome" title="wikilink">Down syndrome</a>, saying, &quot;Charlie owes a sincere apology to Sarah Palin and the entire disabled community. All of us know parents who have disabled children or relatives, so from any perspective this was wrong, wrong, wrong.&quot; Carr Massi, the president of <a href="Disabled_in_Action" title="wikilink">Disabled in Action</a>, also criticized Rangel: &quot;I am not one of [Palin's] fans, but I don't like the idea he referred to the woman as disabled. I mean he is talking about her politics &lt;U+2013&gt; that word has no place there.&quot; Rangel suggested later in an interview with the <em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Daily News</a></em> that his comments were aimed at her thin foreign policy background and dismissed suggestions that he was talking about her newborn son as ridiculous. The episode prompted <em><a href="The_Politico" title="wikilink">The Politico</a></em> to declare that &quot;Rangel's off the rails.&quot; See  and <a href="#fnref390" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
