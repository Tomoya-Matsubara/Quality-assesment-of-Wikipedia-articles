<p><strong>Edmund Gerald &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, Sr.</strong> (April 21, 1905 &lt;U+2013&gt; February 16, 1996) was the 32nd <a href="Governor_of_California" title="wikilink">Governor of California</a>, serving from 1959 to 1967, and the father of current Governor of California <a href="Jerry_Brown" title="wikilink">Jerry Brown</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Brown was born in <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco, California</a>, one of four children of Edmund and Ida Schuckman Brown. His father was an <a href="Irish_Catholic" title="wikilink">Irish Catholic</a>, his mother a <a href="German_American" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He acquired the nickname &quot;Pat&quot; during his school years; the nickname was a reference to his <a href="Patrick_Henry" title="wikilink">Patrick Henry</a>-like oratory. When he was 12 and selling <a href="Liberty_Bonds" title="wikilink">Liberty Bonds</a> on street corners, he would end his spiel with, &quot;Give me liberty, or give me death.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He was a debate champion as a member of the <a href="Lowell_Forensic_Society" title="wikilink">Lowell Forensic Society</a> at San Francisco's <a href="Lowell_High_School" title="wikilink">Lowell High School</a>, from which he graduated in 1923. Brown skipped college and worked in his father's cigar store while studying law at a local night school. He graduated from <a href="San_Francisco_Law_School" title="wikilink">San Francisco College of Law</a> in spring 1927, passed the California bar exam the following fall,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and started a law practice in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Brown ran as a Republican for the State Assembly in 1928, but lost; he joined the <a href="United_States_Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> in 1932. He waited until 1939 to seek public office again, this time running for <a href="District_Attorney" title="wikilink">District Attorney</a> of San Francisco, a race he lost to <a href="Matthew_Brady_(district_attorney)" title="wikilink">Matthew Brady</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>He ran again for District Attorney in 1943, and this time won. He served in that position for seven years, and made his name attacking <a href="bookies" class="uri" title="wikilink">bookies</a> and underground <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a> providers. In 1949, he raided <a href="Sally_Stanford" title="wikilink">Sally Stanford</a>'s elegant San Francisco <a href="bordello" class="uri" title="wikilink">bordello</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1946, as the Democratic nominee, Brown lost the race for <a href="California_Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General of California</a> to Los Angeles County District Attorney <a href="Frederick_N._Howser" title="wikilink">Frederick N. Howser</a>. Running again in 1950, he won election as Attorney General and was re-elected in 1954. While he was Attorney General, he was the only Democrat to win statewide election in California.</p>

<p><embed src="William_Knowland,_Edmund_Brown_Newsreel.ogv" title="fig:Newsreel of Attorney General Edmund G. Brown, running unopposed for the 1958 Democratic nomination" width="180" /> In 1958, he was the Democratic nominee for Governor of California. He defeated U.S. Senator <a href="William_F._Knowland" title="wikilink">William F. Knowland</a> by a margin of nearly 20 percentage points and a plurality of over 1 million votes. He was reelected in 1962, defeating former <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> by 52% to 47%. He lost the 1966 election to another future <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a>, <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>. Reagan unseated Brown with 58%, winning a plurality of some 990,000 votes.</p>
<p>Brown's two terms were marked by an enormous water-resources development program. The <a href="California_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">California Aqueduct</a> built as part of the program now bears his name. He also presided over the enactment of the <a href="California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education" title="wikilink">California Master Plan for Higher Education</a>, fair employment legislation, a state economic development commission, and a consumers' council. He sponsored some forty major proposals, only five of which failed to pass in the Legislature.</p>
<p>Brown commuted 23 death sentences (the first time in his second day after taking office)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, including a commutation for <a href="Erwin_Walker" title="wikilink">Erwin &quot;Machine-Gun&quot; Walker</a>. Brown allowed 36 executions, including the highly controversial case of <a href="Caryl_Chessman" title="wikilink">Caryl Chessman</a> in 1960 and <a href="Elizabeth_Duncan" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Duncan</a> - the last female put to death before a national moratorium was instituted.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Brown himself opposed the death penalty<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Chessman case he also proposed that the death penalty be abolished, but the proposal failed.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> His <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> successor, <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>, was a firm death penalty supporter and oversaw the last <a href="Furman_v._Georgia" title="wikilink">pre-Furman</a> execution in California in 1967.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Brown and his wife, Bernice (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Layne), the daughter of a <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> police captain, were childhood sweethearts. They married in 1930 and had four children (all born in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>):</p>

<p>In 1970, Pat's son Jerry Brown was elected Secretary of State of California; in 1974 he was elected as the 34th <a href="Governor_of_California" title="wikilink">Governor of California</a>. Re-elected Governor in 1978, Jerry Brown was defeated in a bid for the <a href="U.S._Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a> in 1982, served as mayor of <a href="Oakland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oakland</a> from 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;2006 and was elected California Attorney General in 2006; he was again elected Governor in 2010. Kathleen Brown was elected <a href="California_State_Treasurer" title="wikilink">California State Treasurer</a> in 1990 and was defeated in a bid for Governor of California in 1994.</p>
<p>In 1958, as Governor-elect, Pat Brown appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;What's My Line?&quot;</p>
<p>Pat Brown died at age 90 in <a href="Beverly_Hills" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills</a> and is interred at <a href="Holy_Cross_Cemetery,_Colma" title="wikilink">Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in <a href="Colma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colma</a>.</p>

<h2 id="presidential-and-vice-presidential-candidate">Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate</h2>
<p>Unlike his son, Jerry, Pat Brown never seriously ran for <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a>, but he frequently was California's &quot;<a href="favorite_son" title="wikilink">favorite son</a>&quot;, running exclusively in his home state.</p>
<p>During the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1952" title="wikilink">1952 Democratic primaries</a> Brown placed distant second to <a href="Estes_Kefauver" title="wikilink">Estes Kefauver</a> in total votes (65.04% to 9.97%),<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> losing California to Kefauver.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>During Governor Brown's first term (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1963), the national census confirmed that California had become the nation's most populous state.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Brown's political popularity, multiplied by the state's population, would contribute to the following two national Presidential victories, when he pledged his votes to the national candidates, (Kennedy in 1960, and Johnson in 1964), at the Democratic conventions.</p>
<p>While Governor, Brown was again California's favorite son <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1960" title="wikilink">in 1960</a>, winning his home state with a large margin to his only opponent <a href="George_H._McLain" title="wikilink">George H. McLain</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Brown joined favorite sons Ohio's <a href="Albert_S._Porter" title="wikilink">Albert S. Porter</a>, <a href="Governor_of_Ohio" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Michael_DiSalle" title="wikilink">Michael DiSalle</a> and <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> Senator <a href="George_Smathers" title="wikilink">George Smathers</a>.</p>
<p>More serious primary candidates were <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, <a href="Hubert_Humphrey" title="wikilink">Hubert Humphrey</a>, <a href="Adlai_Stevenson_II" title="wikilink">Adlai Stevenson II</a> and <a href="Stuart_Symington" title="wikilink">Stuart Symington</a> in 1960, with the nomination going to <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a>. Brown ran only in the California state primary. Yet his popularity with the largest state electorate in the nation gave him second place in the national Democratic primary vote, just behind Kennedy.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thus he repeated his 1952 state and national rankings. However, only one delegate cast his vote for Brown for President at the <a href="1960_Democratic_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1960 Democratic National Convention</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1964" title="wikilink">1964 primaries</a>, by running again only in California, the nation's largest state electorate vote<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> led Brown to place first this time in both the California and the Democratic national primary total,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> besting the eventual nominee. Brown, as well as over a dozen other candidates except <a href="George_Wallace" title="wikilink">George Wallace</a>, was a <a href="stalking_horse" title="wikilink">stalking horse</a> for <a href="incumbent" class="uri" title="wikilink">incumbent</a> <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, whose nomination was assured.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="VPOTUS" title="wikilink">Vice Presidency</a>, he briefly sought nomination at the <a href="1956_Democratic_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1956 Democratic National Convention</a>, winning one vote.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-party-identity-in-california">Political party identity in California</h2>
<p>Prior to 1959, loyalty to a political party was not important in California. Through a practice known as <a href="cross-filing" class="uri" title="wikilink">cross-filing</a>, a person could run in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary at the same time. As indicated in the article on the <a href="California_Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">California Democratic Party</a>, Governor <a href="Earl_Warren" title="wikilink">Earl Warren</a> did so in 1946 and 1950. Cross-filing was abolished in 1959. Thus the fact that Brown first ran for office as a <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> and later as a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> was not, at that time, as significant in California as it would have been elsewhere.</p>
