<p>The Miami area was first inhabited for more than one thousand years by the <a href="Tequesta" title="wikilink">Tequesta Indians</a>, but was later claimed for <a href="Spanish_Empire" title="wikilink">Spain</a> in 1566 by <a href="Pedro_Men&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez_de_Avil&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" title="wikilink">Pedro Men&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez de Avil&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a>. A Spanish <a href="mission_(station)" title="wikilink">mission</a> was constructed one year later in 1567. In 1836, <a href="Fort_Dallas" title="wikilink">Fort Dallas</a> was built, and the Miami area subsequently became a site of fighting during the <a href="Seminole_Wars#Second_Seminole_War" title="wikilink">Second Seminole War</a>.</p>
<p>Miami holds the distinction of being the only major city in the United States founded by a woman, <a href="Julia_Tuttle" title="wikilink">Julia Tuttle</a>, who was a local <a href="citrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">citrus</a> grower and a wealthy <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> native.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Miami area was better known as &quot;Biscayne Bay Country&quot; in the early years of its growth. Some published reports described the area as a promising wilderness.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The area was also characterized as &quot;one of the finest building sites in Florida.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <a href="Great_Freeze" title="wikilink">Great Freeze</a> of 1894-1895 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced <a href="Henry_Flagler" title="wikilink">Henry Flagler</a>, a railroad tycoon, to expand his <a href="Florida_East_Coast_Railroad" title="wikilink">Florida East Coast Railroad</a> to the region. Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure but weakened after the collapse of the <a href="Florida_land_boom_of_the_1920s" title="wikilink">Florida land boom of the 1920s</a>, the <a href="1926_Miami_Hurricane" title="wikilink">1926 Miami Hurricane</a> and the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s. When World War II began, Miami, well-situated due to its location on the southern coast of Florida, played an important role in the battle against <a href="U-boat" title="wikilink">German submarines</a>. The war helped to expand Miami's population; by 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city. After <a href="Fidel_Castro" title="wikilink">Fidel Castro</a> rose to power in 1959, many <a href="Cuba" title="wikilink">Cubans</a> sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the population. In the 1980s and 1990s, various crises struck South Florida, among them the <a href="Arthur_McDuffie" title="wikilink">Arthur McDuffie</a> beating and the subsequent riot, drug wars, <a href="Hurricane_Andrew" title="wikilink">Hurricane Andrew</a>, and the <a href="Eli&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez" title="wikilink">Eli&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez</a> uproar. Nevertheless, in the latter half of the 20th century, Miami became a major international, financial, and cultural center.</p>
<p>Miami and its metropolitan area grew from just over one thousand residents to nearly five and a half million residents in just 110 years (1896-2006). The city's nickname, <em>The Magic City</em>, comes from this rapid growth. Winter visitors remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Miami_Riverwalk.jpg" title="fig:Miami River" alt="Miami River" /> At only  of land area, Miami has the smallest land area of any major U.S. city with a metro area of at least 2.5 million people. The city proper is home to less than 1 in 13 residents of South Florida. Additionally, 52% of Miami-Dade County's population doesn't live in any incorporated city. Miami is the only major city in the United States bordered by two national parks, <a href="Everglades_National_Park" title="wikilink">Everglades National Park</a> on the west, and <a href="Biscayne_National_Park" title="wikilink">Biscayne National Park</a> on the east.</p>
<p>Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the <a href="Florida_Everglades" title="wikilink">Florida Everglades</a> to the west and <a href="Biscayne_Bay" title="wikilink">Biscayne Bay</a> to the east that also extends from <a href="Florida_Bay" title="wikilink">Florida Bay</a> north to <a href="Lake_Okeechobee" title="wikilink">Lake Okeechobee</a>. The elevation of the area never rises above 40 ft (12 m)<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and averages at around 6 ft (2 m)<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> above mean sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest undulations are found along the coastal <a href="Miami_Rock_Ridge" title="wikilink">Miami Rock Ridge</a>, whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created <a href="barrier_island" title="wikilink">barrier islands</a>, the largest of which contains <a href="Miami_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami Beach</a> and <a href="South_Beach" title="wikilink">South Beach</a>. The <a href="Gulf_Stream" title="wikilink">Gulf Stream</a>, a warm <a href="ocean_current" title="wikilink">ocean current</a>, runs northward just 15 miles (24.1 km) off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year.</p>

<p>The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called <em>Miami <a href="oolite" class="uri" title="wikilink">oolite</a></em> or <em>Miami <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a></em>. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent <a href="glaciation" title="wikilink">glaciations</a> or <em><a href="ice_age" title="wikilink">ice ages</a></em>. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the <a href="Eemian_Stage" title="wikilink">Sangamonian Stage</a> raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (7.5 m.) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida <a href="plateau" class="uri" title="wikilink">plateau</a>, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the <a href="Dry_Tortugas" title="wikilink">Dry Tortugas</a>. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of <a href="oolite" title="wikilink">oolites</a> and the shells of <a href="bryozoans" class="uri" title="wikilink">bryozoans</a>. Starting about 100,000 years ago the <a href="Wisconsin_glaciation" title="wikilink">Wisconsin glaciation</a> began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to  below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the <a href="mainland" class="uri" title="wikilink">mainland</a> of South Florida just above sea level.</p>
<p>Beneath the plain lies the <a href="Biscayne_Aquifer" title="wikilink">Biscayne Aquifer</a>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern <a href="Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Palm Beach County</a> to <a href="Florida_Bay" title="wikilink">Florida Bay</a>, with its highest point peaking around the cities of <a href="Miami_Springs,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami Springs</a> and <a href="Hialeah,_Florida" title="wikilink">Hialeah</a>. Most of the <a href="South_Florida_metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">South Florida metropolitan area</a> obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20ft (4.57 to 6.1 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction. For this reason there is no subway system in Miami.</p>
<p>Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the <a href="Everglades" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everglades</a>, a <a href="subtropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtropical</a> <a href="marsh" title="wikilink">marshland</a> located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>. This causes occasional problems with local wildlife such as <a href="American_Alligator" title="wikilink">alligators</a> venturing into Miami communities and major highways.</p>
<p>In terms of land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. According to the <a href="United_States_Census_Bureau" title="wikilink">US Census Bureau</a>, the city encompasses a total area of 55.27 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (143.15 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). Of that area, 35.67 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (92.68 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) is land and 19.59 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (50.73 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) is water. That means Miami comprises over 400,000 people in a mere , making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, along with New York City, San Francisco, and <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> among others.

<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p><img src="Miamisummershower.png" title="fig:Typical summer afternoon shower rolling in from the Everglades." alt="Typical summer afternoon shower rolling in from the Everglades." /> Miami has a true <a href="tropical_climate" title="wikilink">tropical climate</a>, specifically tropical monsoon (<a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen_climate_classification" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification</a> Am),<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> with hot &amp; humid summers and warm &amp; mostly dry winters. The city does experience cold fronts from late October through March. However, the average monthly temperature for any month has never been recorded as being under 64.4 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (January averages 67 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Most of the year is warm and humid, and the summers are almost identical to the climate of the Caribbean tropics. In addition, the city gets most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is mostly dry and mild in winter (dry season). The wet season lasts from May to October, when it gives way to the dry season, which features mild temperatures with some invasions of cool air, which is when the little winter rainfall occurs — with the passing of a front. The <a href="Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">hurricane season</a> largely coincides with the wet season.</p>
<p>In addition to its sea-level <a href="elevation" class="uri" title="wikilink">elevation</a>, coastal location and position just above the <a href="Tropic_of_Cancer" title="wikilink">Tropic of Cancer</a>, the area owes its warm, humid climate to the <a href="Gulf_Stream" title="wikilink">Gulf Stream</a>, which moderates climate year-round. A typical summer day does not have temperatures below 75 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (24 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C). Temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s (30-35 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) accompanied by high humidity are often relieved by afternoon <a href="thunderstorm" title="wikilink">thunderstorms</a> or a <a href="sea_breeze" title="wikilink">sea breeze</a> that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, although conditions still remain very muggy. During winter, humidity is significantly lower, allowing for cooler weather to develop. Average minimum temperatures during that time are around 60 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (15 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C), rarely dipping below 40 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (4 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C), and the equivalent maxima usually range between 70 and 77 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (19-24 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C).</p>
<p>Miami has never recorded a triple-digit <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a>; the highest temperature recorded was .<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The coldest <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> ever recorded in the city of Miami was 30 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (-1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) on several occasions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Miami has only once recorded <a href="snowfall" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowfall</a>, on January 20, 1977. Weather conditions for the area around Miami were recorded sporadically from 1839 until 1900, with many years-long gaps. A cooperative temperature and rainfall recording site was established in what is now Downtown in December, 1900. An official <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">Weather Bureau Office</a> was opened in Miami in June, 1911.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Miami receives abundant rainfall, one of the highest among major U.S. cities. Most of this rainfall occurs from mid-May through early October. It receives annual rainfall of 58.6 inches (1488 mm),<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> whereas nearby <a href="Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida" title="wikilink">Fort Lauderdale</a> and Miami Beach receive 63.8 in (1621 mm) and 48.3 in (1227 mm), respectively, which demonstrates the high local variability in rainfall rates. <a href="Tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">Hurricane season</a> officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the <a href="Cape_Verde-type_hurricane" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a> season which is mid-August through the end of September.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Due to its location between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity, Miami is also statistically the most likely major city in the world to be struck by a hurricane, trailed closely by <a href="Nassau,_Bahamas" title="wikilink">Nassau, Bahamas</a>, and <a href="Havana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Havana</a>, <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>. Despite this, the city has been fortunate in not having a direct hit by a hurricane since <a href="Hurricane_Cleo" title="wikilink">Hurricane Cleo</a> in 1964.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, many other hurricanes have affected the city, including <a href="Hurricane_Betsy" title="wikilink">Betsy</a> in 1965, <a href="Hurricane_Andrew" title="wikilink">Andrew</a> in 1992, <a href="Hurricane_Irene_(1999)" title="wikilink">Irene</a> in 1999, and Hurricanes <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Katrina</a> and <a href="Hurricane_Wilma" title="wikilink">Wilma</a> in 2005. In addition, a tropical depression in October 2000 passed over the city, causing record rainfall and flooding. Locally, the storm is credited as the <a href="Tropical_Storm_Leslie_(2000)" title="wikilink">No Name Storm of 2000</a>, though the depression went on to become Tropical Storm Leslie upon entering the Atlantic Ocean. Miami has been identified as one of three cities in the United States most vulnerable to hurricanes, mainly due to its location and it being surrounded by ocean and low-lying <a href="coastal_plain" title="wikilink">coastal plains</a>, the other two cities being <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> and New York City.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
