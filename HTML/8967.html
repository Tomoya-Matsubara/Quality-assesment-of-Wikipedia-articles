<p><strong>Hurricane Hiki</strong> was the <a href="List_of_wettest_tropical_cyclones_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">wettest</a> <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> on record in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. It was also considered the first official hurricane in the vicinity of the <a href="Hawaiian_Islands" title="wikilink">Hawaiian Islands</a>. The fourth <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="1950_Pacific_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1950 Pacific hurricane season</a>, Hiki formed as a tropical depression to the southeast of <a href="Hawaii_(island)" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a> on August 12. On the following day, the depression headed northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hiki. While paralleling the Hawaiian Islands on August 16, Hiki strengthened into a hurricane. Around that time, the storm peaked with <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of 85 mph (140 km/h). The following day, Hiki curved southwestward on August 17. Two days later, the hurricane resumed moving northwestward and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Around midday on August 21, Hiki weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated about six hours later.</p>
<p>Although Hiki was a small tropical cyclone and bypassed Hawaii, heavy rainfall and strong winds were observed throughout the islands. At the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station on <a href="Kauai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>,  of precipitation was observed, which was the highest total associated with a tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The <a href="Waimea_River_(Hawaii)" title="wikilink">Waimea River</a> overflowed, causing more than 200 residents to flee their homes. Many streets and several hundred acres of sugar cane fields were flooded. About $200,000 (1950 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>) in damage was reported due to flooding in the city of Waimea. In <a href="Kekaha,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kekaha</a>, the powerhouse suffered severe damage. Throughout the islands, winds de-roofed several homes and downed power lines; one fatality occurred after a person came in contact with a <a href="Live_wire_(electricity)" title="wikilink">live wire</a>.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>
<p>According to ship reports during the summer, the <a href="Intertropical_Convergence_Zone" title="wikilink">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a> was farther north than usual, which created favorable conditions for <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">tropical cyclogenesis</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Weather charts at the <a href="Honolulu_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Honolulu International Airport</a>, a tropical depression developed at 00:00 <a href="Coordinated_Universal_Time" title="wikilink">UTC</a> on August 12, while located about  southeast of the <a href="Hawaii_(island)" title="wikilink">Big Island</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thereafter, the storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on August 13. It was named <em>Hiki</em>, which is <a href="Hawaiian_language" title="wikilink">Hawaiian</a> for <em>Able</em>. While situated east of <a href="Hilo,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Hilo, Hawaii</a>, the system was described as an &quot;immature storm&quot;, and had a very small diameter. Shortly thereafter, a <a href="reconnaissance_aircraft" title="wikilink">reconnaissance aircraft</a> flew into Hiki and estimated that sustained wind speeds between 50 and 60 mph (80 and 100 km/h). Further intensification continued and the system strengthened into a hurricane on August 16.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Upon reaching hurricane intensity on August 16, Hiki simultaneously attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 85 mph (140 km/h). Despite this, the storm had remained small, with gale force winds extending less than  from the center. Hiki remained between 100 and 200 mi (160 and 320 km) offshore while paralleling several Hawaiian Islands, including Hawaii, <a href="Maui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maui</a>, <a href="Molokai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Molokai</a>, <a href="Oahu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oahu</a>, and <a href="Kauai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>As a <a href="High-pressure_area" title="wikilink">high pressure</a> <a href="Ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> intensified, the northwestward movement of Hiki was blocked, causing the storm to briefly turn due west on August 17. The high pressure ridge eventually influenced the hurricane to re-curve southwestward. On August 18, a reconnaissance aircraft observed sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) to the south of the center; a minimum <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of  was also observed. After the reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on August 18, residents of Kauai and Oahu were alerted of a possible cyclonic loop. However, later that day, the high pressure ridge weakened, causing Hiki to turned westward and pass south of <a href="French_Frigate_Shoals" title="wikilink">French Frigate Shoals</a> and <a href="Midway_Island" title="wikilink">Midway Island</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Late on August 19, Hiki weakened to a tropical storm and then resumed its course to the northwest. By August 21, Hiki further weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated six hours later.</p>
<h2 id="preparations-and-impact">Preparations and impact</h2>

<p>Hiki was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to approach the Hawaiian Islands in at least 45 years and officially the first hurricane in the region.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> As Hiki approached, a <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> station with 14 people in <a href="French_Frigate_Shoals" title="wikilink">French Frigate Shoals</a> was alerted. In addition, ships in the area were also advised to take caution. Hiki caused high waves on some of the Hawaiian Islands.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Hawaii remained on the southern semicircle of Hiki, and as a result, light wind damage occurred. The highest reported winds from Hiki was at the <a href="Kilauea_Light" title="wikilink">Kilauea Lighthouse</a> on <a href="Kauai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>, where gusts up to  were observed. The islands of <a href="Niihau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Niihau</a> and <a href="Lanai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lanai</a> also experienced tropical storm force winds, reaching 48 and 50 mph (77 and 80 km/h), respectively. As a result, several houses throughout the Hawaiian Islands lost their roof. In addition, a farmer in <a href="Kohala,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kohala</a> on Hawaii died after coming into contact with a live wire that was blown down from high winds.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Hiki was the wettest tropical cyclone in United States history, as rainfall of over  observed at the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station on Kauai between August 14 and August 18.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The rain gauge was capable of holding  of the rain and was emptied on August 15. However, less than 24 hours later, the same rain gauge was overflowing. Heavy precipitation was also recorded on other locations on that island, including  on <a href="Mount_Waialeale" title="wikilink">Mount Waialeale</a>. Few reports exist on rainfall totals on other Hawaiian Islands, with the only other island recording rainfall was <a href="Maui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maui</a>, with precipitation reaching  on August 15. This was the highest 24 hour record for that island in the month of August.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> On Kauai, the <a href="Waimea_River_(Hawaii)" title="wikilink">Waimea River</a> experienced one of the worst flood in its history, causing more than 200 residents in <a href="Waimea_Valley" title="wikilink">Waimea Valley</a> to evacuate. The river also rose near the mouth of its tributary, the Makaweli River, flooding the town of Waimea, causing about $200,000 in damage.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The streets on the island and hundreds of acres of <a href="Sugarcane" title="wikilink">sugar cane</a> were flooded. Additionally, severe damage was reported at the <a href="Kekaha,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kekaha</a> Powerhouse.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
