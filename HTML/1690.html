<p><img src="Bottomley-trafalgar-square.jpg" title="fig:Horatio Bottomley addressing a wartime public meeting in Trafalgar Square" alt="Horatio Bottomley addressing a wartime public meeting in Trafalgar Square" /> <strong>Horatio William Bottomley</strong> (23 March 1860Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 26 May 1933) was a British financier, swindler, journalist, editor, newspaper proprietor, and <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a>. He is best known for his editorship of the popular magazine <em><a href="John_Bull_(magazine)" title="wikilink">John Bull</a></em>, and for his patriotic oratory during the First World War. His career came to a sudden end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.</p>
<p>Bottomley spent five years in an orphanage before beginning his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in a number of court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers including, in 1886, the <em><a href="Financial_Times" title="wikilink">Financial Times</a></em>. He overreached himself with an ambitious <a href="Initial_public_offering" title="wikilink">public flotation</a> of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.</p>
<p>In 1906 Bottomley entered parliament as <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> member for <a href="Hackney_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Hackney South</a>. In the same year he founded the popular magazine <em>John Bull</em>, which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.</p>
<p>In 1918, having been discharged from bankruptcy, Bottomley re-entered parliament as an Independent member. In the following year he launched his fraudulent &quot;Victory Bonds&quot; scheme which, when exposed, led to his conviction, imprisonment and expulsion from parliament. Released in 1927, he attempted unsuccessfully to relaunch his business career, and eked a living by lecturing and appearances in music halls. His final years before his death in 1933 were spent in poverty.</p>

<p>William Bottomley died in 1864 and Elizabeth a year later. Horatio and his elder sister, Florence, were initially looked after by their uncle William Holyoake, an artist living in the London district of <a href="Marylebone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marylebone</a>. After a year they were boarded out to foster-parents, at their uncle George Jacob's expense. This arrangement lasted until 1869, when Florence was formally adopted by her foster-family. At this point Holyoake felt unable to continue supporting Horatio financially, and arranged for him to be admitted to <a href="Josiah_Mason" title="wikilink">Josiah Mason</a>'s orphanage in <a href="Erdington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erdington</a>, <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This was Horatio's home for the following five years. Some biographers have emphasised the cruelty and humiliation of his time there;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> however, while discipline was certainly harsh, Horatio received a useful basic education, and won prizes for sporting activities. In later life he showed no resentment towards the institution, which he often visited, telling the children that &quot;any success I have achieved in life started at this place.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due to leave the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill&lt;U+2014&gt;his mother's sister&lt;U+2014&gt;who lived in nearby <a href="Edgbaston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edgbaston</a>, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham building firm. This arrangement lasted only a few months before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<h4 id="first-steps">First steps</h4>
<p>Bottomley soon gave up his apprenticeship, and after a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City</a> firm of <a href="solicitors" class="uri" title="wikilink">solicitors</a>. Here he picked up a working knowledge of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href="Thomas_Henry_Huxley" title="wikilink">Thomas Huxley</a> and <a href="John_Stuart_Mill" title="wikilink">John Stuart Mill</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the daughter of a debt collector. Bottomley's biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the same year, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole's, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be much in evidence in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer <a href="Julian_Symons" title="wikilink">Julian Symons</a>, could &quot;tempt the banknotes out of men's pockets&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="publishing-entrepreneur">Publishing entrepreneur</h4>
<p>Bottomley's association with Bradlaugh had awakened his interests in publishing and politics, and in 1884 he launched his first entrepreneurial venture, a magazine called the <em>Hackney Hansard</em>. This journal recorded the business of Hackney's local &quot;parliament&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;essentially a debating society that mirrored the proceedings at Westminster. Advertisements from local tradesmen kept the paper mildly profitable. Bottomley produced a sister-paper, the <em>Battersea Hansard</em>, covering that borough's local parliament, before merging the two into <em>The Debater</em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1885 he formed the Catherine Street Publishing Association and, using borrowed capital, acquired or started several magazines and papers. These included, among others, the <em>Municipal Review</em>, a prestigious local government publication; <em>Youth</em>, a boy's paper on which <a href="Alfred_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Northcliffe" title="wikilink">Alfred Harmondsworth</a>, the future press magnate Lord Northcliffe, worked as a sub-editor; and the <em><a href="Financial_Times" title="wikilink">Financial Times</a></em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The last-named was set up to rival the <em><a href="Financial_News" title="wikilink">Financial News</a></em>, London's first specialist business paper, which had been started in 1884 by Harry Marks, a former sewing-machine salesman.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1886 Bottomley's company acquired its own printing works through a merger with the printing firm of MacRae and Co., and after the absorption of another advertising and printing firm, became MacRae, Curtice and Company.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of 26, Bottomley became the company's chairman.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His advance in the business world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> in <a href="Hornsey_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Hornsey</a> to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from <a href="William_Gladstone" title="wikilink">William Gladstone</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the &quot;Quixotic impulse&quot; that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: &quot;He was a printer, and I was a journalist&lt;U+2014&gt;but he took the papers and left me the printing works&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="hansard-publishing-union">Hansard Publishing Union</h4>
<p><img src="Sir_henry_hawkins.jpg" title="fig:Sir Henry Hawkins, the judge before whom Bottomley appeared, and was acquitted, on fraud charges in 1893" alt="Sir Henry Hawkins, the judge before whom Bottomley appeared, and was acquitted, on fraud charges in 1893" /> Undismayed by the loss of his papers, Bottomley embarked on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the <a href="Hansard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hansard</a> reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, <a href="Initial_public_offering" title="wikilink">floated</a> on the <a href="London_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">London Stock Exchange</a> with a capital of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor-elect of London</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London <em><a href="The_Evening_News_(London_newspaper)" title="wikilink">Evening News</a></em>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and <a href="Roper_Lethbridge" title="wikilink">Sir Roper Lethbridge</a>, the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> MP for <a href="Kensington_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Kensington North</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses&lt;U+2014&gt;he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He also persuaded the board to give him &lt;U+00A3&gt;75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of &lt;U+00A3&gt;40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The funds for the dividend payment were raised by a <a href="debenture" class="uri" title="wikilink">debenture</a> of &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it &quot;Bottomley's swindle&quot;. Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 from the company, filed a petition for <a href="Bankruptcy_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">bankruptcy</a>. Under examination by the <a href="Official_Receiver" title="wikilink">Official Receiver</a>, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the <a href="Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">Board of Trade</a> instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The trial began in the <a href="High_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">High Court of Justice</a> on 30 January 1893, before <a href="Henry_Hawkins,_1st_Baron_Brampton" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Hawkins</a>; Bottomley conducted his own defence.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for far less than the prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="company-promoter-newspaper-proprietor-would-be-politician">Company promoter, newspaper proprietor, would-be politician</h3>
<p>The Hansard Union case, far from damaging Bottomley's reputation, had left a general impression that he was a financial genius.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He avoided the stigma of bankruptcy by arranging a scheme of repayment with his creditors,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and swiftly embarked on a new career promoting Western Australian gold mining shares.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The discovery of gold in <a href="Kalgoorlie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalgoorlie</a> and adjoining areas in the early 1890s had created an easily exploitable investment boom; as Bottomley's biographer Alan Hyman observes, &quot;A hole in the groundÂ ... could be boosted into a very promising gold-mine, and investors only found that they had backed a loser after the mine had been floated as a public company and they had paid hard cash for their shares&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> By 1897, through skilful exploitation of demand and by frequent reconstruction of failing companies, Bottomley had accumulated a considerable personal fortune. It was, the historian <a href="A._J._A._Morris" title="wikilink">A.J.A. Morris</a> asserts, &quot;a truly amazing success story, the product of reckless audacity, astonishing energy, and extreme good fortune&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Bottomley won plaudits when he announced that he would pay &lt;U+00A3&gt;250,000 to the creditors of the Hansard Union; the bulk of this payment, however, was offered in shares in one or other of his mining promotions.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <img src="St_Bedes_UpperDicker.jpg" title="fig:Bottomley&#39;s country home, &quot;The Dicker&quot;, photographed in 2010.

It forms part of St Bede&#39;s School." /> As his wealth increased, Bottomley adopted an increasingly ostentatious lifestyle. In London he lived in a luxurious apartment in <a href="Pall_Mall,_London" title="wikilink">Pall Mall</a>. He took numerous mistresses, whom he visited in a number of discreet flats in different districts of London.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He owned several racehorses, who achieved prestigious victories&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Stewards&#39;_Cup_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">Stewards' Cup</a> at <a href="Goodwood_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Goodwood</a>, and the <a href="Cesarewitch_Handicap" title="wikilink">Cesarewitch</a> at <a href="Newmarket_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Newmarket</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;but he often lost large sums through unwise bets.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Quite early in his rise to wealth he bought a modest property in <a href="Upper_Dicker" title="wikilink">Upper Dicker</a>, near <a href="Eastbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eastbourne</a> in <a href="East_Sussex" title="wikilink">East Sussex</a>. He called it &quot;The Dicker&quot;, and over the years extended and developed it into a large country mansion, where he entertained extravagantly.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Bottomley had retained his parliamentary ambitions and in 1890, before the Hansard Union crash, had been adopted as the Liberal candidate for <a href="Islington_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">North Islington</a>. According to Symons, when he resigned the candidature on the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, he had the constituency in his pocket.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> By 1900 his star was again in the ascendant, and he was invited by the <a href="Hackney_South_and_Shoreditch_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">South Hackney</a> Liberals to be their candidate in that year's <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1900" title="wikilink">general election</a>. He lost by only 280 votes, after a bitterly fought campaign in which Bottomley was described in a newspaper article as a &quot;bare-faced swindlerÂ ... [whose]Â ... place is at the Old Bailey, not at Westminster&quot;. He was subsequently awarded &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 libel damages against the writer, Henry Hess.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>By the turn of the 19th&lt;U+2013&gt;20th centuries the boom in speculative shares had abated; some of Bottomley's fellow promoters, such as <a href="Whitaker_Wright" title="wikilink">Whitaker Wright</a>, were facing charges of fraud and misrepresentation.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Bottomley ceased his operations, and resumed his earlier role of newspaper proprietor.

<p>In the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1906" title="wikilink">general election of January 1906</a> Bottomley was again the Liberal candidate for Hackney South.

<p>Alongside his parliamentary duties, Bottomley was engaged in launching his biggest and boldest publishing venture, the weekly news magazine <em><a href="John_Bull_(magazine)" title="wikilink">John Bull</a></em>, half of the initial capital for which was provided by Hooley.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> From its first issue on 12 May 1906 <em>John Bull</em> adopted a <a href="Tabloid_journalism" title="wikilink">tabloid</a> style that, despite occasional lapses in taste, proved immensely popular.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Among its regular features, Bottomley revived his &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; column from <em>The Sun</em>, and also adapted that paper's slogan: &quot;If you read it in John Bull, it is so&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Bottomley persuaded <a href="Julius_Elias,_1st_Viscount_Southwood" title="wikilink">Julius Elias</a>, managing director of <a href="Odhams_Press" title="wikilink">Odhams Limited</a>, to handle the printing, but chaotic financial management meant that Odhams were rarely paid.

Circulation rose rapidly, and by 1910 had reached half a million copies.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1906 Bottomley announced the John Bull Investment Trust, in which, for a minimum subscription of &lt;U+00A3&gt;10, investors could share &quot;that special and exclusive information which is obtainable only as the result of extensive City experience&quot;.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> However, Bottomley's earlier City activities were coming under scrutiny, particularly the multiple reconstructions of his now-bankrupt Joint Stock Trust Company. After a long investigation, which Bottomley did all he could to frustrate, in December 1908 he was summoned to appear at the <a href="Guildhall,_London" title="wikilink">Guildhall Justice Room</a>, before a court of aldermen.{{#tag:ref|Under English law, the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the City of London were empowered to act as magistrates.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> | group=n}} As with the Hansard prosecution, the case against Bottomley appeared overwhelming; share issues in the Joint Stock Trust had been repeatedly re-issued, perhaps as many as six times.

When Britain declared war on the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a> on 4 August, Bottomley quickly reversed his position, and within a fortnight was demanding the elimination of Germany. <em>John Bull</em> campaigned relentlessly against the &quot;Germhuns&quot;, and against British citizens carrying German-sounding surnames&lt;U+2014&gt;the danger of &quot;the enemy within&quot; was a persistent Bottomley theme.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> On 14 September 1914 he addressed a large crowd at the <a href="Peacock_Theatre" title="wikilink">London Opera House</a>, the first of many mass meetings at which he deployed his trademark phrase, &quot;the Prince of Peace, pointing to the Star of Bethlehem that leads us on to God&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;words which according to Symons moved many hearts.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> At the &quot;Great War Rally&quot; at the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a> on 14 January 1915, Bottomley was fully in tune with the national temper when he proclaimed: &quot;We are fighting all that is worst in the world, the product of a debased civilisation&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the government was wary of Bottomley it was prepared to make use of his influence and popularity.

<p>Although in 1912 Bottomley had expressed contempt for parliament, he privately hankered to return.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> When the war ended in November 1918 and a general election was announced, he knew that to be a candidate in that election he needed a discharge from his bankruptcy.

<p>After the dismissal of his appeal in July, Bottomley was expelled from the House of Commons. The <a href="Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">Leader of the House</a>, <a href="Sir_Austen_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Sir Austen Chamberlain</a>, read out a letter in which Bottomley insisted that, however unorthodox his methods, he had not been guilty of conscious fraud; he accepted, however, that his predicament was entirely his own fault. Chamberlain then moved Bottomley's expulsion, which was carried without dissent. One member expressed regret, &quot;remembering the remarkable position which he [had] occupied in the country&quot;.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Bottomley spent the first year of his sentence in <a href="Wormwood_Scrubs" title="wikilink">Wormwood Scrubs</a> where he sewed mailbags,{{#tag:ref|Bottomley's stint sewing mailbags is the source of what Symons terms the best-known of all Bottomley stories. A visitor, variously described as a Home Office inspector, a personal friend, a prison chaplain, etc., observed him at work, and remarked &quot;Ah, Bottomley, sewing?&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; to which he replied at once: &quot;No, reaping&quot;. Symons believes that &quot;in spite of its apocryphal sound&quot;, the story is essentially true, and illustrates Bottomley's wit and resilience.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a>| group=n}} and the remainder in <a href="HM_Prison_Maidstone" title="wikilink">Maidstone prison</a> where, although conditions were squalid, he was given lighter work.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> He was released on 29 July 1927, after serving just over five years, and returned to The Dicker, still his family home.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a><a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Although now 67 years old and in indifferent health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital to start a new magazine, <em>John Blunt</em>, as a rival to <em>John Bull</em>, but the new venture lasted little more than a year before closing, having lost money from the start.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In 1979 The Dicker was acquired by <a href="St_Bede&#39;s_School,_Sussex" title="wikilink">St Bede's School</a> to house the newly established St Bede's Senior School.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> | group=n}} For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>Bottomley's last public venture was an engagement at the <a href="Windmill_Theatre" title="wikilink">Windmill Theatre</a> in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Following a health breakdown, he lived with Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the <a href="Middlesex_Hospital" title="wikilink">Middlesex Hospital</a> on 26 May, and was cremated at <a href="Golders_Green_Crematorium" title="wikilink">Golders Green Crematorium</a> a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that &quot;no one here today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered the ashes on the <a href="South_Downs" title="wikilink">Sussex Downs</a>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="appraisal">Appraisal</h2>

<p>Bottomley's obituaries dwelt on the common theme of wasted talent: a man of brilliant natural abilities, destroyed by greed and vanity. &quot;He had personal magnetism, eloquence, and the power to convince&quot;, wrote his <em><a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a></em> obituarist. &quot;He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Straits_Times" title="wikilink">The Straits Times</a></em> of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: &quot;Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he did when he was Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog&quot;.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> A later historian, <a href="Maurice_Cowling" title="wikilink">Maurice Cowling</a>, pays tribute to Bottomley's capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> In his sketch for the <em><a href="Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography" title="wikilink">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a></em>, Morris delivers a different judgement: &quot;[H]e claimed to serve the interests of others, but sought only his own gratification&quot;.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>Among Bottomley's principal biographers, Hyman suggests that his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of wealth in the 1890s. &quot;Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit.&quot; It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison as long as he did.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Symons acknowledges Bottomley's &quot;wonderfully rich public personality&quot; but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was &quot;more a series of public attitudes than a person&quot;.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> <a href="Matthew_Engel" title="wikilink">Matthew Engel</a> in <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of &lt;U+00A3&gt;40,000, apparently insisted: &quot;I am not sorry I lent him the money, and I would do it again&quot;. If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p>Bottomley was the subject of an episode in the 1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73 BBC television series <em>The Edwardians</em>, transmitted on 28 November 1972. The part of Bottomley was played by <a href="Timothy_West" title="wikilink">Timothy West</a>, with Mitzi Rogers as Peggy Primrose and <a href="John_Welsh_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Welsh</a> as Mr Justice Hawkins.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
