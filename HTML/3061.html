<p>The <strong>1987 Atlantic hurricane season</strong> was an average <a href="List_of_Atlantic_hurricane_seasons" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane season</a> that was limited by an ongoing <a href="El_Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o" title="wikilink">El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o</a>. The first tropical depression of the season developed on <a href="May_25" title="wikilink">May 25</a>, prior to the official start of the season on <a href="June_1" title="wikilink">June 1</a>; the last cyclone dissipated on <a href="November_14" title="wikilink">November 14</a>. The season marked the first year <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">tropical storm watches and warnings</a> were issued; previously, gale watches and warnings were used for tropical storms.</p>
<p>With fourteen tropical cyclones, of which seven attained tropical storm status, the season was relatively quiet, and was somewhat unusual in that there were no United States deaths.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Hurricane_Emily_(1987)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Emily</a> was the deadliest and most notable storm of the season, causing $65 million in damage (1987 USD) as it ravaged the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a> and <a href="Bermuda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bermuda</a>. __TOC__</p>

<p>Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. <a href="William_M._Gray" title="wikilink">William M. Gray</a>, and his associates at <a href="Colorado_State_University" title="wikilink">Colorado State University</a>. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 named storms, with 4 to 8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 major hurricanes. The <a href="June_2" title="wikilink">June 2</a>, <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> report suggested that eight tropical storms would form during the 1987 season, five of them becoming hurricanes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, the forecasts proved too high, as only seven tropical storms formed, three of them hurricanes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1987 Atlantic hurricane season had 14 tropical depressions form from <a href="May_25" title="wikilink">May 25</a> to <a href="November_5" title="wikilink">November 5</a>. Seven of the depressions strengthened into tropical storms, six of them named.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (Tropical Depression Two was upgraded into a tropical storm in post-season analysis, and has no name.) Tropical Storms Arlene, Emily and Floyd all reached hurricane status during their period.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Only one of the three, Emily, reached major hurricane status. Tropical Depression Fourteen may have been a tropical storm in its lifetime, but it remains a tropical depression.</p>
<p>The United States only got affected by four tropical systems this year, Tropical Depression One, which hit <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, the unnamed storm which hit the <a href="Gulf_Coast" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast</a>, while Hurricane Floyd and Tropical Depression Fourteen struck <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> as well.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The second tropical depression of the season formed in the northwestern <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> from a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> on <a href="August_9" title="wikilink">August 9</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It quickly strengthened into a <a href="tropical_storm" title="wikilink">tropical storm</a>, though the strengthening was not known at the time. Based on lack of significant organization or reports at the time, the storm remained unnamed. It traveled northwestward and as it neared the coast, the first tropical storm warning ever issued for a tropical system was issued for the <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> and Louisiana coasts from <a href="Galveston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Galveston</a> to <a href="Lake_Charles,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Lake Charles</a>. The tropical storm made landfall near <a href="High_Island,_Texas" title="wikilink">High Island, Texas</a> on the 10th, and quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved northeastward.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It turned to the southeast, reached the Gulf of Mexico, accelerated to the northeast, and dissipated over <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> on the 17th.

<h3 id="hurricane-arlene">Hurricane Arlene</h3>

<p>A low pressure system on the tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a <a href="subtropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtropical</a> depression on <a href="August_8" title="wikilink">August 8</a> near the <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> coast, and drifted southward.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Convection organized more, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on <a href="August_10" title="wikilink">August 10</a> over the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on <a href="August_11" title="wikilink">August 11</a>, based on reports from <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a>. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A <a href="trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> of low pressure near <a href="Bermuda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bermuda</a> initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on <a href="August_22" title="wikilink">August 22</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye feature</a> on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and on <a href="August_23" title="wikilink">August 23</a> it became <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> about halfway between <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> and <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the <a href="Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberian Peninsula</a> before dissipating on <a href="August_28" title="wikilink">August 28</a> over <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>A well-organized tropical disturbance formed off the <a href="African" class="uri" title="wikilink">African</a> coast on <a href="August_17" title="wikilink">August 17</a> and became a tropical depression the following day, as classified by satellite imagery.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Later the same day, the ship S.S.

<p>The cyclone moved a westward course of 20 -  and reached its peak intensity of 50 <a href="mph" class="uri" title="wikilink">mph</a> and 1000 <a href="millibars" class="uri" title="wikilink">millibars</a> on <a href="August_20" title="wikilink">August 20</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> A ridge of high pressure in the eastern <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, north of Bret, began to weaken and drift to the east on the 20th. The storm was moving at  to the east on <a href="August_21" title="wikilink">August 21</a>. It was thought that Bret would strengthen at this point.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Bret slowed from <a href="August_21" title="wikilink">August 21</a> until <a href="August_23" title="wikilink">August 23</a>, moving at only 15 - 20 <a href="mph" class="uri" title="wikilink">mph</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The cyclone soon moved on a northwestward course and encountered wind shear. Bret weakened into a depression on <a href="August_23" title="wikilink">August 23</a>, due to the wind shear over the system. The next morning, the depression became a tropical wave with no low-level circulation left. The wave was soon absorbed by a trough of low pressure during the next few days.

Cindy continued northward, and peaked at  winds on the 8th before turning to the northeast. Strong upper-level shear weakened the storm, and after two days of struggling as a tropical storm, Cindy became <a href="extratropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> on the 10th to the northwest of the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

Convection organized around a low pressure area east of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, and it was declared Tropical Depression Nine on <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a>. Initially poorly organized,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> the depression moved generally northward without strengthening, and quickly made landfall along the coast of <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>.

<p>A broad area of low pressure organized into a tropical depression off the coast of <a href="Nicaragua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a> on <a href="October_9" title="wikilink">October 9</a>. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on <a href="October_10" title="wikilink">October 10</a>. After crossing western <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on <a href="October_12" title="wikilink">October 12</a>. It passed through the <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Florida Keys</a> before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on <a href="October_13" title="wikilink">October 13</a> to the southeast of <a href="Miami,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami</a>; the storm crossed the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, and becoming an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on <a href="October_14" title="wikilink">October 14</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Damage in Florida was minimal, due to the disorganized nature of the hurricane. Floyd brought up to 10.07 inches to the state, causing moderate crop damage in the southern portion of the state.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In addition, a tornado spawned by the storm damaged portions of the Florida Keys. Overall damage amounted to around $500,000 (1987 <a href="USD" class="uri" title="wikilink">USD</a>), with no casualties or injuries reported.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tropical-depression-fourteen">Tropical Depression Fourteen</h3>



<p>A broad area of low pressure existed in the central <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a> in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on <a href="October_31" title="wikilink">October 31</a>. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a>, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Florida Keys</a> as it passed through the area on the 2nd.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> west coast, and lost all of its convection on the 3rd. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak <a href="extratropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> low over northern Florida on the 4th.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>While passing to the west of <a href="Jamaica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaica</a>, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, with a three-day peak of 10.21 <a href="inches" class="uri" title="wikilink">inches</a> (25.93 <a href="millimeter" title="wikilink">mm</a> at <a href="Kingston,_Jamaica" title="wikilink">Kingston</a>, and a peak daily rainfall total of 6.38 inches (16.21 mm) on <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> According to an unofficial report, the flooding caused six fatalities in Jamaica.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> reported moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.75 inches (12.07 mm) in <a href="Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Honda,_Cuba" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Honda</a> the province of <a href="Pinar_del_R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_Province" title="wikilink">Pinar del R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Despite being a weak system, the depression also dropped moderate precipitation across <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, peaking at 10.23 inches (26 mm) at <a href="Loxahatchee_National_Wildlife_Refuge" title="wikilink">Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Rainfall was experienced as far north as eastern <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> and extreme southern <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>The table on the right shows the <a href="Accumulated_Cyclone_Energy" title="wikilink">ACE</a> for each storm in the season. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. </p>
