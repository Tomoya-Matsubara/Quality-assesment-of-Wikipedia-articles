<p><strong>Carl Linnaeus</strong> (Swedish original name <strong>Carl Nilsson Linn&lt;U+00E6&gt;us</strong>, 23 May<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> 1707 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 January 1778), also known after his <a href="Swedish_nobility" title="wikilink">ennoblement</a> as ,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> was a Swedish <a href="botanist" class="uri" title="wikilink">botanist</a>, <a href="physician" class="uri" title="wikilink">physician</a>, and <a href="zoologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">zoologist</a>, who laid the foundations for the modern scheme of <a href="binomial_nomenclature" title="wikilink">binomial nomenclature</a>. He is known as the father of modern <a href="alpha_taxonomy" title="wikilink">taxonomy</a>, and is also considered one of the fathers of modern <a href="ecology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecology</a>. Many of his writings were in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, and his name is rendered in Latin as <strong></strong> (after 1761 <strong>Carolus a Linn&lt;U+00E9&gt;</strong>).</p>
<p>Linnaeus was born in the countryside of <a href="Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land</a>, in southern Sweden. Linnaeus received most of his higher education at <a href="Uppsala_University" title="wikilink">Uppsala University</a>, and began giving lectures in <a href="botany" class="uri" title="wikilink">botany</a> there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his <em></em> in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of botany at <a href="Uppsala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uppsala</a>. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.</p>
<p>The Swiss philosopher <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> sent him the message: &quot;Tell him I know no greater man on earth.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The German writer <a href="Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="wikilink">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> wrote: &quot;With the exception of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a> and <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Spinoza</a>, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Swedish author <a href="August_Strindberg" title="wikilink">August Strindberg</a> wrote: &quot;Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called <em></em> (Prince of Botanists), &quot;The <a href="Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="wikilink">Pliny</a> of the North,&quot; and &quot;The Second <a href="Adam#Creation" title="wikilink">Adam</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Carl Linnaeus was born in the village of <a href="R&lt;U+00E5&gt;shult" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00E5&gt;shult</a> in <a href="Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land</a>, Sweden on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus and Christina Brodersonia. His father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent <a href="surname" class="uri" title="wikilink">surname</a>. Before that, ancestors had used the <a href="patronymic" class="uri" title="wikilink">patronymic</a> naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the <a href="University_of_Lund" title="wikilink">University of Lund</a>, he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linn&lt;U+00E6&gt;us after a giant <a href="linden_tree" title="wikilink">linden tree</a> (or lime tree), <em></em> in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This name was spelled with the <a href="&lt;U+00E6&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E6&gt;</a> <a href="Typographic_ligature" title="wikilink">ligature</a>. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linn&lt;U+00E6&gt;us, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the &lt;U+00E6&gt; ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linn&lt;U+00E6&gt;us.</p>
<p>One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur <a href="botanist" class="uri" title="wikilink">botanist</a>, a <a href="Lutheran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a> <a href="minister_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">minister</a>, and the <a href="curate" class="uri" title="wikilink">curate</a> of the small village of Stenbrohult in Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land. Christina was the daughter of the <a href="rector_general" title="wikilink">rector</a> of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. She subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son, Samuel (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on <a href="beekeeping" class="uri" title="wikilink">beekeeping</a>).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A year after Linnaeus' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the <a href="rectory" class="uri" title="wikilink">rectory</a> from the curate's house.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="early-education">Early education</h4>
<p>His father began teaching Linnaeus Latin, religion, and geography at an early age; one account says that due to family use of Latin for conversation, the boy learned Latin before he learned Swedish. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local <a href="yeoman" class="uri" title="wikilink">yeoman</a>. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander &quot;was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower <a href="Grammar_School" title="wikilink">Grammar School</a> at <a href="V&lt;U+00E4&gt;xj&lt;U+00F6&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00E4&gt;xj&lt;U+00F6&gt;</a> in 1717.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land and a teacher at V&lt;U+00E4&gt;xj&lt;U+00F6&gt; <a href="Gymnasium_(school)" title="wikilink">Gymnasium</a>. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in <a href="medicine" class="uri" title="wikilink">medicine</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Linnaeus entered the V&lt;U+00E4&gt;xj&lt;U+00F6&gt; Gymnasium in 1724, where he studied mainly <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, <a href="Hebrew" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>, <a href="theology" class="uri" title="wikilink">theology</a> and <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in V&lt;U+00E4&gt;xj&lt;U+00F6&gt; and to teach him <a href="physiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">physiology</a> and botany. Nils accepted this offer.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to <a href="Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort" title="wikilink">Tournefort's</a> system. Linnaeus was also taught about sexuality of plants, according to <a href="S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien_Vaillant" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Vaillant</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in <a href="Lund_University" title="wikilink">Lund University</a> in <a href="Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He was registered as <em></em>, the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The local doctor Kilian Stobaeus offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne, together with students sharing the same interests.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Linn&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Praeludia_Sponsaliorum_Plantarum.jpg" title="fig:Pollination depicted in  (1729)" alt="Pollination depicted in  (1729)" /> In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend <a href="Uppsala_University" title="wikilink">Uppsala University</a> on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: <a href="Olof_Rudbeck_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Olof Rudbeck the Younger</a> and <a href="Lars_Roberg" title="wikilink">Lars Roberg</a>. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, <a href="Olof_Celsius" title="wikilink">Olof Celsius</a>, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, <em></em> on <a href="plant_sexuality" title="wikilink">plant sexuality</a>. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of <a href="stamen" title="wikilink">stamens</a> and <a href="pistil" title="wikilink">pistils</a>. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, <em></em> and <em></em>. He also produced a book on the plants grown in the <a href="Linnaean_Garden" title="wikilink">Uppsala Botanical Garden</a>, <em></em>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Rudbeck's former assistant, <a href="Nils_Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_von_Rosenstein" title="wikilink">Nils Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</a>, returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus' botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a &quot;disagreement&quot; with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to <a href="Lapland_(Sweden)" title="wikilink">Lapland</a>; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native <a href="Sami_people" title="wikilink">Sami people</a>, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the <a href="Royal_Society_of_Sciences_in_Uppsala" title="wikilink">Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala</a> for his journey.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala in May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and <a href="ornithological" class="uri" title="wikilink">ornithological</a> manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near <a href="G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vle" class="uri" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vle</a> he found great quantities of <em>Campanula serpyllifolia</em>, later known as <em><a href="Linnaea_borealis" title="wikilink">Linnaea borealis</a></em>, the twinflower that would become his favourite.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and was particularly interested in <a href="moss" title="wikilink">mosses</a> and <a href="lichen" title="wikilink">lichens</a>, the latter a main part of the diet of the <a href="reindeer" class="uri" title="wikilink">reindeer</a>, a common animal in Lapland.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the <a href="Gulf_of_Bothnia" title="wikilink">Gulf of Bothnia</a>, making major inland incursions from <a href="Ume&lt;U+00E5&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ume&lt;U+00E5&gt;</a>, <a href="Lule&lt;U+00E5&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lule&lt;U+00E5&gt;</a> and <a href="Tornio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tornio</a>. He returned from his six-month long, over  expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Although Lapland was a region with limited <a href="biodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a>, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book <em></em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em></em> Linnaeus' ideas about <a href="nomenclature" class="uri" title="wikilink">nomenclature</a> and <a href="classification" class="uri" title="wikilink">classification</a> were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern <a href="Flora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flora</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was <a href="Augustin_Pyramus_de_Candolle" title="wikilink">Augustin Pyramus de Candolle</a> who attributed Linnaeus with <em></em> as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian <a href="Edward_Lee_Greene" title="wikilink">E. L. Greene</a> described <em></em> as &quot;the most classic and delightful&quot; of Linnaeus's works.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a <a href="Eureka_effect" title="wikilink">flash of insight</a> regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was traveling, Linnaeus remarked: &quot;If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="dalarna">Dalarna</h4>
<p>In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to <a href="Dalarna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalarna</a>. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at <a href="R&lt;U+00F8&gt;ros" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00F8&gt;ros</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' relations with Nils Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n worsened, and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in <a href="Falun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Falun</a> with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Sohland's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the <a href="Dutch_Republic" title="wikilink">Dutch Republic</a> and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the <a href="University_of_Harderwijk" title="wikilink">University of Harderwijk</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> On the way, they stopped in <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the <a href="taxidermy" title="wikilink">taxidermied</a> remains of a seven-headed <a href="Lernaean_Hydra" title="wikilink">hydra</a>. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the <a href="The_Beast_(Bible)" title="wikilink">Beast of Revelation</a>. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was <a href="Jan_Frederik_Gronovius" title="wikilink">Johan Frederik Gronovius</a> to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as <em></em>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, <a href="Herman_Boerhaave" title="wikilink">Herman Boerhaave</a>, who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist <a href="Johannes_Burman" title="wikilink">Johannes Burman</a>. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his <em></em>. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: <em></em> and <em></em>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="george-clifford">George Clifford</h4>

<p>In August, during Linnaeus' stay with Burman, he met <a href="George_Clifford_III" title="wikilink">George Clifford III</a>, a director of the <a href="Dutch_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch East India Company</a> and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of <a href="Hartekamp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hartekamp</a> in <a href="Heemstede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heemstede</a>. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of <a href="Hans_Sloane" title="wikilink">Sir Hans Sloane's</a> <em>Natural History of Jamaica</em>, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at Hartekamp, free to buy any book or plant he wanted.</p>
<p>In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, at Clifford's expense.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> He went to London to visit <a href="Hans_Sloane" title="wikilink">Sir Hans Sloane</a>, a collector of natural history, and to see his <a href="cabinet_of_curiosities" title="wikilink">cabinet</a>,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> as well as to visit the <a href="Chelsea_Physic_Garden" title="wikilink">Chelsea Physic Garden</a> and its keeper, <a href="Philip_Miller" title="wikilink">Philip Miller</a>. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in <em></em>. Miller was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus' system.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Linnaeus also traveled to <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a> to visit the botanist <a href="Johann_Jacob_Dillenius" title="wikilink">Johann Jacob Dillenius</a>. He failed, however, to make Dillenius publicly accept his new classification system. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The next year, he published <em></em>, in which he described 935 <a href="genera" class="uri" title="wikilink">genera</a> of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with <em></em>, with another sixty (<em>sexaginta</em>) genera.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>His work at Hartekamp led to another book, <em></em>, a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> It contains the first use of the name <em><a href="Nepenthes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nepenthes</a></em>, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of <a href="pitcher_plants" title="wikilink">pitcher plants</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> for about a month, visiting botanists such as <a href="Antoine_de_Jussieu" title="wikilink">Antoine de Jussieu</a>.

<p>Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, Sara Elisabeth Mor&lt;U+00E6&gt;a. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, <a href="Carl_Linnaeus_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Carl</a>. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died 15 days old.

<p><img src="CarlvonLinne_house.jpg" title="fig:The Linnaeus house in Uppsala" alt="The Linnaeus house in Uppsala" /> In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with the responsibility of the medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a>, instead.

<p>Ten days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of <a href="&lt;U+00D6&gt;land" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D6&gt;land</a> and <a href="Gotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gotland</a> with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to &lt;U+00D6&gt;land and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to <a href="Visby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visby</a> in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in <em></em>, written in Swedish. Like <em></em>, it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in &lt;U+00D6&gt;land and Gotland.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of <a href="V&lt;U+00E4&gt;sterg&lt;U+00F6&gt;tland" class="uri" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00E4&gt;sterg&lt;U+00F6&gt;tland</a>.

<p>In the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to <a href="Scania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scania</a>, again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof S&lt;U+00F6&gt;derberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow <a href="walnut" class="uri" title="wikilink">walnut</a> and <a href="Sorbus_intermedia" title="wikilink">Swedish whitebeam</a> trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles.

<p>In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his &quot;apostles&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him.

<h4 id="publishing-of-1">Publishing of <em></em></h4>
<p>Linnaeus published <em></em> in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works.

<p>Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and S&lt;U+00E4&gt;vja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the initial release of <em></em> in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the <a href="10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae" title="wikilink">tenth edition</a> was released in 1758.

<p>Linnaeus' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Ros&lt;U+00E9&gt;n. He developed <a href="sciatica" class="uri" title="wikilink">sciatica</a> in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognize himself as their author.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>The first edition of <em></em> was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. In it, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as &quot;<em></em>&quot;, were supplemented with concise and now familiar &quot;binomials&quot;, composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet &lt;U+2013&gt; in the case given, <em><a href="Physalis_angulata" title="wikilink">Physalis angulata</a></em>. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as <a href="binomial_nomenclature" title="wikilink">binomial nomenclature</a>, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see <a href="Gaspard_Bauhin" title="wikilink">Gaspard Bauhin</a> and <a href="Johann_Bauhin" title="wikilink">Johann Bauhin</a>) almost 200 years earlier,<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.</p>
<h3 id="section"><em></em></h3>

<p><em></em> (or, more fully, <em></em>) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of <a href="botanical_nomenclature" title="wikilink">plant nomenclature</a> as it exists today.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1754, Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes. One, <a href="Cryptogamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cryptogamia</a>, included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="section-1"><em></em></h4>

<p><em></em> was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="section-2"><em></em></h4>

<p><em></em> (1751) was a summary of Linnaeus' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in <em></em> (1736) and <em></em> (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his <em></em> and <em></em>: all were printed in Holland (as well as <em></em> (1737) and <em></em> (1735)), the <em>Philosophia</em> being simultaneously released in Stockholm.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>According to German biologist <a href="Ernst_Haeckel" title="wikilink">Ernst Haeckel</a>, the question of man's origin began with Linnaeus.

<p>Linnaeus classified humans among the <a href="primate" title="wikilink">primates</a> (as they were later called) beginning with the first edition of <em></em>.

This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably <a href="Georges_Cuvier" title="wikilink">Georges Cuvier</a>. Some elevated the distinction to the level of <a href="order_(biology)" title="wikilink">order</a>. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates &lt;U+2014&gt; and especially the great apes &lt;U+2014&gt; made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a> wrote, in <em><a href="The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex" title="wikilink">The Descent of Man</a></em> in 1871:<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed <a href="Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach" title="wikilink">Blumenbach</a> and <a href="Georges_Cuvier" title="wikilink">Cuvier</a>, and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by <a href="Theodor_Ludwig_Wilhelm_Bischoff" title="wikilink">Bischoff</a>, <a href="Christoph_Theodor_Aeby" title="wikilink">Aeby</a>, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the <a href="great_chain_of_being" title="wikilink">great chain of being</a>, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the <a href="image_of_God" title="wikilink">image of God</a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> (<a href="theomorphism" class="uri" title="wikilink">theomorphism</a>), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> The conflict between <a href="worldview" title="wikilink">worldviews</a> based on <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a> and <a href="theology" class="uri" title="wikilink">theology</a> that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, <a href="creation&lt;U+2013&gt;evolution_controversy" title="wikilink">creation&lt;U+2013&gt;evolution controversy</a> began in earnest with the publication of <a href="On_the_Origin_of_Species" title="wikilink">On the Origin of Species</a> by <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a> in 1859.</p>
<p>After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of <em></em> introduced new terms, including <em>Mammalia</em> and <em>Primates</em>, the latter of which would replace <em>Anthropomorpha</em><a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> as well as giving humans the full binomial <em>Homo sapiens</em>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature, not be a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> In his book <em></em>, he said, &quot;One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a> and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
