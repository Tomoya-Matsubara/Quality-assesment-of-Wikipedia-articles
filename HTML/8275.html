<p><strong><em>Apatosaurus</em></strong> (meaning &quot;deceptive reptile&quot; ) is an <a href="extinct" class="uri" title="wikilink">extinct</a> <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> of <a href="sauropod" class="uri" title="wikilink">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinosaur</a> that lived in North America during the <a href="Late_Jurassic" title="wikilink">Late Jurassic</a> <a href="period_(geology)" title="wikilink">period</a>. The genus was first described in 1877 when <a href="Othniel_Charles_Marsh" title="wikilink">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> named <em>A. ajax</em>, and many species have since been described. They range in age from about 154 to 150 million years ago throughout the <a href="Kimmeridgian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kimmeridgian</a> and early <a href="Tithonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tithonian</a> ages of the <a href="Morrison_Formation" title="wikilink">Morrison Formation</a>. Among the species is <em>A. excelsus</em>, long considered to be separate under the genus <em>Brontosaurus</em>, which is now considered a <a href="junior_synonym" title="wikilink">junior synonym</a> of <em>Apatosaurus</em>. It had an average length of  and a mass of at least , although a few specimens indicate a length up to 30% greater and a weight of . <em>Apatosaurus</em> was one of the more common sauropods in the Morrison, along with <em><a href="Diplodocus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diplodocus</a></em> and <em><a href="Camarasaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camarasaurus</a></em>.</p>
<p>The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of <em>Diplodocus</em> and the bones of the leg were much stockier despite being longer, implying that <em>Apatosaurus</em> was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like all sauropods, <em>Apatosaurus</em> had only one claw on the forelimbs and three on its hindlimbs. The skull of <em>Apatosaurus</em>, long thought to be similar to <em>Camarasaurus</em>, is much more similar to that of <em>Diplodocus</em>.</p>
<p><em>Apatosaurus</em> is a genus in the family <a href="Diplodocidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diplodocidae</a>. It is more <a href="basal_(phylogenetics)" title="wikilink">basal</a> than other genera like <em>Diplodocus</em> and <em><a href="Barosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barosaurus</a></em>, and is sometimes included in its own subfamily, <a href="Apatosaurinae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apatosaurinae</a>. <em>Apatosaurus</em> is one of the more common sauropods in the Morrison Formation, and is often found associated with skeletons of <em><a href="Allosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allosaurus</a></em>, <em>Camarasaurus</em>, <em><a href="Stegosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stegosaurus</a></em> and <em>Diplodocus</em>. <em>Apatosaurus</em> is also one of the longer Morrison dinosaurs, although <em><a href="Supersaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Supersaurus</a></em> exceeds it.</p>

The caudal vertebra number was noted to differ individually, even within a species. The cervical vertebrae were stouter than other <a href="diplodocid" title="wikilink">diplodocids</a>, and found to be most similar to <em>Camarasaurus</em> by <a href="Charles_Whitney_Gilmore" title="wikilink">Charles Whitney Gilmore</a>. The Atlas-Axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused in <em>Apatosaurus louisae</em>. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae, instead loosely articulated.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> There are ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. <em>Apatosaurus</em>, like its close relative <em><a href="Supersaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Supersaurus</a></em>, has tall spines on its vertebrae, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid, being comparatively slender, due to the vertebral spines rapidly decreasing in height the farther they are from the hips. <em>Apatosaurus</em> also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> As in other diplodocids, the last portion of the tail of <em>Apatosaurus</em> possessed a whip-like structure.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <img src="Dinosaur_mayse_shoulder_blade.jpg" title="fig:Shoulder blade of Apatosaurus in excavation" alt="Shoulder blade of Apatosaurus in excavation" /> The limb bones were also very robust.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Within the genus, the <a href="scapula" class="uri" title="wikilink">scapula</a> of <em>A. louisae</em> is intermediate in morphology between those of <em>A. ajax</em> and <em>A. excelsus</em>. The arm bones are snout, with the <a href="humerus" class="uri" title="wikilink">humerus</a> resembling that of <em>Camarasaurus</em>, and those of <em>A. excelsus</em> and <em>A. ajax</em> nearly identical. Gilmore in 1936 noted that previous reconstructions erroneously proposed that the <a href="radius" class="uri" title="wikilink">radius</a> and <a href="ulna" class="uri" title="wikilink">ulna</a> could cross, when in life they would have remained parallel.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <em>Apatosaurus</em> had a single large claw on each forelimb, and the first three toes possessed claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) on the forelimb has two bones, the next has one, etc.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Even by 1936 it was recognized that no sauropod manus preserved more than one claw,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> a feature currently recognised for the entire group.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The single manual <a href="ungual" class="uri" title="wikilink">ungual</a> is slightly curved, and squarely truncated on the anterior end.

The femora of <em>A. louisae</em> are the stoutest of any member of Sauropoda. Rugosities are present on both ends of the femur, and the top end protrudes above the <a href="great_trochanter" title="wikilink">great trochanter</a>. The tibia and fibula bones are nearly indistinguishable from those of <em>Camarasaurus</em>, although they are different from the slender bones of <em>Diplodocus</em>. The fibula is longer than the tibia, although it is also more slender. The foot of <em>Apatosaurus</em> has three claws on the innermost digits, and the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. In an individual of <em>A. louisae</em>, the <a href="astragalus" class="uri" title="wikilink">astragalus</a> was not found fused to the tibia.

Sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry were added, a tail fashioned to appear as earlier Marsh believed it should with too few vertebrae, and a sculpted model of what the museum felt the skull of this massive creature might look like. This was not a delicate skull like that of <em>Diplodocus</em>, which would later turn out to be more accurate, but was based on &quot;the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> These skulls were likely those of <em>Camarasaurus</em>, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find <em>Apatosaurus</em> skulls. Unlike what is thought that the mounts used skulls of <em>Camarasaurus</em>, Hermann was instead forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn noted in a publication that the skull was &quot;largely conjectural and based on that of <em>Morosaurus</em>&quot; (now <em>Camarasaurus</em>).<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <img src="Field_Museum_Apatosaurus_mount,_1909.jpg" title="fig:Unfinished A. sp. mount (FMNH P25112) in the Field Museum of Natural History, 1909" alt="Unfinished A. sp. mount (FMNH P25112) in the Field Museum of Natural History, 1909" /> Despite the much-publicized debut of the mounted skeleton, which cemented the name <em>Brontosaurus</em> in the public consciousness, Riggs had published a paper in the 1903 edition of <em>Geological Series of the Field Columbian Museum</em> that argued that <em>Brontosaurus</em> was not different enough from <em>Apatosaurus</em> to warrant its own genus, and created the combination <em>Apatosaurus excelsus</em>. Riggs stated that &quot;In view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous. As the term 'Apatosaurus' has priority, 'Brontosaurus' will be regarded as a synonym&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Since Riggs published his opinions, almost all paleontologists have agreed that the two species should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the <a href="International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="wikilink">ICZN</a> (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name <em>Apatosaurus</em>, having been published first, had priority as the official name; <em>Brontosaurus</em> is considered a <a href="Synonym_(taxonomy)" title="wikilink">junior synonym</a> and has therefore been discarded from formal use.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite this, at least one paleontologist&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Robert_T._Bakker" title="wikilink">Robert T. Bakker</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;argued in the 1990s that <em>A. ajax</em> and <em>A. excelsus</em> are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This idea has not been accepted by most palaeontologists.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1903 Riggs also described a new specimen of <em>Apatosaurus</em>, which was then placed in the collections of the Field Columbian Museum. Found near the Grand River Valley of Fruita, Colorado, the last cervical vertebrae were exposed from the hillside. Those cervicals were articulated with the thoratic vertebrae, which were excavated from the slope. Ten feet downhill, the distal end of a femur could be seen in the matrix. The rocks were so hard that drills and dynamite had to be used to extract the specimen. Nearly the entire rear of the skeleton was uncovered, measuring . Apparently when first preserved, the entire skeleton was present, but the cervical vertebrae and forelimbs were eroded away.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <img src="Yale_Peabody_Apatosaurus_skull_sculpt.jpg" title="fig:Hypothetical skull, sculpted in 1931, Yale Peabody Museum" alt="Hypothetical skull, sculpted in 1931, Yale Peabody Museum" /> The skull, from the Carnegie Quarry expeditions by Earl Douglass, was found a few meters away from a skeleton identified as <em>Apatosaurus</em>, soon named <em>A. louisae</em>, after Andrew Carnegie's wife Louise. The skull was designated as CM 11162, and bore a very similar morphology to skulls of <em>Diplodocus</em>. It was accepted as belonging to the <em>Apatosaurus</em> by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although the scientific consensus was that it was of a different genus. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Obsorn, Keith Parsons suspected that Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, a cast of a <em>Camarasaurus</em> skull ended up being placed on the mount.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <img src="Apatosaurus_ajax_skull.jpg" title="fig:Authentic A. ajax skull, specimen CMC VP 7180" alt="Authentic A. ajax skull, specimen CMC VP 7180" /> At the Yale Peabody Museum, a skeleton was mounted in 1931 with a skull unique from all the others, while at the time most museums were using <em>Camarasaurus</em> casts, the Peabody Museum sculpted a completely different skull. They based the lower jaw off a <em>Camarasaurus</em> mandible, with the cranium resembling Marsh's 1891 illustration. The skull also included forward-pointing nasals, something truly different from any dinosaur, and fenestrae differing from the drawing and other skulls.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>No <em>Apatosaurus</em> skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of <em>Diplodocus</em> and <em>Apatosaurus</em>. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that <em>Apatosaurus</em> had a <em>Diplodocus</em> like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to <em>Diplodocus</em> might instead be those of <em>Apatosaurus</em>. They reassigned multiple skulls to <em>Apatosaurus</em> based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that <em>Apatosaurus</em> might have possessed a <em>Camarasaurus</em> like skull, based on a disarticulated <em>Camarasaurus</em>-like tooth found at the precise site where an <em>Apatosaurus</em> specimen was found years before.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On October 20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of <em>Apatosaurus</em> was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The Felch Quarry skull that Marsh included in his 1896 skeletal restoration was suggested to belong to <em><a href="Brachiosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brachiosaurus</a></em> sp. instead in 1998.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In 2011, a unique <em>Apatosaurus</em> specimen was first described.

Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) suggest that <em>Apatosaurus</em> had a great feeding range as its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether these sauropods grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Matthew Cobley <em>et al.</em> (2013) disputed this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements. They state that the feeding ranges for sauropods like <em>Diplodocus</em> were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The conclusions of Cobley <em>et al.</em> were disputed by Taylor, who analysed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of <em>Apatosaurus</em> and <em>Diplodocus</em>.

<p><img src="Infant_Apatosaurus_dinosaur_tracks.jpg" title="fig:Tracks of a juvenile, indicating bipedal posture" alt="Tracks of a juvenile, indicating bipedal posture" /> Diplodocids, like <em>Apatosaurus</em>, are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies suggest that diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have permitted the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like <em>Apatosaurus</em> were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Other studies by Taylor find that all <a href="tetrapod" title="wikilink">tetrapods</a> appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. <em>Apatosaurus</em>, like <em>Diplodocus</em>, would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, footprints of a juvenile <em>Apatosaurus</em> were reported from Quarry Five in Morrison, Colorado. Discovered in 2006 by Matthew Mossbrucker, these footprints show that juveniles could run on their hind legs in a manner similar to that of the modern <a href="Basiliscus_(genus)" title="wikilink">basilisk</a> lizard.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Trackways of <em>Apatosaurus</em> and other sauropods show that they walked an average of  per day.

<p>Various uses have been proposed for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods. It has been suggested that they were for defence, but the shape and size of them makes this unlikely.

Beginning with the assumption that <em>Apatosaurus</em>, like <a href="crocodilia" title="wikilink">crocodilians</a>, did not have a diaphragm, the <a href="dead_space_(physiology)" title="wikilink">dead-space volume</a> (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about  for a  specimen. Its <a href="Lung_volumes" title="wikilink">tidal volume</a> (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) has been calculated by Paladino to be  with an avian <a href="respiratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">respiratory</a> system,  if mammalian and  if reptilian.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been <a href="parabronchi" class="uri" title="wikilink">parabronchi</a>, with multiple pulmonary air sacs like in <a href="avian_lungs" title="wikilink">avian lungs</a> and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would need a lung volume of only about  compared to a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the available space. The overall thoracic volume of <em>Apatosaurus</em> has been estimated at  allowing for a , four-chambered <a href="heart" class="uri" title="wikilink">heart</a> and a  lung capacity. That would allow about  for the necessary <a href="Biological_tissue" title="wikilink">tissue</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Evidence for the avian system in <em>Apatosaurus</em> and other sauropods is also in the <a href="Skeletal_pneumaticity" title="wikilink">pneumaticity</a> of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states that they also likely connected to air sacs as in birds.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>James Spotila <em>et al.</em> (1991) suggest that the large body size of <em>Apatosaurus</em> and other sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates as they would not be able to release enough heat.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> They assumed that the animals had a reptilian respiratory system.

<p><img src="Baby_Apatosaurus_OMNH.jpg" title="fig:Juvenile A. sp. mount, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History" alt="Juvenile A. sp. mount, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History" /> A 1999 microscopic study of <em>Apatosaurus</em> bones concluded that the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10 years.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> In 2008, a study on the growth rates for sauropods was published, authored by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They found that by using growth lines and length to mass, <em>Apatosaurus</em> would have attained a mass of  in 15 years. This would imply sauropods had a growth rate of  per year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found <em>Apatosaurus</em> to stop growing at 70 years of age, growing  per year.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> These estimates have been suggested to be unreliable as the methods producing them are not sound as old growth lines would have been obliterated due to bone remodelling.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> One of the first identified growth factors of <em>Apatosaurus</em> was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by maturity.

<p>Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached.

<p>An article that appeared in the November 1997 issue of <em><a href="Discover_Magazine" title="wikilink">Discover Magazine</a></em> reported research into the mechanics of <em>Apatosaurus</em> tails by <a href="Nathan_Myhrvold" title="wikilink">Nathan Myhrvold</a>, a <a href="computer_scientist" title="wikilink">computer scientist</a> from <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a>.

<p>A <a href="pathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathology</a> has also been identified on the tail of <em>Apatosaurus</em>, due to a growth defect.

<p><em>Apatosaurus</em> have often been depicted in cinema, beginning with <a href="Winsor_McCay" title="wikilink">Winsor McCay</a>'s 1914 classic <em><a href="Gertie_the_Dinosaur" title="wikilink">Gertie the Dinosaur</a></em>, one of the first animated films.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> McCay based his unidentified dinosaur on the <em>Brontosaurus</em> skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The 1925 silent film <em><a href="The_Lost_World_(1925_film)" title="wikilink">The Lost World</a></em> featured a battle between a <em>Brontosaurus</em> and an <em>Allosaurus</em>, using <a href="special_effect" title="wikilink">special effects</a> by <a href="Willis_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Willis O'Brien</a>.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> These, and other early uses of the animal as major representative of the group, helped cement <em>Brontosaurus</em> as a quintessential dinosaur in the public consciousness.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Sinclair_Oil_Corporation" title="wikilink">Sinclair Oil Corporation</a> has long been a fixture of American roads (and briefly in other countries) with its green dinosaur logo and mascot, an <em>Apatosaurus</em> (<em>Brontosaurus</em>). While Sinclair's early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs, eventually only <em>Apatosaurus</em> was used as the official logo, due to its popular appeal.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>As late as 1989, the <a href="United_States_Postal_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Post Office</a> caused controversy when it issued four &quot;dinosaur&quot; stamps: <em><a href="Tyrannosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyrannosaurus</a></em>, <em>Stegosaurus</em>, <em><a href="Pteranodon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pteranodon</a></em> and <em>Brontosaurus</em>. The use of the term <em>Brontosaurus</em> in place of <em>Apatosaurus</em>, as well as the fact that <em>Pteranodon</em>s were technically pterosaurs and not dinosaurs, led to complaints of &quot;fostering scientific illiteracy.&quot;<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The Post Office defended itself (in Postal Bulletin 21744) by saying, &quot;Although now recognized by the scientific community as <em>Apatosaurus</em>, the name 'Brontosaurus' was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population.&quot; <a href="Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="wikilink">Stephen Jay Gould</a> also supported this position in his essay &quot;<a href="Bully_for_Brontosaurus" title="wikilink">Bully for Brontosaurus</a>&quot;, though he echoed Riggs's original argument that <em>Brontosaurus</em> is a synonym for <em>Apatosaurus</em>. Nevertheless, he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
