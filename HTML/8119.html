<p><strong>Otto Everett Graham, Jr.</strong> ( – ) was an <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> who played for the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> in the <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> and <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>. Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 114 wins, 20 losses and four ties, including a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;3 <a href="Winning_percentage" title="wikilink">win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record</a> in the <a href="National_Football_League_playoffs" title="wikilink">playoffs</a>. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average <a href="Yards_from_scrimmage" title="wikilink">yards gained</a> per <a href="Forward_pass#American_and_Canadian_football" title="wikilink">pass attempt</a>, with nine. Long-time <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a>, a friend of Graham's, once called him &quot;as great of a quarterback as there ever was.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Graham grew up in <a href="Waukegan,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, the son of music teachers. He entered <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Graham played during the 1946 season for the <a href="National_Basketball_League_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Basketball League's</a> <a href="Sacramento_Kings" title="wikilink">Rochester Royals</a>, who won the league championship that year. <a href="Paul_Brown" title="wikilink">Paul Brown</a>, Cleveland's coach, signed Graham to play for the Browns, where he thrived. After he left football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the <a href="College_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">College All-Star Game</a> and became head football coach at the <a href="Coast_Guard_Academy" title="wikilink">Coast Guard Academy</a> in <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-college-career">Early life and college career</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="Waukegan,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, Graham's first interest growing up was music. Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, <a href="cornet" class="uri" title="wikilink">cornet</a> and <a href="French_horn" title="wikilink">French horn</a>. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> on a basketball scholarship in 1940.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> There he played on the varsity basketball team as a <a href="freshman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freshman</a> and continued to study music.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Graham did not take up football until his <a href="sophomore" class="uri" title="wikilink">sophomore</a> year, when Northwestern coach <a href="Pappy_Waldorf" title="wikilink">Pappy Waldorf</a> saw him throwing in an <a href="Intramural_sports" title="wikilink">intramural</a> game and invited him to practice with the team.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team.

<p>Graham's first game for the <a href="Northwestern_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Northwestern Wildcats football</a> team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a <a href="Kansas_State_University" title="wikilink">Kansas State</a> <a href="punt_(football)" title="wikilink">punt</a> and <a href="Punt_(football)#Return" title="wikilink">returned</a> it 90 yards for a <a href="touchdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchdown</a>.

<p>As America's involvement in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> intensified after the  <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Graham signed up for service alongside many fellow student-athletes, entering the <a href="U.S._Navy_Air_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy Air Corps</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty.

<p>The following year, Graham and some of his teammates enlisted in the military but continued to play for Northwestern.

<p>Impressed by Graham's performances in Northwestern's wins over Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in  dollars) in 1945 to play for a professional team he was coaching in <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> in the new <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly <a href="stipend" class="uri" title="wikilink">stipend</a> of $250 ($ in ) until the end of the war. It was a large amount of money at the time. &quot;All I asked was, where do I sign?&quot; Graham said later. &quot;Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever.&quot; Graham was also drafted by the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a>, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.</p>
<p>Large numbers of athletes came home as the conflict wound down in Europe with <a href="German_Instrument_of_Surrender" title="wikilink">Germany's surrender</a> in the summer of 1945. The AAFC's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the <a href="Rochester_Royals" title="wikilink">Rochester Royals</a> of the <a href="National_Basketball_League_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Basketball League</a> (NBL), a forerunner of the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a>.

<p>By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, <a href="Training_camp_(National_Football_League)" title="wikilink">training camp</a> for Brown's new team, the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, had already begun. Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in <a href="Cliff_Lewis" title="wikilink">Cliff Lewis</a> at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown's <a href="T_formation" title="wikilink">T formation</a> offense. Handing the ball to <a href="fullback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">fullback</a> <a href="Marion_Motley" title="wikilink">Marion Motley</a> and throwing to <a href="Wide_receiver" title="wikilink">ends</a> <a href="Dante_Lavelli" title="wikilink">Dante Lavelli</a> and <a href="Mac_Speedie" title="wikilink">Mac Speedie</a>, Graham led the team to a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the <a href="New_York_Yankees_(AAFC)" title="wikilink">AAFC's New York Yankees</a>. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's first perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied.</p>
<p>Graham's play was crucial to Cleveland's success. He averaged 10.5 yards per pass and had a <a href="quarterback_rating" title="wikilink">quarterback rating</a> of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until <a href="Joe_Montana" title="wikilink">Joe Montana</a> surpassed it in 1989. Graham was named the AAFC's Most Valuable Player in 1947 and shared the Most Valuable Player award with <a href="Frankie_Albert" title="wikilink">Frankie Albert</a> of the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 1948. He led the league in passing yards between 1947 and 1949. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>. Graham was the AAFC's all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085 yards and 86 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Graham became the Browns' uncontested leader, but he was also &quot;just one of the guys,&quot; tackle <a href="Mike_McCormack_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Mike McCormack</a> said in 1999. &quot;He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today.&quot; He was good at spinning and moving in the <a href="Passing_pocket" title="wikilink">pocket</a>, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. &quot;I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm,&quot; Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. &quot;I used to catch a lot of them one-handed,&quot; Lavelli said. &quot;He had great touch in his hands.&quot; He was nicknamed &quot;Automatic Otto&quot; for his consistency and toughness.</p>
<h3 id="cleveland-browns-in-the-nfl-1950u20131955">Cleveland Browns in the NFL (1950&lt;U+2013&gt;1955)</h3>
<p>With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. Graham led the Browns to a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;2 record, which set up a playoff against the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> for a spot in the <a href="1950_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">championship game</a>. The Browns' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen <a href="Cleveland_Stadium" title="wikilink">Cleveland Stadium</a> on  Cleveland beat New York. With the game tied 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45 yards by running with the ball on a long drive to set up a 28-yard <a href="Lou_Groza" title="wikilink">Lou Groza</a> field goal that put the Browns ahead 6&lt;U+2013&gt;3. A <a href="Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_score)" title="wikilink">safety</a> after the ensuing kickoff made the final score 8&lt;U+2013&gt;3.</p>
<p>The win put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the <a href="Los_Angeles_Rams" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a>. Graham's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns' 30&lt;U+2013&gt;28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win. Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game, adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Cleveland posted a 11&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record in 1951, losing its only game to the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the <a href="1951_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">championship game</a>, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 27&lt;U+2013&gt;17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14&lt;U+2013&gt;10. Three of his throws were <a href="interception_(American_football)" title="wikilink">intercepted</a>, but he put up 280 yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.</p>
<p>With Graham at quarterback, Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record and faced the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> in the <a href="1952_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">NFL championship game</a>. Despite gaining 384 total yards to Detroit's 258, Graham and the Browns lost their second straight championship, 17&lt;U+2013&gt;7. Cleveland had several long drives that ended with missed field goals, and a fourth-quarter touchdown was negated because Graham's throw to <a href="Pete_Brewster" title="wikilink">Pete Brewster</a> was first tipped by receiver <a href="Ray_Renfro" title="wikilink">Ray Renfro</a>; under rules in place at the time, balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions. After the season, as Graham was practicing for the <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowl</a> in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> on  his six-week-old son Stephen died from a severe cold.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1953 season began with a 27&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns. It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from <a href="Art_Michalik" title="wikilink">Art Michalik</a> that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record, Cleveland lost in the <a href="1953_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">championship game</a> for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17&lt;U+2013&gt;16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to &quot;jump off a building&quot; for letting his teammates down. &quot;I was the main factor in losing,&quot; he said. &quot;If I had played my usual game, we would have won.&quot; Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.</p>
<p>Before the start of the Browns' 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the <a href="Sam_Sheppard" title="wikilink">Sam Sheppard</a> murder case. Sheppard, an <a href="osteopath" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteopath</a>, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the <a href="1954_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">championship</a>, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56&lt;U+2013&gt;10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more. He announced his retirement after the game.</p>
<p>After Graham's potential replacements struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year. He was offered a salary of $25,000 ($ today), making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The Browns lost the opener against the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>, but went on to a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;2 regular-season record and another chance at a <a href="1955_NFL_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">championship</a>. Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38&lt;U+2013&gt;14. When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd in the <a href="Los_Angeles_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Coliseum</a> gave him a standing ovation. It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham's team reached the championship each year and won seven. &quot;Nothing would induce me to come back,&quot; he said later. He was the NFL's passing leader and Most Valuable Player in 1955. He also won the <a href="Hickok_Belt" title="wikilink">Hickok Belt</a>, awarded to the best professional athlete of the year.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Without Graham, the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7 record, their first-ever losing season.</p>

He still holds the NFL career record for yards per pass attempt, averaging nine.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Graham was inducted into the <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Having won seven championships in 10 seasons and reached the championship game in every year he played, Graham is regarded by sportswriters as one of the greatest winners of all time and one of the best professional quarterbacks ever to play the game.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He never missed a game in his career.</p>
