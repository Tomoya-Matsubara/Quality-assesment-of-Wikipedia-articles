<h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The first known specimens of the northern sawtail catshark were collected during exploratory surveys conducted off northeastern Australia in the 1980s, and provisionally termed <em>Galeus</em> sp. B. It was formally described by Daniel Gledhill, Peter Last, and William White in a 2008 <a href="Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) publication, in which they also resurrected the genus <em>Figaro</em>, until then considered a <a href="junior_synonym" title="wikilink">junior synonym</a> of <em>Galeus</em>. The <a href="specific_epithet" title="wikilink">specific epithet</a> <em>striatus</em> means &quot;striped&quot; in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>. The <a href="type_specimen" title="wikilink">type specimen</a> is a  long adult male caught south of the <a href="Saumarez_Reefs" title="wikilink">Saumarez Reefs</a>, <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>, on November 17, 1985.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="distribution-and-habitat">Distribution and habitat</h2>
<p>The range of the northern sawtail catshark is limited to the upper <a href="continental_slope" title="wikilink">continental slope</a> off Queensland, between <a href="Rockhampton,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Rockhampton</a> and <a href="Townsville,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Townsville</a>. It is found <a href="demersal_fish" title="wikilink">on or near the bottom</a> at a depth of .<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Reaching  in length, the northern sawtail catshark has a firm, thin body with a mostly cylindrical cross-section. The head is short, narrow, and flattened, with a bluntly pointed snout. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary <a href="nictitating_membrane" title="wikilink">nictitating membranes</a> (protective third eyelids); beneath each is a narrow ridge, and behind is a tiny <a href="spiracle" class="uri" title="wikilink">spiracle</a>. The anterior rims of the nostrils are enlarged into triangular, outward-pointing flaps. The mouth is large and arched, with short but prominent furrows around each corner. There are around 65 upper and 61&lt;U+2013&gt;65 lower tooth rows; each tooth has a narrow central cusp flanked by 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of <a href="gill_slit" title="wikilink">gill slits</a>; the fourth and fifth are located over the <a href="pectoral_fin" title="wikilink">pectoral fin</a> bases and closer together than the others.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The small <a href="dorsal_fin" title="wikilink">dorsal fins</a> have blunt apexes and straight to gently convex trailing margins; the first is slightly taller but shorter-based than the second. The origin of the first and second dorsal fins lie over the rear of the pelvic fins and <a href="anal_fin" title="wikilink">anal fin</a> respectively. The pectoral fins are small and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic fins are long and low; adult males have slender <a href="claspers" class="uri" title="wikilink">claspers</a> and a slight &quot;apron&quot; formed from the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins. The <a href="anal_fin" title="wikilink">anal fin</a> is elongated, its base measuring roughly a tenth of the total length, and rather angular. The length of the anal fin base exceeds the distance between the anal and pelvic fins, and is comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins. The <a href="caudal_fin" title="wikilink">caudal fin</a> is short and low, with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body and fins are entirely covered by minute, overlapping <a href="dermal_denticle" title="wikilink">dermal denticles</a>; each has an ovoid crown with a horizontal ridge leading to a marginal cusp. There are distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny denticles along the anterior half of the caudal fin upper margin, and beneath the <a href="caudal_peduncle" title="wikilink">caudal peduncle</a>. This species is light grayish brown on the back of the body and tail, with a series of dark brown saddles numbering 10&lt;U+2013&gt;16 before the dorsal fins, of which a few are wider than the others. The flanks, underside, and fins are whitish.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
