<p><img src="Maria_Bartiromo_on_Times_Square.jpg" title="fig:Maria Bartiromo advertisement in Times Square." alt="Maria Bartiromo advertisement in Times Square." width="230" /> Before joining CNBC in 1993, Bartiromo was a producer and assignment editor with <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> Business News.</p>
<p>Although Bartiromo was not the first person (she took over from analyst Roy Blumberg) to report regularly live from the floor of the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>, she quickly became the most popular. With CNBC she hosted their <em><a href="Market_Watch" title="wikilink">Market Watch</a></em> program from 10:00 to 12:00 <a href="North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">ET</a>, as well as being a regular contributor to <em><a href="Squawk_Box" title="wikilink">Squawk Box</a></em> for many years before leaving the morning program. Bartiromo was nicknamed the <em>Money Honey</em> during the boom years of the stock market in the late 1990s due to her striking looks. She was also nicknamed the &quot;Econo Babe&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the 90s, the nickname &quot;Money Honey&quot; has spread to refer to attractive female financial news reporters in general. On <a href="January_16" title="wikilink">January 16</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Bartiromo filed to trademark the term for herself. The multiple trademark applications were for many children's products including piggy banks, cookie jars, mouse pads, jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, comic books, notepads, children's paper place mats, coupon books, backpacks and items like toy banks and toy cash registers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>She has also made appearances on numerous non-financial television shows, including <a href="NBC_Universal" title="wikilink">NBC Universal's</a> <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show" title="wikilink">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></em>, <em><a href="Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher" title="wikilink">Real Time with Bill Maher</a></em>, <em><a href="Late_Night_with_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Caroline_Rhea_Show" title="wikilink">The Caroline Rhea Show</a></em>, <em><a href="McEnroe" class="uri" title="wikilink">McEnroe</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">The Colbert Report</a></em>, as well as guest-hosting on <em><a href="Live_with_Regis_and_Kelly" title="wikilink">Live with Regis and Kelly</a></em>.</p>
<p>Her first book was <em>Use the News: How to Separate the Noise from the Investment Nuggets and Make Money in Any Economy</em>.</p>
<p>Bartiromo currently (as of 2008) co-anchors with <a href="Dylan_Ratigan" title="wikilink">Dylan Ratigan</a> the <em><a href="Closing_Bell" title="wikilink">Closing Bell</a></em> show on CNBC from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM ET.

<li><a href="Nicholas_Maier" title="wikilink">Nicholas Maier</a>, a former employee of <a href="Jim_Cramer" title="wikilink">Jim Cramer</a>, alleged in his book, <em>Trading with the Enemy</em> (Collins, 2002), that Cramer would feed rumors to Bartiromo intended to affect the value of his positions when Bartiromo repeated them on the air. Time characterizes this as Cramer &quot;gaming&quot; Bartiromo. Cramer denied the accusation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>

<li>In 2003, Bartiromo interviewed <a href="Citigroup" class="uri" title="wikilink">Citigroup</a>'s CEO, <a href="Sanford_I._Weill" title="wikilink">Sanford I. Weill</a>, she prefaced the interview with a &quot;<em>full disclosure</em>&quot; statement that she owned 1,000 shares of Citigroup stock. A number of journalism boards consider it unethical for reporters to own shares in the companies on which they report, and CNBC subsequently updated its disclosure policy.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Media interest also surrounded Bartiromo when she broke live on CNBC that <a href="Federal_Reserve" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve</a> Chairman <a href="Ben_Bernanke" title="wikilink">Ben Bernanke</a> had told her at the annual <a href="White_House_Correspondents&#39;_Association#WHCA_Dinner_(WHCD)" title="wikilink">White House Correspondents' Association dinner</a> in May 2006 that his position on interest rates was &quot;misunderstood&quot;. This appeared to indicate that Bernanke's interest rate stance was less <a href="Federal_Open_Market_Committee#Stance_on_inflation" title="wikilink">dovish</a> than had been interpreted by some market analysts. Other members of the press, along with Bernanke himself, felt that the comments had been made <a href="Journalism_sourcing#Using_confidential_information" title="wikilink">off the record</a>, and that by using her seemingly random seating position at the dinner, Bartiromo got access to market-making news which other reporters had no way of attaining (interest rates, and speculation on them, being a crucial price-setting tool for many financial instruments). A CNBC spokesman responded that Bernanke had never told Bartiromo that his remarks were off the record.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2007, controversy arose over the nature of Bartiromo's relationship with Todd Thomson, former chief of Citigroup's wealth management unit. Thomson at one point flew with a group of employees to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, then left the employees to make their own arrangements for the trip back while he took the corporate jet back to the U.S. with Bartiromo.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In another instance, Thomson spent $5 million for the sponsorship of programming on the <a href="Sundance_Channel" title="wikilink">Sundance Channel</a> that Bartiromo was tapped to host.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Thomson was eventually ousted by Citigroup for reasons including his contact with Bartiromo.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> CNBC has stood by Bartiromo, claiming that her relationship with Thomson was a case of &quot;legitimate business assignments&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
