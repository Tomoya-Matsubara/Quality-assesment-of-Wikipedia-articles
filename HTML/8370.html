<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>A gifted artist, Kuwata started out as a manga artist at the young age of 13, when he created  in 1948. His turning point came in 1957, when he created  (which was adapted into a <a href="tokusatsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">tokusatsu</a> TV series in 1959). Since then, Kuwata devoted himself to creating <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a>/<a href="superhero" class="uri" title="wikilink">superhero</a> adventures. His most famous was <em><a href="8_Man" title="wikilink">8 Man</a></em>, which he co-created with writer <a href="Kazumasa_Hirai_(author)" title="wikilink">Kazumasa Hirai</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in 1965, when he was to finish the final issue of <em><a href="8_Man" title="wikilink">8 Man</a></em>, he was arrested for possessing a handgun (he had contemplated suicide). With Kuwata in jail, co-creator Hirai got other manga artists to finish the final issue, but wasn't satisfied with it. It was published in a manga magazine, but has never before been reprinted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kuwata, released from prison shortly thereafter, continued his manga work well into the 1970s, but also ran into depression and alcoholism. In 1977, he had an epiphany and converted to <a href="Buddhism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a>. He has since done beautiful art books about the life of <a href="Gautama_Buddha" title="wikilink">Buddha</a>. He also occasionally got back into manga work, and in 1992, he agreed to do his own version of the final issue of <em><a href="8_Man" title="wikilink">8 Man</a></em>, upon being asked by co-creator/friend Kazumasa Hirai.</p>
