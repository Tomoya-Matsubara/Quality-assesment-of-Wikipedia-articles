<p>The <strong>1926 World Series</strong> was the <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">championship series</a> of the <a href="1926_Major_League_Baseball_season" title="wikilink">1926</a> <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) season, featuring the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> against the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>. The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the best-of-seven series, which took place from October 2 to October 10, 1926 at <a href="Yankee_Stadium" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> and <a href="Sportsman&#39;s_Park" title="wikilink">Sportsman's Park</a>.</p>
<p>The Cardinals and Yankees earned their places in the series by having the best win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss records in the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National</a> and <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American Leagues</a>, respectively. This was the first World Series appearance for the Cardinals&lt;U+2014&gt;the first of 10 World Series championships in Cardinals history. The Yankees were making their fourth World Series appearance in six seasons;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> after this series, they would play in another 35 World Series.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In Game 1, pitcher <a href="Herb_Pennock" title="wikilink">Herb Pennock</a> led the Yankees to a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win over the Cardinals. In Game 2, pitcher <a href="Grover_Cleveland_Alexander" title="wikilink">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a> evened the Series for the Cardinals with a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory. Cardinals pitcher <a href="Jesse_Haines" title="wikilink">Jesse Haines</a> threw a <a href="complete_game" title="wikilink">complete game</a> <a href="shutout" class="uri" title="wikilink">shutout</a> in Game 3, which gave St. Louis a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 series lead. In the Yankees 10&lt;U+2013&gt;5 victory in Game 4, <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a> hit three <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, a World Series record equaled only twice since. According to newspaper reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to hit a home run for him in Game 4. After Ruth's three-home run performance, the boy's condition had miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock was again the winning pitcher for the Yankees in the team's 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory in Game 5.</p>
<p>The Yankees led the series 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2, and Cardinals player-manager <a href="Rogers_Hornsby" title="wikilink">Rogers Hornsby</a> chose Alexander as the starting pitcher in Game 6 and used him as a <a href="relief_pitcher" title="wikilink">relief pitcher</a> in Game 7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won the final two games of the series, thus giving them the championship. In Game 7, the Yankees were losing 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 in the bottom of the ninth <a href="Innings#Baseball" title="wikilink">inning</a>, their last opportunity to score in a <a href="extra_innings" title="wikilink">regular game</a>. Ruth <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walked</a> with two <a href="out_(baseball)" title="wikilink">outs</a>. <a href="Bob_Meusel" title="wikilink">Bob Meusel</a> came to bat next, but Ruth, who had a 50% career success rate at <a href="stolen_base" title="wikilink">stealing bases</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> decided to try stealing <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second base</a>.

This was the first World Series appearance in Cardinals team history.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The contest for first place in the National League was heated. During the second and third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi-game <a href="Winning_streak_(sports)" title="wikilink">winning streaks</a> and swapped positions in the league standings for win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record on a daily basis.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> On September 17, the Cardinals went one game ahead of the Reds and continued building their lead in the standings in the coming days as the Reds lost several games in a row. The Cardinals concluded the season with a loss to the Reds on September 26, but still finished two games ahead in the <a href="Template:1926_National_League_Standings" title="wikilink">final league standings</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The Yankees had the best record in the American League with 91 wins and 63 losses, finishing three games ahead of the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> They improved on their 69-win season in 1925 by making <a href="Lou_Gehrig" title="wikilink">Lou Gehrig</a> their permanent starting first baseman and trading for <a href="rookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">rookie</a> second baseman <a href="Tony_Lazzeri" title="wikilink">Tony Lazzeri</a> in the offseason. Gehrig, Lazzeri, <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a> and <a href="Earle_Combs" title="wikilink">Earle Combs</a> led the offense. Yankee pitchers <a href="Herb_Pennock" title="wikilink">Herb Pennock</a> and <a href="Urban_Shocker" title="wikilink">Urban Shocker</a> combined for 42 wins in the season. The Yankees were making their fourth World Series appearance in six years; they had previously won the World Series in <a href="1923_World_Series" title="wikilink">1923</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In early September 1926, thousands of <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> fans, confident that their team would win the American League pennant despite being six games behind the Yankees, filed requests to reserve World Series tickets.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By September 2, the Indians were two games behind the Yankees, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind them.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 11, <a href="Baseball_Commissioner" title="wikilink">Commissioner of Baseball</a> <a href="Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" title="wikilink">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> met with representatives from four of the top teams in the American and National Leagues.

Landis and the representatives also agreed that each game was to start at 13:30 local time.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Some <a href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmakers</a> named the Yankees a 15-to-1 favorite to win the World Series over the Cardinals, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> One writer from <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> claimed that &quot;there is little justification for installing either team as favorite&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Regardless of the odds, players from both teams expressed confidence regarding their team's chances of winning the championship.

<p>The game was <a href="rain_delay" title="wikilink">rain delayed</a> for 30 minutes during the top half of the fourth inning. Once the game resumed, the Cardinals came to bat and scored the first runs of the game. Les Bell, a .325 hitter with 17 home runs that season, led the Cardinals with a single to <a href="center_field" title="wikilink">center field</a>. Chick Hafey dropped a sacrifice bunt straight to Ruether, who then threw it to second baseman Tony Lazzeri. Bell beat Lazzeri's tag at second base and was called <a href="safe_(baseball)" title="wikilink">safe</a> by the <a href="umpire_(baseball)" title="wikilink">umpire</a>. Bob O'Farrell was <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walked</a>, and Tommy Thevenow hit a grounder to Lazzeri, who tossed it to Mark Koenig for the force out at second base. Koenig tagged O'Farrell out, but made an error in his throw to first baseman Lou Gehrig, which resulted in a run. Then, Haines hit a Ruether pitch for a two-run home run.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals were leading the Yankees 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 by the end of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home following a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak <a href="batted_ball" title="wikilink">infield groundouts</a>. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher <a href="Myles_Thomas" title="wikilink">Myles Thomas</a> came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a <a href="line_drive" title="wikilink">line drive</a> single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game <a href="shutout#Baseball" title="wikilink">shutout</a>, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Future Baseball Hall of Famer <a href="Waite_Hoyt" title="wikilink">Waite Hoyt</a> started Game 4 for the Yankees at Sportsman's Park on October 6, 1926. Hoyt had a 16&lt;U+2013&gt;12 record with a 3.85 ERA in 218 innings for the 1926 season. This was Hoyt's fourth World Series with the New York Yankees, and he entered the 1926 Series with over 35 innings of pitching experience in the championship series.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He was opposed by <a href="Flint_Rhem" title="wikilink">Flint Rhem</a>, the Cardinals' 20-game winner who had led the team with both a .741 winning percentage and 258 innings pitched.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Ruth1921.jpg" title="fig:Babe Ruth in 1921" alt="Babe Ruth in 1921" /> In the first inning, after striking out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem gave up a solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came into the bottom of the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals responded by scoring three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell followed and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed <a href="infielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">infielder</a> <a href="Specs_Toporczer" title="wikilink">Specs Toporczer</a> to <a href="pinch_hitter" title="wikilink">pinch-hit</a> for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly <a href="tag_up" title="wikilink">tagged up</a> to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>To start the top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and followed by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping the bases loaded with no outs. <a href="Hi_Bell" title="wikilink">Hi Bell</a> replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but he was not able to suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then <a href="balk" title="wikilink">balked</a>, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walked</a>, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a <a href="force_play" title="wikilink">force play</a> at second base.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The Yankees expanded on their three-run lead in the next inning. After the entire Yankees <a href="batting_order_(baseball)" title="wikilink">lineup</a> batted in the fifth inning, Combs was back at the plate to start the sixth. Combs hit an infield single past shortstop Thevenow. Koenig followed by striking out. Ruth, with two home runs already in the game, came up to the plate. The <a href="count_(baseball)" title="wikilink">count</a> on Ruth went up to <a href="full_count" title="wikilink">three balls and two strikes</a> before he hit a long home run. Ruth's three home runs was a feat equaled again by Ruth in 1928, and by Yankees slugger <a href="Reggie_Jackson" title="wikilink">Reggie Jackson</a> in <a href="1977_World_Series" title="wikilink">1977</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> As one of the game <a href="Sportscaster" title="wikilink">announcers</a> (either McNamee or Carlin)<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> described the situation:</p>

<p>In the seventh inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time a southpaw named <a href="Bill_Hallahan" title="wikilink">Bill Hallahan</a>, who served as both a starter and reliever for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10&lt;U+2013&gt;4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to <a href="center_fielder" title="wikilink">center field</a>. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game 5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="babe-ruth-and-johnny-sylvester">Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester</h4>
<p>The 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from <a href="Essex_Fells,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Essex Fells</a>, <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an <a href="airmail" class="uri" title="wikilink">airmail</a> package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, &quot;I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> After Ruth hit three home runs in Game 4 on Wednesday, October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, &quot;I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, &quot;Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>There have been many alternate versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in the <em><a href="The_Babe_Ruth_Story" title="wikilink">The Babe Ruth Story</a></em>, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would &quot;try to knock you another homer, maybe two today&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from <a href="sepsis" title="wikilink">blood poisoning</a>, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a <a href="spinal_fusion" title="wikilink">spinal fusion</a>. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="game-5">Game 5</h3>
<p><img src="Pennock.jpg" title="fig:Yankees pitcher Herb Pennock on a 1922 baseball card" alt="Yankees pitcher Herb Pennock on a 1922 baseball card" /> Thursday, October 7, 1926 at <a href="Sportsman&#39;s_Park" title="wikilink">Sportsman's Park III</a> in <a href="St_Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St Louis, Missouri</a> </p>
<p>Game 5, played at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis on October 7, featured a rematch between Game 1 starters Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. Pennock had pitched a <a href="complete_game" title="wikilink">complete game</a> three-hitter in the 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 Yankees victory, while Sherdel had pitched seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Through the first three innings of the fourth game, both pitchers held the opposing team to no runs and a limited number of hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in <a href="foul_territory" title="wikilink">foul territory</a> by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a <a href="line_drive" title="wikilink">line drive</a> double into <a href="left_field" title="wikilink">left field</a> past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of <a href="caught_stealing" title="wikilink">picking off</a> Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees lead-off hitter, followed by <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">drawing a walk</a>. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a <a href="sacrifice_fly" title="wikilink">sacrifice fly</a> to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third base</a>. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey <a href="in_flight" title="wikilink">fly out</a>, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, advancing Gehrig to third base. <a href="Ben_Paschal" title="wikilink">Ben Paschal</a> went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the <a href="force_play" title="wikilink">force out</a> on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second base</a>, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into <a href="extra_innings" title="wikilink">extra innings</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>The Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first</a>, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was <a href="intentional_base_on_balls" title="wikilink">intentionally walked</a>, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. <a href="Mike_Gazella" title="wikilink">Mike Gazella</a>, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was <a href="hit_by_pitch" title="wikilink">hit by a pitch</a> from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched 10-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="game-6">Game 6</h3>

<p>The teams moved back to <a href="Yankee_Stadium" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> for Game 6. Over 48,000 fans came into Yankee Stadium on October 9 to see if the Yankees could win their second World Series in franchise history. The game's pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals' Game 2 victory.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;7 record with a 3.62 earned run average.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>The game was lopsided from the start. In the top of the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triple</a> into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees for the rest of the inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 lead. In the top of the fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in <a href="tag_up" title="wikilink">advancing</a> Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander <a href="bunt_(baseball)" title="wikilink">bunted</a> right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an <a href="error_(baseball)" title="wikilink">error</a> on the play, and both runners were safe at their respective bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game 2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' lead to 9&lt;U+2013&gt;1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to seven runs.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>In the eighth inning, Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two <a href="earned_run" title="wikilink">unearned runs</a> in less than an inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an <a href="run_batted_in" title="wikilink">RBI</a> groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee <a href="pitcher" title="wikilink">pitchers</a> combined to give up 13 hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>The deciding Game 7 was played on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 38,093 people. The game featured two future <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Famers</a>, who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series. Jesse Haines took to the mound for the Cardinals; he had pitched in relief in Game 1 and threw a complete game <a href="shutout#Baseball" title="wikilink">shutout</a> against the Yankees in Game 3. Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete game 10&lt;U+2013&gt;5 Yankees victory in Game 4.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Haines struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.</p>
<p>In the sixth inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid followed with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game 1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Rogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the day before and may have spent the night drinking,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he &quot;had it in easy in there&quot; in Game 6<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left field line. The ball initially appeared to be going into the stands for a <a href="Grand_slam_(baseball)" title="wikilink">grand slam</a>, but at the last minute, it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Alexander then threw a fastball that Lazzeri swung late at and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees' threat.</p>
<p>Alexander <a href="List_of_baseball_jargon_(O)#one-two-three_inning" title="wikilink">retired the Yankees in order</a> in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to preserve the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next pitch fell outside of the <a href="strike_zone" title="wikilink">strike zone</a> for ball one. Ruth then <a href="foul_ball" title="wikilink">fouled</a> the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a <a href="full_count" title="wikilink">full count</a>.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The following full count pitch was noted by <em><a href="New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="wikilink">New York Herald Tribune</a></em> <a href="sports_journalism" title="wikilink">sportswriter</a> <a href="W._O._McGeehan" title="wikilink">W. O. McGeehan</a>: &quot;The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first.&quot;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>With two outs and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the plate. Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81 runs in just over 100 <a href="season_(sports)" title="wikilink">regular season</a> games. Meusel also had success in Game 6 against Alexander, with a double and triple.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to <a href="stolen_base" title="wikilink">steal</a> second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly aggressive <a href="baserunning" title="wikilink">baserunner</a>, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Meusel swung and missed at the pitch, and Cardinals <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a> Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to <a href="second_base" title="wikilink">second baseman</a> Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. Ruth was called out, and the game was over. As the game announcer described it, &quot;Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel. Going down to second! The game is over! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second!&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>As Hornsby recalled later, Ruth &quot;didn't say a word. He didn't even look around or up at me. He just picked himself up and walked away&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Ruth's <a href="caught_stealing" title="wikilink">failed attempt to steal second base</a> ended the game and the 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2008, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals went back home to St. Louis to a rapturous fan reception, having won their first World Series championship. Each member of the championship team collected $5,584.51, while the Yankees' players were given $3,417.75 each.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
