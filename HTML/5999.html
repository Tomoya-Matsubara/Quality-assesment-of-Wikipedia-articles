<p>Wilde was born into an <a href="Anglo-Irish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish</a> family, at 21 Westland Row, <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, to Sir <a href="William_Wilde" title="wikilink">William Wilde</a> and his wife <a href="Jane_Wilde" title="wikilink">Jane Francesca Elgee</a>. Jane was a successful writer and an Irish <a href="nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a>, known also as 'Speranza', while Sir William was Ireland's leading ear and eye surgeon, and wrote books on <a href="archaeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeology</a> and <a href="folklore" class="uri" title="wikilink">folklore</a>. He was a renowned philanthropist, and his dispensary for the care of the city's poor, in <a href="Lincoln_Place" title="wikilink">Lincoln Place</a> at the rear of <a href="Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road.</p>
<p>In June 1855, the family moved to 1 <a href="Merrion_Square" title="wikilink">Merrion Square</a>, in a fashionable residential area. Here, Lady Wilde held a regular Saturday afternoon <a href="Salon_(gathering)" title="wikilink">salon</a> with guests including <a href="Sheridan_le_Fanu" title="wikilink">Sheridan le Fanu</a>, <a href="Samuel_Lever" title="wikilink">Samuel Lever</a>, <a href="George_Petrie" title="wikilink">George Petrie</a>, <a href="Isaac_Butt" title="wikilink">Isaac Butt</a> and <a href="Samuel_Ferguson" title="wikilink">Samuel Ferguson</a>. Oscar was educated at home up to the age of nine. He attended <a href="Portora_Royal_School" title="wikilink">Portora Royal School</a> in <a href="Enniskillen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enniskillen</a>, <a href="County_Fermanagh" title="wikilink">Fermanagh</a> from 1864 to 1871, spending the summer months with his family in rural <a href="County_Waterford" title="wikilink">Waterford</a>, <a href="County_Wexford" title="wikilink">Wexford</a> and at Sir William's family home in <a href="County_Mayo" title="wikilink">Mayo</a>. Here the Wilde brothers played with the young <a href="George_Moore_(novelist)" title="wikilink">George Moore</a>.</p>
<p>After leaving Portora, Wilde studied classics at <a href="Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, from 1871 to 1874. He was an outstanding student, and won the <a href="Berkeley_Gold_Medal" title="wikilink">Berkeley Gold Medal</a>, the highest award available to <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a> students at Trinity. He was granted a <a href="scholarship" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholarship</a> to <a href="Magdalen_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Magdalen College, Oxford</a>, where he continued his studies from 1874 to 1878 and where he became a part of the Aesthetic movement, one of its tenets being to make an art of life. While at Magdalen, he won the 1878 <a href="Newdigate_Prize" title="wikilink">Newdigate Prize</a> for his poem <em>Ravenna</em>, which he read out at <a href="Encaenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Encaenia</a>; he failed, though, to win the Chancellor's English Essay Prize for an essay that would be published posthumously as <em>The Rise of Historical Criticism</em> (1909). In November 1878, he graduated with a <a href="British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First_Class_Honours" title="wikilink">double first</a> in classical moderations and <em><a href="literae_humaniores" title="wikilink">literae humaniores</a></em>, or 'greats'.</p>
<h3 id="marriage-and-family">Marriage and family</h3>
<p>After graduating from Magdalen, Wilde returned to Dublin, where he met and fell in love with <a href="Florence_Balcombe" title="wikilink">Florence Balcombe</a>. She in turn became engaged to <a href="Bram_Stoker" title="wikilink">Bram Stoker</a>. On hearing of her engagement, Wilde wrote to her stating his intention to leave <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> permanently. He left in 1878 and was to return to his native country only twice, for brief visits. The next six years were spent in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, where he travelled to deliver lectures. Wilde's address in the 1881 <a href="Census_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Census</a> is given as 1 Tite Street, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. The head of the household is listed as Frank Miles.</p>
<p>In London, he met Constance Lloyd, daughter of wealthy <a href="Queen&#39;s_Counsel" title="wikilink">Queen's Counsel</a> <a href="Horace_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Horace Lloyd</a>. She was visiting Dublin in 1884, when Oscar was in the city to give lectures at the <a href="Gaiety_Theatre" title="wikilink">Gaiety Theatre</a>. He proposed to her and they married on <a href="May_29" title="wikilink">May 29</a>, <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a> in <a href="Paddington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paddington</a>, London. Constance's allowance of &lt;U+00A3&gt;250 allowed the Wildes to live in relative luxury. The couple had two sons, <a href="Cyril_Holland" title="wikilink">Cyril</a> (1885) and <a href="Vyvyan_Holland" title="wikilink">Vyvyan</a> (1886). After Oscar's downfall, Constance took the surname Holland for herself and the boys. She died in 1898 following spinal surgery and was buried in Staglieno Cemetery in <a href="Genoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genoa</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. Cyril was killed in France in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. Vyvyan survived the war and went on to become an author and translator. He published his memoirs in 1954. Vyvyan's son, <a href="Merlin_Holland" title="wikilink">Merlin Holland</a>, has edited and published several works about his grandfather. Oscar Wilde's niece, <a href="Dolly_Wilde" title="wikilink">Dolly Wilde</a>, was involved in a lengthy <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> affair with writer <a href="Natalie_Clifford_Barney" title="wikilink">Natalie Clifford Barney</a>.</p>
<h3 id="aestheticism">Aestheticism</h3>
<p><img src="Wasp_cartoon_on_Oscar_Wilde.jpg" title="fig:Keller cartoon from the Wasp of San Francisco depicting Wilde on the occasion of his visit there in 1882." alt="Keller cartoon from the Wasp of San Francisco depicting Wilde on the occasion of his visit there in 1882." /> While at Magdalen College, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the <a href="aesthetic_movement" title="wikilink">aesthetic</a> and <a href="decadent_movement" title="wikilink">decadent movements</a>. He began wearing his hair long and openly scorning so-called &quot;manly&quot; sports, and began decorating his rooms with <a href="peacock" class="uri" title="wikilink">peacock</a> feathers, lilies, <a href="sunflowers" class="uri" title="wikilink">sunflowers</a>, blue china and other <em><a href="work_of_art" title="wikilink">objets d'art</a></em>.</p>
<p>Legends persist that his behaviour cost him a dunking in the <a href="River_Cherwell" title="wikilink">River Cherwell</a> in addition to having his rooms (which still survive as student accommodation at his old college) trashed, but the cult spread among certain segments of society to such an extent that languishing attitudes, &quot;too-too&quot; costumes and <a href="aestheticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">aestheticism</a> generally became a recognised pose.</p>
<p>Aestheticism in general was caricatured in <a href="Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s <a href="operetta" class="uri" title="wikilink">operetta</a> <em><a href="Patience_(operetta)" title="wikilink">Patience</a> (1881)</em>. Such was the success of <em>Patience</em> in New York that <a href="Richard_D&#39;Oyly_Carte" title="wikilink">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a> invited Wilde to America for a lecture tour. This was duly arranged, Wilde arriving on 3 January 1882, aboard the SS Arizona . Wilde is reputed to have told a customs officer &quot;I have nothing to declare except my genius&quot;, although there is no contemporary evidence for the remark. D'Oyly Carte used Wilde's lecture tour &quot;to prime the pump&quot; for an American tour of <em>Patience</em>, making sure that the ticket-buying public was aware of his personality.</p>
<p>Wilde was deeply impressed by the English writers <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a> and <a href="Walter_Pater" title="wikilink">Walter Pater</a>, who argued for the central importance of <a href="art" class="uri" title="wikilink">art</a> in life. He later commented <a href="irony" title="wikilink">ironically</a> on this view when he wrote, in <em><a href="The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray" title="wikilink">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>,</em> &quot;All art is quite useless.&quot; Wilde was associated with the phrase <a href="Art_for_art&#39;s_sake" title="wikilink">Art for art's sake</a>, though it appears nowhere in his writings: it was coined by the philosopher <a href="Victor_Cousin" title="wikilink">Victor Cousin</a>, promoted by <a href="Theophile_Gautier" title="wikilink">Theophile Gautier</a> and brought into prominence by <a href="James_McNeill_Whistler" title="wikilink">James McNeill Whistler</a>.</p>
<p>The aesthetic movement, represented by the school of <a href="William_Morris" title="wikilink">William Morris</a> and <a href="Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti" title="wikilink">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, had a permanent influence on English decorative art. As the leading aesthete in Britain, Wilde became one of the most prominent personalities of his day. Though he was sometimes ridiculed for them, his <a href="paradox" title="wikilink">paradoxes</a> and witty sayings were quoted on all sides.</p>
<p>In 1879 Wilde started to teach Aesthetic values in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. In 1882 he went on a lecture tour in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. He was torn apart by no small number of critics — <em>The Wasp</em>, a <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> newspaper, published a cartoon ridiculing Wilde and Aestheticism — but also was surprisingly well received in such rough-and-tumble settings as the <a href="mining" class="uri" title="wikilink">mining</a> town of <a href="Leadville,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Leadville, Colorado</a>. <a href="http://www.todayinliterature.com/stories.asp?Event_Date=12/24/1881">1</a> On his return to the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, he worked as a reviewer for the <em><a href="Pall_Mall_Gazette" title="wikilink">Pall Mall Gazette</a></em> in the years 1887-1889. Afterwards he became the editor of <em>Woman's World</em>.</p>
<p>Politically, Wilde endorsed an <a href="anarchist" title="wikilink">anarchistic</a> brand of <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>, expounding his beliefs in the text &quot;<a href="The_Soul_of_Man_under_Socialism" title="wikilink">The Soul of Man under Socialism</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>In 1881 he published a selection of his poems, but these attracted admiration in only a limited circle. His most famous fairy tale, <em><a href="The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales" title="wikilink">The Happy Prince and Other Tales</a></em>, appeared in 1888, illustrated by <a href="Walter_Crane" title="wikilink">Walter Crane</a> and <a href="Jacob_Hood" title="wikilink">Jacob Hood</a>. This volume was followed by a second collection of fairy tales, <em><a href="A_House_of_Pomegranates" title="wikilink">A House of Pomegranates</a></em> (1892), which the author said was &quot;intended neither for the British child nor the British public.&quot;</p>
<p>His only novel, <em><a href="The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray" title="wikilink">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em>, was published in 1891. Critics have often claimed that there existed parallels between Wilde's life and that of the book's protagonist, and it was used as evidence against him at his trial. Wilde contributed some feature articles to the art reviews, and in 1891 re-published four of them as a book called <em>Intentions</em>, upon which his reputation as a critic rests.</p>
<p>His fame as a dramatist began with the production of <em><a href="Lady_Windermere&#39;s_Fan" title="wikilink">Lady Windermere's Fan</a></em> in February 1892. This was written at the request of <a href="George_Alexander" title="wikilink">George Alexander</a>, actor-manager of the <a href="St_James&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">St James's Theatre</a> in London. Wilde described it as &quot;one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades&quot;. It was immediately successful, the author making the enormous sum of 7,000 pounds from the original run. He wore a green carnation on opening night. In 1894, the <a href="Robert_S_Hichens" title="wikilink">Robert Hichens</a> novel <em><a href="The_Green_Carnation" title="wikilink">The Green Carnation</a></em>, said to be based on the relationship of Wilde and <a href="Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="wikilink">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>, was published. It would be one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials the following year.</p>
<p>Less successful in 1892 was the play <em><a href="Salom&lt;U+00E9&gt;_(play)" title="wikilink">Salom&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a></em>, which was refused a licence for English performance by the <a href="Lord_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Lord Chamberlain</a> because it contained Biblical characters. Wilde was furious, even contemplating (he said) changing his nationality to become a French citizen. The play was published in English, with illustrations by <a href="Aubrey_Beardsley" title="wikilink">Aubrey Beardsley</a>, in 1894. A French edition had appeared the year before.</p>
<p>His next play, a social satire and melodrama, was <em><a href="A_Woman_of_No_Importance" title="wikilink">A Woman of No Importance</a></em>, produced on <a href="19_April" title="wikilink">19 April</a> 1893 at the <a href="Haymarket_Theatre" title="wikilink">Haymarket Theatre</a> in London by <a href="Herbert_Beerbohm_Tree" title="wikilink">Herbert Beerbohm Tree</a>. It repeated the success of <em>Lady Windermere's Fan</em>, consolidating Wilde's reputation as the best writer of &quot;<a href="comedy_of_manners" title="wikilink">comedy of manners</a>&quot; since <a href="Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>.</p>
<p>A slightly more serious note was again struck with <em><a href="An_Ideal_Husband" title="wikilink">An Ideal Husband</a></em>, produced by <a href="Lewis_Waller" title="wikilink">Lewis Waller</a> at the Haymarket Theatre on <a href="3_January" title="wikilink">3 January</a>, <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a>. This contains a political melodrama — as opposed to the marital melodrama of the earlier comedies — running alongside the usual Wildean <a href="epigrams" class="uri" title="wikilink">epigrams</a>, <a href="social_commentary" title="wikilink">social commentary</a>, <a href="comedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">comedy</a>, and <a href="romantic_love" title="wikilink">romance</a>. <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s review said that &quot;...Mr Wilde is to me our only serious playwright. He plays with everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors, with audience, with the whole theatre...&quot;</p>
<p>Barely a month later, his masterpiece <em><a href="The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest" title="wikilink">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em> appeared at the <a href="St_James&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">St James's Theatre</a>. It caused a sensation. Years later, the actor <a href="Allen_Aynesworth" title="wikilink">Allen Aynesworth</a> (playing 'Algy' opposite <a href="George_Alexander" title="wikilink">George Alexander</a>'s 'Jack') told Wilde's biographer <a href="Hesketh_Pearson" title="wikilink">Hesketh Pearson</a> that &quot;In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than the first night of 'The Importance of Being Earnest'.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike the three previous comedies, <em>Earnest</em> is free of any melodrama; it brought irony, satire and verbal wit to English drama. Yet it follows an unusually clever plotline, where alter egos abound among false identities, mistaken identities and imaginative romantic liaisons. This 'comedy of manners' is a perfect example of Wilde's theory on Art: <em>Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art</em>. At least two versions of the play are in existence. Wilde originally wrote it in four acts, but George Alexander proposed to cut it down to three for the original production.</p>
<p>In between <em>An Ideal Husband</em> and <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, Wilde wrote at least the scenario for a play concerning an adulterous affair. He never developed it, the Queensberry affair and his own trial intervening. <a href="Frank_Harris" title="wikilink">Frank Harris</a> eventually wrote a version called <em>Mr and Mrs Daventry</em>.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that in 1894, Wilde wrote another little-known play (in the form of a pantomime) for a friend of his, Chan Toon, which was called <em><a href="For_Love_of_the_King" title="wikilink">For Love of the King</a></em> and also went under the name <em><a href="A_Burmese_Masque" title="wikilink">A Burmese Masque</a></em>. It has never been widely circulated. One copy, held in the <a href="University_of_Leeds#Facilities" title="wikilink">Leeds University Library's</a> Fay and Geoffrey Elliott Collection, is marked: &quot;This is a spurious work attributed to Wilde without authority by a Mrs. Chan Toon, who was sent to prison for stealing money from her landlady. A.J.A. Symons.&quot; (15, <em><a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/handlists/148Elliott.pdf">Handlist 148</a></em>, <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/listndex.htm">Leeds handlists index</a>)</p>
<h3 id="wildes-sexuality">Wilde's sexuality</h3>
<p><img src="Robert_Ross_at_24.jpg" title="fig:Robert Ross at twenty-four" alt="Robert Ross at twenty-four" /> Though Wilde's <a href="sexual_orientation" title="wikilink">sexual orientation</a> has variously been considered <a href="Bisexuality" title="wikilink">bisexual</a>, <a href="Homosexuality" title="wikilink">homosexual</a>, and <a href="Pederasty" title="wikilink">pederastic</a>, Wilde himself felt he belonged to a culture of male love inspired by the <a href="Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek pederastic tradition</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In describing his own sexual identity, Wilde used the term <em>Socratic</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His most significant sexual relationships appear to have been (in chronological order) with (perhaps) <a href="Frank_Miles" title="wikilink">Frank Miles</a>, <a href="Constance_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Constance Lloyd</a> (Wilde's wife), <a href="Robert_Baldwin_Ross" title="wikilink">Robert Baldwin Ross</a>, and <a href="Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="wikilink">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>. Wilde also had numerous sexual encounters with working-class male youths, who were often <a href="rent_boys" title="wikilink">rent boys</a>.</p>
<p>Biographers generally believe Wilde was introduced to homosexuality in 1885 (the year after his wedding) by the 17-year-old Robert Baldwin Ross. Neil McKenna's biography <em>The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde</em> (2003) theorizes that Wilde was aware of his homosexuality much earlier, from the moment of his first kiss with another boy at the age of 16. According to McKenna, after arriving at Oxford in 1874, Wilde tentatively explored his sexuality, discovering that he could feel passionate romantic love for &quot;fair, slim&quot; choirboys, but was more sexually drawn towards the swarthy young <a href="male_prostitute" title="wikilink">rough trade</a>. By the late 1870s, Wilde was already preoccupied with the philosophy of same-sex love, and had befriended a group of <a href="Uranian_poetry" title="wikilink">Uranian (pederastic) poets</a> and homosexual law reformers, becoming acquainted with the work of gay-rights pioneer <a href="Karl-Heinrich_Ulrichs" title="wikilink">Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs</a>. Wilde also met <a href="Walt_Whitman" title="wikilink">Walt Whitman</a> in America in 1882, writing to a friend that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; about the great American poet's sexual orientation &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips,&quot; he boasted. He even lived with the society painter Frank Miles, who was a few years his senior and may have been his lover. However, writes McKenna, he was unhappy with the direction of his sexual and romantic desires, and, hoping that marriage would cure him, he married Constance Lloyd in 1884. McKenna's account has been criticized by some reviewers who find it too speculative, although not necessarily implausible.<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1070373,00.html">2</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not Wilde was still na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve when he first met Ross, Ross did play an important role in the development of Wilde's understanding of his own sexuality. Ross was aware of Wilde's poems before they met, and indeed had been beaten for reading them. He was also unmoved by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality. By Richard Ellmann's account, Ross, &quot;...so young and yet so knowing, was determined to seduce Wilde.&quot; Later, Ross boasted to Lord Alfred Douglas that he was &quot;the first boy Oscar ever had&quot; and there seems to have been much jealousy between them. Soon, Wilde entered a world of regular sex with youths such as servants and newsboys, in their mid to late teens, whom he would meet in homosexual bars or brothels. In Wilde's words, the relations were akin to &quot;feasting with panthers&quot;, and he revelled in the risk: &quot;the danger was half the excitement.&quot; In his public writings, Wilde's first celebration of romantic love between men and boys can be found in <em>The Portrait of Mr. W. H.</em> (1889), in which he propounds a theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of Elizabethan boy actor &quot;<a href="William_Hughes_(Mr._W._H.)" title="wikilink">Willie Hughes</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1891 he was introduced by the poet <a href="Lionel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Lionel Johnson</a> to the twenty-two-year-old Lord Alfred Douglas, an undergraduate at Oxford at the time. An intimate friendship immediately sprang up between the two, but it was not initially sexual nor did the sexuality progress far when it did eventually take place. According to Douglas, speaking in his old age, for the first six months their relations remained on a purely intellectual and emotional level. despite of the fact that &quot;from the second time he saw me, when he gave me a copy of <em>Dorian Grey</em> which I took with me to Oxford he made overtures to me. It was not till I had known him for at least six months and after I had seen him over and over again and he had twice stayed with me in Oxford, that I gave in to him. I did with him and allowed him to do just what was done among boys at Winchester and Oxford . . . Sodomy never took place between us, nor was it attempted or dreamed of. Wilde treated me as an older one does a younger one at school.&quot; After Wilde realized that Douglas only consented in order to please him, as his instincts drew him not to men but to younger boys, Wilde permanently ceased his physical attentions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>For a few years they lived together more or less openly in a number of locations. Wilde and some within his upper-class social group also began to speak about homosexual law reform, and their commitment to &quot;The Cause&quot; was formalised by the founding of a highly secretive organisation called the <a href="Order_of_Chaeronea" title="wikilink">Order of Chaeronea</a>, of which Wilde was a member. A homosexual novel, <em><a href="Teleny_or_The_Reverse_of_the_Medal" title="wikilink">Teleny or The Reverse of the Medal</a></em>, written at about the same time and clandestinely published in 1893, has been attributed to Oscar Wilde, but was probably, in fact, a combined effort by a number of Wilde's friends, which Wilde edited. Wilde also periodically contributed to the <a href="Uranian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranian</a> literary journal <em>The Chameleon</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-queensberry-scandal">The Queensberry scandal</h3>
<p><img src="Homosexualitywilde.jpg" title="fig:Lord Alfred Douglas and Oscar Wilde." alt="Lord Alfred Douglas and Oscar Wilde." /> In 1891, Wilde became intimate with <a href="Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="wikilink">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>, nicknamed &quot;Bosie&quot;. Lord Alfred's first mentor had been his cosmopolitan and effeminate grandfather Alfred Montgomery. His older brother <a href="Francis_Douglas,_Viscount_Drumlanrig" title="wikilink">Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig</a> also had an association with the Prime Minister <a href="Archibald_Philip_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery" title="wikilink">Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery</a>, which ended with Francis's death, a possible suicide. Lord Alfred's father <a href="John_Sholto_Douglas,_9th_Marquess_of_Queensberry" title="wikilink">John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry</a> came to believe his sons had been corrupted by older homosexuals, or as he phrased it in a letter, &quot;Snob Queers like Rosebery&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As he had attempted to do with Rosebery, Queensberry confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred on several occasions, but each time Wilde was able to mollify him.</p>
<p>However, on the opening night of <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> Queensberry planned to insult Wilde with the delivery of a bouquet of vegetables. Wilde was tipped off, and Queensberry was barred from entering the theatre. On <a href="February_18" title="wikilink">February 18</a>, <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a>, the Marquess left a calling card at one of Wilde's clubs, the Albemarle. On the back of the card he wrote &quot;For Oscar Wilde posing as a <a href="Somdomite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somdomite</a>&quot; (a misspelling of '<a href="Sodomite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sodomite</a>').</p>
<p>Although Wilde's friends advised him to ignore the insult, Lord Alfred encouraged Wilde to charge his father with criminal <a href="libel" class="uri" title="wikilink">libel</a>. Queensberry was arrested, and in April 1895, the Crown took over the prosecution of the libel case against him. The trial lasted three days. The prosecuting counsel, Edward Clarke, was unaware of Wilde's previous liaisons with other males. Clarke asked Wilde directly whether there was any substance to Queensberry's accusations. Wilde denied that there was. However, Queensberry's barrister <a href="Edward_Carson" title="wikilink">Edward Carson</a> hired investigators who were able to locate a number of youths with whom Wilde had been involved, either socially or sexually, such as the 16-year-old Walter Grainger and other newsboys and valets. Most damaging of all, among them were a number of young men who had earned money through prostitution, including one of the main witnesses, Charles Parker.</p>
<p>Wilde acquitted himself well on the first day of the trial, parrying Carson's cross-examination on the morals of his published works with wit and sarcasm, that brought laughter to the courtroom. Asked whether he had ever adored any man younger than himself, Wilde replied, &quot;I have never given adoration to anybody except myself.&quot; However, on the second day, Carson's cross-examination was much more damaging: Wilde later admitted to perjuring himself with some of his answers. On the third day, Clarke recommended that Wilde withdraw the prosecution, and the case was dismissed.</p>
<p>The authorities were unwilling to let matters rest. Based on the evidence acquired by Queensberry and Carson, Wilde was arrested on <a href="April_6" title="wikilink">April 6</a> <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a> at the <a href="Cadogan_Hotel" title="wikilink">Cadogan Hotel</a>, London, and charged with &quot;committing acts of <a href="sodomy_law" title="wikilink">gross indecency</a> with other male persons&quot; under Section 11 of the 1885 <a href="Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act" title="wikilink">Criminal Law Amendment Act</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; an event later immortalised by the <a href="poet_laureate" title="wikilink">poet laureate</a> <a href="John_Betjeman" title="wikilink">John Betjeman</a> in a poem <em>The arrest of Oscar Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel</em>. Despite pleas by friends to flee the country, Wilde chose to stay and <a href="martyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyr</a> himself for his cause. Clarke offered to defend him <a href="pro_bono" title="wikilink">pro bono</a> at his upcoming trial.</p>
<h3 id="trial-and-imprisonment-in-reading-gaol">Trial and imprisonment in Reading Gaol</h3>
<p>Wilde brought suit against <a href="Lord_Alfred_Douglas" title="wikilink">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>'s father, the ninth <a href="Marquess_of_Queensberry" title="wikilink">Marquess of Queensberry</a>, for sending him a libelous note. However, it was Wilde who was forced to act defensively at the trial because <a href="sodomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">sodomy</a> was a crime in late Victorian England and this first trial led to two others (the latter two against Wilde). While Wilde did not speak directly for same-sex love in his trials, he nevertheless defended it eloquently:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Gill: What is &quot;the love that dares not speak its name?&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Wilde: &quot;The love that dares not speak its name&quot; in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between <a href="David_and_Jonathan" title="wikilink">David and Jonathan</a>, such as <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a> made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of <a href="Michelangelo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michelangelo</a> and <a href="Shakespeare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a>. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as 'the love that dares not speak its name', and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when the older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the <a href="pillory" class="uri" title="wikilink">pillory</a> for it.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. The next, and last, trial was presided over by Chief Justice Sir <a href="Alfred_Wills" title="wikilink">Alfred Wills</a>. On <a href="May_25" title="wikilink">May 25</a>, <a href="1895" class="uri" title="wikilink">1895</a> Wilde was convicted of gross <a href="indecency" class="uri" title="wikilink">indecency</a> and sentenced to two years' hard labour. His conviction angered some observers, one of whom demanded, in a published letter, &quot;Why does not the Crown prosecute every boy at a public or private school or half the men in the Universities?&quot; this in reference to the presumed pederastic proclivities of English upperclassmen.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>He was imprisoned first in <a href="Pentonville_(HM_Prison)" title="wikilink">Pentonville</a> and then in <a href="Wandsworth_(HM_Prison)" title="wikilink">Wandsworth</a> prison in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, and finally transferred in November to <a href="Reading_(HM_Prison)" title="wikilink">Reading Prison</a>, some 30 miles west of London. Wilde knew the town of Reading from happier times when boating on the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">Thames</a> and also from visits to the Palmer family, including a tour of the famous <a href="Huntley_&amp;_Palmers" title="wikilink">Huntley &amp; Palmers</a> biscuit factory quite close to the prison.</p>
<p>Now known as prisoner C. 3.3, (which described the fact that he was in block C, floor three, room three) he was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen to write with, but a later governor was more friendly. During his time in prison, Wilde wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas, which he was not allowed to send while still a prisoner, but which he was allowed to take with him at the end of his sentence. On his release, he gave the manuscript to Ross, who may or may not have carried out Wilde's instructions to send a copy to Douglas who, in turn, denied having received it. Ross published a much <a href="wikt:expurgate" title="wikilink">expurgated</a> version of the letter (about a third of it) in 1905 (four years after Wilde's death) with the title <em><a href="De_Profundis" title="wikilink">De Profundis</a></em>, expanding it slightly for an edition of Wilde's collected works in 1908, and then donated it to the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a> on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. In 1949, Wilde's son <a href="Vyvyan_Holland" title="wikilink">Vyvyan Holland</a> published it again, including parts formerly omitted, but relying on a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Its complete and correct publication did not take place until 1962, in <em>The Letters of Oscar Wilde</em>.</p>
<p>The manuscripts of <em><a href="A_Florentine_Tragedy" title="wikilink">A Florentine Tragedy</a></em> and an essay on <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare's</a> sonnets were stolen from his house in 1895. In 1904, a five-act tragedy, <em><a href="The_Duchess_of_Padua" title="wikilink">The Duchess of Padua</a></em>, written by Wilde about 1883 for <a href="Mary_Anderson" title="wikilink">Mary Anderson</a> but not acted by her, was published in German (<em>Die Herzogin von Padua</em>, translated by <a href="Max_Meyerfeld" title="wikilink">Max Meyerfeld</a>) in Berlin.</p>

<p><img src="Perelachaise-Wilde-p1000393.jpg" title="fig:Wilde&#39;s tomb, sculpted by Sir Jacob Epstein, in P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris" alt="Wilde&#39;s tomb, sculpted by Sir Jacob Epstein, in P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris" />Prison was unkind to Wilde's health and after he was released on <a href="May_19" title="wikilink">May 19</a>, <a href="1897" class="uri" title="wikilink">1897</a> he spent his last three years penniless, in self-imposed exile from society and artistic circles. He went under the assumed name of Sebastian Melmoth, after the famously &quot;penetrated&quot; <a href="Sebastian" title="wikilink">Saint Sebastian</a>, who has since become a gay icon, and the devilish central character of his great-uncle <a href="Charles_Robert_Maturin" title="wikilink">Charles Robert Maturin</a>'s <a href="gothic_novel" title="wikilink">gothic novel</a> <em><a href="Melmoth_the_Wanderer" title="wikilink">Melmoth the Wanderer</a></em>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Wilde lost no time in returning to his previous pleasures. According to Douglas, Ross &quot;dragged [him] back to homosexual practices&quot; during the summer of 1897, which they spent together in Berneval. After his release, he also wrote the famous poem <em><a href="The_Ballad_of_Reading_Gaol" title="wikilink">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</a></em>. Wilde spent his last years in the H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel d'Alsace, now known as <a href="L&#39;H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel" class="uri" title="wikilink">L'H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel</a>, in Paris, where he was notorious and uninhibited about enjoying the pleasures he had been denied in England. Again according to Douglas, &quot;he was hand in glove with all the little boys on the Boulevard. He never attempted to conceal it.&quot; In a letter to Ross, Wilde laments, &quot;Today I bade good-bye, with tears and one kiss, to the beautiful Greek boy. . . he is the nicest boy you ever introduced to me.&quot; <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Just a month before his death he is quoted as saying, &quot;My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or other of us has got to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilde died of cerebral <a href="meningitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meningitis</a> on <a href="November_30" title="wikilink">November 30</a>, <a href="1900" class="uri" title="wikilink">1900</a>. Different opinions are given on the cause of the meningitis; Richard Ellmann claimed it was <a href="syphilis" title="wikilink">syphilitic</a>; <a href="Merlin_Holland" title="wikilink">Merlin Holland</a>, Wilde's grandson, thought this to be a misconception, noting that Wilde's meningitis followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a <a href="mastoidectomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">mastoidectomy</a>; Wilde's physicians, Dr. Paul Cleiss and A'Court Tucker, reported that the condition stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear (<em>une ancienne suppuration de l'oreille droite d'ailleurs en traitement depuis plusieurs ann&lt;U+00E9&gt;es</em>) and did not allude to syphilis. Most modern scholars and doctors agree that syphilis was unlikely to have been the cause of his death.</p>
<p>On his deathbed he was received into the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> church. However, biographers disagree on whether his conversion was an act of volition, since he may not have been fully conscious at the time. Eyewitnesses, however, all asserted that he was conscious.<a href="http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9404">See here</a></p>
<p>Wilde was buried in the <a href="Cimeti&lt;U+00E8&gt;re_de_Bagneux" title="wikilink">Cimeti&lt;U+00E8&gt;re de Bagneux</a> outside Paris but was later moved to <a href="P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re_Lachaise" title="wikilink">P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Lachaise Cemetery</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>. His tomb in P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Lachaise was designed by <a href="sculptor" class="uri" title="wikilink">sculptor</a> Sir <a href="Jacob_Epstein" title="wikilink">Jacob Epstein</a>, at the request of Robert Ross, who also asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes. Ross's ashes were transferred to the tomb in 1950. The numerous spots on it are lipstick traces from admirers.</p>
<p>The modernist <a href="angel" class="uri" title="wikilink">angel</a> depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male <a href="genitals" class="uri" title="wikilink">genitals</a>. They were broken off as obscene and kept as a paperweight by a succession of <a href="P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re_Lachaise" title="wikilink">P&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Lachaise Cemetery</a> keepers. Their current whereabouts are unknown. In the summer of <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, intermedia artist <a href="Leon_Johnson_(artist)" title="wikilink">Leon Johnson</a> performed a 40 minute ceremony entitled <em>Re-membering Wilde</em> in which a commissioned silver prosthesis was installed to replace the vandalised genitals <a href="http://www.leonjohnson.org/projects/wilde.html">3</a>.</p>

<li>After Wilde's death, his friend <a href="Frank_Harris" title="wikilink">Frank Harris</a> wrote a biography, <em>Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions</em>. This is generally regarded as being very unreliable, although entertaining. Of his other close friends, <a href="Robert_Sherard" title="wikilink">Robert Sherard</a>, Robert Ross, <a href="Charles_Ricketts" title="wikilink">Charles Ricketts</a> and Lord Alfred Douglas variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence.</li>
<li>An account of the argument between Frank Harris, Lord Alfred Douglas and Oscar Wilde as to the advisability of Wilde's prosecuting Queensberry can be found in the preface to George Bernard Shaw's play <em><a href="The_Dark_Lady_of_the_Sonnets" title="wikilink">The Dark Lady of the Sonnets</a></em>.</li>
<li>In 1946, Hesketh Pearson published <em>The Life of Oscar Wilde</em> (Methuen), containing materials derived from conversations with Bernard Shaw, George Alexander, Herbert Beerbohm Tree and many others who had known or worked with Wilde. This is a lively read, although inevitably somewhat dated in its approach. It gives a particularly vivid impression of what Wilde's conversation must have been like.</li>
<li>In 1954 Vyvyan Holland published his memoir <em>Son of Oscar Wilde</em>. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1999.</li>
<li>In 1975 <a href="Harford_Hyde" title="wikilink">H. Montgomery Hyde</a> published <em>Oscar Wilde: A Biography</em>.</li>
<li>In 1983 <a href="Peter_Ackroyd" title="wikilink">Peter Ackroyd</a> published <em>The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde</em>, a novel in the form of a pretended memoir.</li>

<li>1999 saw the publication of <em>Oscar Wilde on Stage and Screen</em> written by <a href="Robert_Tanitch" title="wikilink">Robert Tanitch</a>. This book is a comprehensive record of Wilde's life and work as presented on stage and screen from 1880 until 1999. It includes cast lists and snippets of reviews.</li>

<li>2005 saw the publication of <em>The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde</em>, by literary biographer <a href="Joseph_Pearce" title="wikilink">Joseph Pearce</a>.

<li>Two films of his life were released in 1960. The first to be released was <em><a href="Oscar_Wilde_(film)" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a></em> starring <a href="Robert_Morley" title="wikilink">Robert Morley</a>. Then came <em><a href="The_Trials_of_Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">The Trials of Oscar Wilde</a></em> starring <a href="Peter_Finch" title="wikilink">Peter Finch</a>. At the time homosexuality was still a criminal offence in the UK and both films were rather cagey in touching on the subject without being explicit.</li>
<li>In 1960, Irish actor <a href="Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_MacLiamm&lt;U+00F3&gt;ir" title="wikilink">Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l MacLiamm&lt;U+00F3&gt;ir</a> began performing a one-man show called <em><a href="The_Importance_of_Being_Oscar" title="wikilink">The Importance of Being Oscar</a>.</em> The show was heavily influenced by <a href="Bertolt_Brecht" title="wikilink">Brechtian</a> theory and contained many poems and samples of Wilde's writing. The play was a success and MacLiammoir toured it with success everywhere he went. It was published in 1963.</li>

<li>In 1989 <a href="Terry_Eagleton" title="wikilink">Terry Eagleton</a> premiered his play <em><a href="St._Oscar_(play)" title="wikilink">St. Oscar</a></em>.
