<p><strong>Jack Roosevelt &quot;Jackie&quot; Robinson</strong> (January 31, 1919 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 24, 1972) was the first <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">black</a> <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) player of the modern era.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Robinson broke the <a href="baseball_color_line" title="wikilink">baseball color line</a> when he debuted with the <a href="Brooklyn_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in 1947. As the first black man to play in the major leagues since the 1880s, he was instrumental in bringing an end to <a href="racial_segregation" title="wikilink">racial segregation</a> in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the <a href="Negro_leagues" title="wikilink">Negro leagues</a> for six decades.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The example of his character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the <a href="African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955&lt;U+2013&gt;1968)" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Movement</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, he played in six <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> and contributed to the Dodgers' <a href="1955_World_Series" title="wikilink">1955 World Championship</a>. He was selected for six consecutive <a href="Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star Games</a> from 1949 to 1954,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> was the recipient of the inaugural <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">MLB Rookie of the Year Award</a> in 1947, and won the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player Award</a> in 1949 &lt;U+2013&gt; the first black player so honored.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Robinson was inducted into the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting,_1962" title="wikilink">1962</a>. In 1997, Major League Baseball <a href="Uniform_number_(Major_League_Baseball)#Retirement_of_numbers" title="wikilink">retired</a> his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams.</p>
<p>Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in Major League Baseball, and the first black vice-president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in <a href="Harlem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harlem</a>, New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the <a href="Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" title="wikilink">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> and the <a href="Congressional_Gold_Medal" title="wikilink">Congressional Gold Medal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of <a href="Sharecropping" title="wikilink">sharecroppers</a> in <a href="Cairo,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Cairo, Georgia</a>, during a <a href="Spanish_flu" title="wikilink">Spanish flu</a> and <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a> <a href="epidemic" class="uri" title="wikilink">epidemic</a>.

He was also a member of the <a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a> team.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the <a href="Pomona,_California" title="wikilink">Pomona</a> annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Hall of Famers</a> <a href="Ted_Williams" title="wikilink">Ted Williams</a> and <a href="Bob_Lemon" title="wikilink">Bob Lemon</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In late January 1937, the <em><a href="Pasadena_Star-News" title="wikilink">Pasadena Star-News</a></em> newspaper reported that Robinson &quot;for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pasadena-junior-college">Pasadena Junior College</h3>
<p>After Muir, Robinson attended <a href="Pasadena_City_College" title="wikilink">Pasadena Junior College</a> (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On the football team, he played quarterback and <a href="Safety_(American_football_position)" title="wikilink">safety</a>.

<p>An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist &lt;U+2013&gt; a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident &lt;U+2013&gt; along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police &lt;U+2013&gt; gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident.

<p>Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration of to the North, where their political clout grew, and <a href="Harry_Truman" title="wikilink">President Harry Truman</a>'s <a href="Military_history_of_African_Americans" title="wikilink">desegregation of the military</a> in 1948.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> said that he was &quot;a legend and a symbol in his own time&quot;, and that he &quot;challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.&quot;<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> According to historian <a href="Doris_Kearns_Goodwin" title="wikilink">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a>, Robinson's &quot;efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ...

<p>Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> In 1999, he was posthumously named to the <a href="Major_League_Baseball_All-Century_Team" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a>.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post&lt;U+2013&gt;&quot;long ball&quot; era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era.

<li id="fn49">Sources point to various reasons for Robinson's departure from UCLA. Family sources cite financial concerns.  In addition, Robinson himself cited his growing disillusionment about the value of a college degree for a black man of his era. <a href="#Robinson" title="wikilink">Robinson, Jackie</a>, p. 11. Other sources suggest that Robinson was uninterested in academics, and behind on class work at the time he left UCLA. <a href="#Falkner" title="wikilink">Falkner</a>, p. 45; <a href="#Eig" title="wikilink">Eig</a>, p. 13.<a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
