<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <a href="San_Diego_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">San Diego Brewing Company</a> opened in 1896 as the first commercial brewery in San Diego County. At the time it was the largest manufacturing enterprise in the county. It was located on 32nd street in San Diego. It closed in 1920 because of <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Prohibition</a>. It reopened in 1935 and continued in operation until 1942, when it was displaced by the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a>'s <a href="Naval_Base_San_Diego" title="wikilink">32nd Street Naval Station</a>. A brewpub by the same name now operates in <a href="Mission_Valley,_San_Diego" title="wikilink">Mission Valley</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Mission_Brewery_Southeast_Northeast_Facades.jpg" title="fig:The old Mission Brewery building in San Diego, California" alt="The old Mission Brewery building in San Diego, California" /> <a href="Mission_Brewery" title="wikilink">Mission Brewery</a>, located in the <a href="Midway,_San_Diego" title="wikilink">Middletown</a> neighborhood of San Diego, opened in 1913 and closed due to Prohibition. It was never reopened as a brewery, but the landmark five-story brick building was repurposed several times, for kelp extraction until the 1980s and ultimately as an office building, still in operation. The building was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_San_Diego_County,_California" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1989.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The name Mission Brewery was revived in 2007 by a brewery at 14th and L Streets in <a href="Downtown_San_Diego" title="wikilink">Downtown San Diego</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Aztec_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">Aztec Brewing Company</a>, founded in <a href="Mexicali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexicali</a> in 1921, moved to San Diego in 1933 following the repeal of Prohibition. It closed in 1953 after being purchased by <a href="National_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">National Brewing Company</a>. For the next 36 years there was no local commercially brewed beer in San Diego County. The name Aztec Brewing Company has been revived in a <a href="Vista,_California" title="wikilink">Vista</a> brewery which opened in 2011.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>During Prohibition (1920â€“1933), San Diegans could still drink beer by crossing the border into <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. In the formerly small town of <a href="Tijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tijuana</a> more than 180 cantinas were built to serve American visitors, and the city's population grew tenfold between 1920 and 1930. Several modern breweries were built in Mexicali to supply the demand.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Before Prohibition there had been seven breweries in San Diego. After repeal there were three: Aztec Brewing Company, San Diego Brewing Company, and Balboa Brewing Company. These were soon either purchased by the Big Three national brewing companies (Anheuser-Busch, Coors, and Miller) or driven out of business by the aggressive marketing practices of the Big Three.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> From 1953 until the 1980s the local beer market was dominated by the large national brewers, with the alternative being imported beer from Mexico. But changes in national and state law in the late 1970s made home brewing legal, and in 1982 California allowed breweries to operate restaurants on their premises, which made <a href="brewpub" title="wikilink">brewpubs</a> possible.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Karl_Strauss_Carlsbad.jpg" title="fig:The Karl Strauss brewpub in Carlsbad|thumb|right" alt="The Karl Strauss brewpub in Carlsbad|thumb|right" /> In 1989 the <a href="Karl_Strauss_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">Karl Strauss Brewing Company</a> opened a brewery and brewpub on Columbia Street in <a href="Downtown_San_Diego" title="wikilink">Downtown San Diego</a> and expanded into distribution brewing in 1991. This was the first commercial brewery in San Diego since 1953, and for many San Diego consumers it was their first exposure to freshly brewed beer and to styles such as <a href="amber_lager" title="wikilink">amber lager</a> and <a href="pale_ale" title="wikilink">pale ale</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the mid-1990s a second, more adventurous wave of craft breweries appeared, led by <a href="Pizza_Port" title="wikilink">Pizza Port</a>, Stone and Alesmith.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The local craft beer movement was inspired in part by <a href="homebrewing" class="uri" title="wikilink">homebrewing</a> hobbyists, supported by the storefront Home Brew Mart, which opened in 1992 and later spun off the <a href="Ballast_Point_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">Ballast Point Brewing Company</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Beer festivals like the Real Ale Festival, launched in 1997 by Tomme Arthur and Tom Nickel, promoted the new styles and educated a new generation of beer drinkers.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By 2004 San Diego was so well established in the brewing world that the biennial <a href="World_Beer_Cup" title="wikilink">World Beer Cup</a> competition was held there; 11 medals went to locals.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> San Diego hosted the event again in 2008, taking 14 medals, and in 2012, taking 16 medals.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The &quot;Best Small Brewer&quot; Award has gone to San Diego County brewers three times: 2004 (Nickel for Oggi's Pizza), 2008 (Arthur for <a href="Lost_Abbey" title="wikilink">Lost Abbey</a>/<a href="Port_Brewing_Company" title="wikilink">Port Brewing Company</a>), and 2010 (Ballast Point brewers).</p>
<h2 id="economic-impact">Economic impact</h2>
<p>Brewing has been one of the fastest-growing business sectors in San Diego, with seven new licenses issued in 2010, fifteen in 2011 and eighteen in 2012.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 2011 the county's brewers and brew pubs generated $300 million in direct economic impact to the county, making $600 million in sales and generating or sustaining 2,800 jobs.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In addition, beer-related tourism is an important part of San Diego County's visitor industry throughout the year;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the county is described as a &quot;beer city destination&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Many breweries offer tours of their facilities and tasting rooms, and dozens of commercial tour operators market &quot;beer tours&quot; in San Diego County.</p>
<h2 id="annual-events">Annual events</h2>
<p>San Diego Beer Week, launched in 2009, is now a ten-day county-wide festival, held in early November and aimed at both local residents and tourists. It showcases the local beer scene and fosters knowledge about the area's brewing heritage.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The festival kicks off with the San Diego Brewers Guild Festival<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and continues with hundreds of large and small events hosted by breweries, nano-breweries, pubs, and alehouses. In 2012 there were more than 500 events scheduled during Beer Week.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The San Diego International Beer Festival takes place during the <a href="San_Diego_County_Fair" title="wikilink">San Diego County Fair</a> every June. It includes seminars and classes, <a href="beer_tasting" title="wikilink">beer tasting</a>, and beer judging. Participating breweries in 2013 came from 22 states and 16 countries.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Other special beer events throughout the year include the San Diego Beer Festival in July,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the San Diego Festival of Beer in September,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the Strong Ale Festival in December.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
