<p><strong>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig</strong> (d. 16 February in either 1077 or 1078) was an <a href="Abbot_of_Evesham" title="wikilink">Abbot of Evesham</a> in and around the time of the <a href="Norman_Conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest of England</a>. Born sometime around 1010 or 1015, he was elected abbot in 1058. Known for his legal expertise, he administered estates for <a href="Ealdred_(archbishop)" title="wikilink">Ealdred</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Worcester</a> prior to his election as abbot. After his election, he appears to have acted as Ealdred's deputy, and was considered as a possible sucessor when Ealdred was elected <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig worked during his abbacy to recover estates that had been lost to Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates.</p>
<p>After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was one of the few Englishmen trusted by the new King <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a>, and was given authority over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the <a href="Harrying_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Harrying of the North</a> in 1069-1070, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the <a href="Revolt_of_the_Earls" title="wikilink">rebellion of 1075</a>, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialized in a work on his life that was later incorporated in the <em><a href="Chronicon_Abbatiae_de_Evesham" title="wikilink">Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham</a></em>, a 13th century history of the abbey and its abbots.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-election-as-abbot">Early life and election as abbot</h2>
<p>He was probably born about 1010 to 1015,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and inherited a large amount of land from his family.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He served as an administrator of the estates of Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, as well as those of <a href="Evesham_Abbey" title="wikilink">Evesham Abbey</a>. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was also known as a legal expert.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was elected abbot in 1058, and was blessed on 23 April 1058,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> by Ealdred, who was the diocesan bishop for Evesham. He replaced the previous abbot, Mannig, who had become paralyzed. One story has it that Ealdred asked King <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a> to give the abbacy to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> another, in the <em>Chronicon de Abbatiae Evesham</em>, a history of Evesham Abbey, states that it was Mannig who asked the king to make the appointment. The <em>Chronicon</em> also states that the blessing took place at Gloucester, and that Ealdred was Archbishop at the time, although Ealdred did not become Archbishop of York until 1060.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>During his abbacy, he appears to have acted as the deputy for Ealdred, as bishop of Worcester.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1062, he was one of the candidates to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>, but <a href="Wulfstan_(Bishop_of_Worcester)" title="wikilink">Wulfstan</a> was chosen instead.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and <a href="Regenbald" class="uri" title="wikilink">Regenbald</a>, the chancellor.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The abbot also led military forces in battle,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and served King Edward as an advisor.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's relationship with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was acting as the abbot's diocesan bishop, appears to have been tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's abbacy, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was not there.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Although in legal matters Wulfstan and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig were in conflict, personally, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 in order to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>During Edward's reign, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig worked to recover some of the abbey's estates that had been granted to others in the past but had not been returned to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession of a number of these lost estates.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the <em>Chronicon</em> is concerned with a listing of estates that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of <a href="Worcestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>, <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>, and <a href="Gloucestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="after-the-conquest">After the Conquest</h2>
<p>After the Norman Conquest, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was trusted by the new king, William the Conqueror, and given some administrative duties.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was one of a very small number of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Probably in 1069, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was given authority in the former lands of the <a href="Mercia" title="wikilink">Mercian kingdom</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> After the deposition of <a href="Godric_of_Winchcombe" title="wikilink">Godric</a>, the abbot of <a href="Winchcombe_Abbey" title="wikilink">Winchcombe Abbey</a> in 1070, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig served as his jailor.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 1072, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was acting as a royal judge in the western part of England.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During the rebellion of 1075, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig kept <a href="Roger_de_Breteuil" title="wikilink">Roger de Breteuil</a>, the <a href="Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Earl of Hereford</a>, one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was assisted by Wulfstan,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, <a href="Urse_d&#39;Abetot" title="wikilink">Urse d'Abetot</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by redeeming loans.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as <a href="Lanfranc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lanfranc</a>, the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and Serlo, the <a href="Abbot_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Abbot of Gloucester</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A number of English landowners commended themselves into &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's death.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Although &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was known for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died fighting for King <a href="Harold_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Harold Godwinson</a>, probably at the <a href="Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> While abbot, even after the Conquest, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the <a href="Anglo-Saxon_art" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon style</a>, not the Norman <a href="Romanesque_architecture" title="wikilink">Romanesque</a> which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Besides his administrative and legal duties, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was known for his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the <a href="Harrying_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Harrying of the North</a> by King William in 1069-1070, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The <em>Chronicon</em> states that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig also administered Winchcombe Abbey for a number of years,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> at first from 1066 to 1069 when a Norman monk was appointed abbot, and then again from 1075 until &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's death.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Hemming_(monk)" title="wikilink">Hemming</a>, a medieval monastic writer from <a href="Worcester_Priory" title="wikilink">Worcester Priory</a>, wrote of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig that he &quot;surpassed everyone by his intelligence, his shrewdness and his knowledge of worldly law&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The <em>Chronicon</em> reports that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig suffered from <a href="gout" class="uri" title="wikilink">gout</a>, and states that it was the cause of his death.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig died in either 1077 or 1078.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <em>Chronicon</em> gives his death date as 16 February 1077,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> but it is unclear if the <em>Chronicon</em> began its years on 1 January or in March, so the date could be 1077 or 1078.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="writing-about-u00c6thelwig">Writing about &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig</h2>
<p>A near-contemporary account of his life is included in the <em>Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham</em>, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This was a 13th century work by <a href="Thomas_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Thomas of Marlborough</a>, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the <em>Chronicon</em>, he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his <em>Chronicon</em>. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The historian R. R. Darlington argued that it was written right after &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's death, but another historian, <a href="David_Knowles" title="wikilink">David Knowles</a>, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, <a href="Dominic_of_Evesham" title="wikilink">Dominic</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <a href="Antonia_Gransden" title="wikilink">Antonia Gransden</a>, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it more likely to have been written shortly after &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's death.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The work itself is not a <a href="hagiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">hagiography</a>, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
