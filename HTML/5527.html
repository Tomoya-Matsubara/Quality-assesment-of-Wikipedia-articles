<p><strong>Zubir Said</strong> (also <strong>Zubir <a href="Sayyid" title="wikilink">Syed</a></strong>) (<a href="22_July" title="wikilink">22 July</a> <a href="1907" class="uri" title="wikilink">1907</a> – <a href="16_November" title="wikilink">16 November</a> <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a>) was a <a href="Singapore" title="wikilink">Singaporean</a> <a href="composer" class="uri" title="wikilink">composer</a> originally from the <a href="Minangkabau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minangkabau</a> highlands of <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> who composed the <a href="national_anthem" title="wikilink">national anthem</a> of <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, &quot;<em><a href="Majulah_Singapura" title="wikilink">Majulah Singapura</a></em>&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;). A self-taught musician, Zubir also worked as a score arranger and songwriter for <a href="Cathay_Organisation#Studios_Productions" title="wikilink">Cathay-Keris Film Productions</a> for 12 years, composing numerous songs for the company's Malay films. He is believed to have written about 1,500 songs, less than 10% of which were recorded.</p>
<p>It has been said that Zubir was viewed by many as a composer with a &quot;true Malay soul&quot;, as his songs &lt;U+2013&gt; traditional, yet modern and patriotic &lt;U+2013&gt; were interwoven with historical messages and Malay truisms, and that he and his Minangkabau contemporaries awoke a wave of national consciousness in the 1950s.</p>

<p>The eldest child in a family of three boys and five girls, Zubir Said was born on <a href="22_July" title="wikilink">22 July</a> <a href="1907" class="uri" title="wikilink">1907</a> in <a href="Bukittinggi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bukittinggi</a> in the <a href="Minangkabau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minangkabau</a> highlands of <a href="West_Sumatra" title="wikilink">West Sumatra</a>, <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the <a href="Solfedge" title="wikilink">Solfa</a> music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a <a href="flute" class="uri" title="wikilink">flute</a>, and in <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">middle school</a>, he learned to play the <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a> and <a href="drums" class="uri" title="wikilink">drums</a> from fellow students and the <em><a href="keroncong" class="uri" title="wikilink">keroncong</a></em> group he was involved in.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1928 at the age of 21, Zubir went to <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a> to make a living as a musician, taking up the suggestion of a sailor friend who had described the island as a place of &quot;glittering lights, <em>kopi susu</em> [coffee with milk] and butter&quot;. This was done in the face of objections from his village chieftan father, Mohamad Said bin Sanang, who believed music to be against religion. Zubir's first job was as a musician with City Opera, a <em><a href="bangsawan" class="uri" title="wikilink">bangsawan</a></em> or Malay opera troupe. He became the troupe's bandleader. Thereafter, in 1936, he joined the recording company <a href="HMV" title="wikilink">His Master's Voice</a>. Zubir went to <a href="Java" class="uri" title="wikilink">Java</a> to marry Tarminah Kario Wikromo, a <em>keroncong</em> singer, in 1938; they returned to Zubir's home town of Bukittinggi in 1941 just before the outbreak of World War II. Coming back to Singapore in 1947, Zubir worked as a part-time photographer with the <em><a href="Utusan_Malaysia" title="wikilink">Utusan Melayu</a></em> newspaper<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> while composing and performing music and songs. In 1949 he took up the post of orchestra conductor at <a href="Shaw_Organisation" title="wikilink">Shaw Brothers</a>' Malay Film Production, and in 1952 he joined <a href="Cathay_Organisation#Studios_Productions" title="wikilink">Cathay-Keris Film Productions</a> as a score arranger and songwriter for the company's Malay films, including <em>Sumpah Pontianak</em> (<em>Blood of Pontianak</em>, 1958) and <em>Chuchu Datuk Merah</em> (<em>Grandchildren of Datuk Merah</em>, 1963).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1957, he received his first public recognition when his songs were performed at the <a href="Victoria_Theatre_and_Concert_Hall" title="wikilink">Victoria Theatre</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="majulah-singapura">&quot;<em>Majulah Singapura</em>&quot;</h3>
<p>Singapore, then a <a href="British_overseas_territories#History" title="wikilink">British colony</a>, had been conferred city status by a <a href="royal_charter" title="wikilink">royal charter</a> from <a href="George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George VI</a> in 1951. In the late 1950s, the <a href="City_Council_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">City Council of Singapore</a> approached Zubir to compose a song for the city to be titled &quot;<em>Majulah Singapura</em>&quot;, which was a motto displayed in the Victoria Theatre after it was renovated in 1958. Zubir's song, &quot;<em><a href="Majulah_Singapura" title="wikilink">Majulah Singapura</a></em>&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;, 1956&lt;U+2013&gt;1957), was first performed by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre on <a href="6_September" title="wikilink">6 September</a> <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a> to celebrate its official reopening. When <a href="Self-governance_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Singapore attained self-government</a> in 1959, the Government felt that a <a href="national_anthem" title="wikilink">national anthem</a> was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. It decided that the City Council's song, which was already popular, would serve this purpose. After some revisions were made to the song, it was adopted by the <a href="Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Legislative Assembly</a> on <a href="11_November" title="wikilink">11 November</a> <a href="1959" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959</a>, and on <a href="30_November" title="wikilink">30 November</a> the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> was passed. This statute regulated the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. &quot;<em>Majulah Singapura</em>&quot; was presented to the nation on <a href="3_December" title="wikilink">3 December</a> at the launch of &quot;Loyalty Week&quot;, replacing the colonial anthem &quot;<a href="God_Save_the_Queen" title="wikilink">God Save the Queen</a>&quot;. After Singapore's <a href="History_of_the_Republic_of_Singapore#Independence_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">full independence from Malaysia</a> on <a href="9_August" title="wikilink">9 August</a> <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a>, &quot;<em>Majulah Singapura</em>&quot; was formally adopted as the Republic's national anthem. In a 1984 oral history interview, to sum up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb &quot;<em>Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung</em>&quot; (&quot;You should hold up the sky of the land where you live&quot;).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Zubir continued working for Cathay-Keris Film Productions until he retired in 1964, composing numerous songs for Malay films. In 1962, his songs for the movie <em>Dang Anom</em> won an award at the Ninth Asian Film Festival in Seoul, South Korea.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He also gave music lessons.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Zubir died at the age of 80 on <a href="16_November" title="wikilink">16 November</a> <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> at <a href="Joo_Chiat" title="wikilink">Joo Chiat</a> Place in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, leaving behind four daughters and a son.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="awards">Awards</h3>
<p>In recognition of his contributions to the State, Zubir was conferred the <em><a href="Sijil_Kemuliaan" title="wikilink">Sijil Kemuliaan</a></em> (Certificate of Honour) on <a href="16_March" title="wikilink">16 March</a> <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the <em><a href="Bintang_Bakti_Masyarakat" title="wikilink">Bintang Bakti Masyarakat</a></em> (Public Service Star) in the same year.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1971, he received the <em>Jasawan Seni</em> (cultural medallion) award from eight Malay cultural organizations, and the <a href="Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations" title="wikilink">Asean</a> Cultural and Communications Award in 1987. He also received a Certificate of Commendation from the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) for composing the AUPE song. In 1995, Zubir was posthumously<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (COMPASS).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Zubir is primarily remembered for composing Singapore's national anthem, &quot;<em>Majulah Singapura</em>&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;). The <a href="Malay_language" title="wikilink">Malay</a> lyrics exhort Singaporeans to &quot;progress towards happiness together&quot; (&quot;<em>Sama-sama menuju bahagia</em>&quot;) so that their &quot;noble aspiration[s] bring Singapore success&quot; (&quot;<em>Cita-cita kita yang mulia / Berjaya Singapura</em>&quot;), and to &quot;unite in a new spirit&quot; (&quot;<em>Marilah kita bersatu / Dengan semangat yang baru</em>&quot;).</p>
<p>In 1956, he also submitted compositions to the <a href="Federation_of_Malaya" title="wikilink">Malayan</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; later <a href="Malaysia" title="wikilink">Malaysian</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; Government for consideration for their national anthem. However, a different song, <em><a href="Negaraku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Negaraku</a></em>, was selected in the end.</p>
<p>Zubir is also remembered for his composition &quot;<em><a href="Semoga_Bahagia" title="wikilink">Semoga Bahagia</a></em>&quot; (&quot;May You Achieve Happiness&quot;) which was aimed at primary-school students, advising them to work hard for their future. It has become a <a href="Children&#39;s_Day#Singapore" title="wikilink">Children's Day</a> song for Singaporean children, and is thus often sung in schools on <a href="1_October" title="wikilink">1 October</a>. It is also performed during the <a href="Singapore_Youth_Festival" title="wikilink">Singapore Youth Festival</a>.</p>
<p>Zubir is estimated to have written about 1,500 songs, including those written for Cathay-Keris Film Productions' Malay films in the 1950s and 1960s. Less than 10% of these songs were recorded. On <a href="22_August" title="wikilink">22 August</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Zubir's family signed an agreement with <a href="Universal_Music_Group" title="wikilink">Universal Music</a> in Malaysia for the latter to manage his works. The <a href="copyright" class="uri" title="wikilink">copyright</a> in the songs remains with his family. The idea to do so came after his third daughter, <a href="Malay_titles#Tan_Sri" title="wikilink">Puan Sri</a> Dr. Rohana Zubir, a retired lecturer with the <a href="University_of_Malaya" title="wikilink">University of Malaya</a>, met Sandy Monteiro, senior vice-president (Asean) of the Universal Music Publishing Group in 2005 through Monteiro's wife, who was a good friend of hers. Dr. Rohana was reported as saying: &quot;It is time to hand over the songs in order to revive them two decades after my father's passing. I hope to ensure that his songs continue to live in the hearts of young artists in Malaysia.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>It is said that Zubir was viewed by many as a composer with a &quot;true Malay soul&quot;, as his songs, traditional but yet modern and patriotic, were interwoven with historical messages and Malay truisms. Journalist A. Samad Ismail commented that Zubir and his Minangkabau contemporaries awoke a wave of national consciousness in the 1950s.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
