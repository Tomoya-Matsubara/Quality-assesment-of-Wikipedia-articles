<p><strong>Hurricane Doreen</strong> was considered the worst <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> to affect <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> in 32 years. The tenth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the very inactive <a href="1977_Pacific_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1977 Pacific hurricane season</a>, Doreen developed from a tropical disturbance offshore of Mexico. After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Doreen later that day. Further strengthening occurred in the following days, and Doreen had reached hurricane status early on August 15. Doreen then re-curved to the north-northwest and began approaching <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a>. As Doreen again re-curved to the northwest on August 15, it made two landfalls on the west coast of Baja California, the first time as a hurricane on August 15, and the second one as a tropical storm on August 16. Re-merging into the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>, Doreen paralleled the Baja California Peninsula and eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August 17. Early on the following day, the storm dissipated near the southwest coast of California.</p>
<p>Hurricane Doreen and its remnants caused severe flooding in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. In Mexico, heavy rainfall was reported on both Baja California and the mainland of Mexico. Flooding left 2,000 people homeless in <a href="Mexicali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexicali</a> along the United States-Mexico border, in addition, 325 homes and businesses were destroyed in southern California. Several highways were also flooded during the passage of the storm, most notably, lanes on <a href="Interstate_8" title="wikilink">Interstate 8</a> and <a href="Interstate_15" title="wikilink">Interstate 15</a> were washed out. In <a href="San_Diego_County,_California" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> and <a href="Imperial_County,_California" title="wikilink">Imperial County</a>, the total damage to agricultural interests was $25 million (1977 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>). In addition, eight fatalities were reported in California. Elsewhere, impact from Doreen or its remnants was relatively light.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The origins of Hurricane Doreen were from a tropical disturbance which formed  west of <a href="Acapulco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Acapulco</a>, Mexico, on August 11. Over the next two days, the system drifted westward at . By 0000 UTC August 13, the <a href="Eastern_Pacific_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center</a> began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Ten, which was centered  west of Acapulco, Mexico. Immediately after developing, the depression curved northwestward, and began slowly intensifying over <a href="sea_surface_temperatures" title="wikilink">sea surface temperatures</a> (SST's) of . By 1800 UTC, winds increased to 50 mph (85 km/h), and the depression was then upgraded to Tropical Storm Doreen, which was centered about  west-northwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Air Force reconnaissance began investigating Doreen late on August 14, and located the center about  south of the tip of Baja California. Another flight into the storm shortly thereafter confirmed that Doreen had intensified into a hurricane at 1800 UTC.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time, the eye of Doreen was around  in diameter. After becoming a hurricane, Doreen re-curved to the north-northwest as it sped up slightly to . Doreen approached Baja California, as it maintained minimal hurricane status. By August 18 at 1800 UTC, Doreen was centered only  when it curved northwestward. Late on August 18, the storm made landfall on the western coast of Baja California as a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Doreen re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, over SST's of less than . As a result, Doreen weakened to a tropical storm before making another landfall on the Port Eugenia Peninsula on August 16 shortly after 0600 UTC. Once again, Doreen quickly re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean over the Bay of Sebastian Vizcaino. Due to SST's as low as , Doreen continued to weaken, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by early on August 17. After satellite imagery noted a poorly-defined low-level circulation, the final advisory was issued on Doreen , which was centered about  west of <a href="San_Clemente_Island" title="wikilink">San Clemente Island</a>, California at 0000 UTC on August 18. The remnants of the storm tracked into the <a href="Southwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Southwestern United States</a> and dissipated over the <a href="Colorado_River" title="wikilink">Colorado River</a> Valley.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
