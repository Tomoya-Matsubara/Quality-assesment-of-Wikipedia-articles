Sarkozy has stated that pension reform is the first in a series of measures designed to roll back protections for <a href="trade_unions" title="wikilink">trade unions</a> in France, and both unions and Sarkozy see the pension strikes as a key political test.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cause-of-the-strikes">Cause of the strikes</h2>
<p>France's national labour law permits workers in certain hazardous or difficult professions to retire with full pension benefits after 37.5 years rather than 40 years. The Sarkozy administration claims the current pension system allows some public sector workers to retire as early as age 50.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The government calculated the cost of these early-retirement benefits at $7 billion a year.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>President <a href="Nicolas_Sarkozy" title="wikilink">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> feels that his victory in the <a href="French_presidential_election,_2007" title="wikilink">2007 presidential election </a> gave him a mandate to carry out labour reforms, stating &quot;I said before I was elected what I would do,&quot; and &quot;We will do these reforms because they have to be done.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He declared the strikes a test of political will. &quot;I will pursue these reforms to the end,&quot; he said in a speech to the <a href="European_Parliament" title="wikilink">European Parliament</a>. &quot;Nothing will blow me off course.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

However in a short interview granted to the BBC the director claimed these cancellations were due to insufficient customers, because of travel difficulties incurred by the strikes. Some university students demonstrated and blocked the entrances to their campuses in opposition to plans to allow private funding of Universities.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the University of Nanterre students were forcefully removed by riot police, however this was censored on the national news.

<p><a href="Minister_of_Social_Affairs_(France)" title="wikilink">Minister of Employment, Social Cohesion and Housing</a> <a href="Xavier_Bertrand" title="wikilink">Xavier Bertrand</a>, whose portfolio includes labor relations, held several negotiating sessions with the unions throughout the day on November 13 and 14.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Bertrand told the unions that pension reform was non-negotiable, but proposed a month-long period of negotiations between the unions and each state-controlled agency to discuss ways to minimize the effects on existing workers.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Some improvements in mass transit also occurred on <a href="November_14" title="wikilink">November 14</a>. The main M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro commuter lines remained shut, while other lines ran between 20 and 50 percent at normal capacity. However, only a third of Paris buses were running. The <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> reported that 150 of the 700 high-speed <a href="TGV" class="uri" title="wikilink">TGV</a> trains were running, an increase of 60 over the day before.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="November_18" title="wikilink">November 18</a>, a demonstration was held by pro-reform and anti-strikes organizations in Paris. They gathered between 8,000 and 20,000 protesters against public transportation strikers, described as &quot;hostage takers&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="Perc_strike_nov07_fr.png" title="fig:Percentage of RATP and SNCF employees reported as being on strike by their employers" alt="Percentage of RATP and SNCF employees reported as being on strike by their employers" width="300" /> <a href="November_20" title="wikilink">November 20</a> marked the 7th day of striking and strikers were joined by other civil servants including teachers, <a href="La_Poste_(France)" title="wikilink">postal workers</a> and newspaper printers. The printers were also protesting against reorganisations within the printing industry. <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Air traffic control employees were also on strike, causing delays of 45 minutes on flights from the Parisian airports according to <a href="A&lt;U+00E9&gt;roports_de_Paris" title="wikilink">ADP</a>. However it was not indicated if these delays are to be added to the usual delays.</p>
<p>During the night from <a href="November_20" title="wikilink">November 20</a> to <a href="November_21" title="wikilink">November 21</a>, the <a href="TGV" class="uri" title="wikilink">TGV</a> network was sabotaged by fires, further adding to the delays caused by the 8th day of striking on the 21st. Approximately 30 kilometres of track were damaged, both the unions and the President have condemned these acts. &lt;ref name&quot;BBC sabotage&quot;&gt; </ref></p>
<p>On <a href="November_21" title="wikilink">November 21</a>, the CGT called for the strikes to stop as the government has allegedly agreed to negotiate. An opinion poll published in the Figaro estimates 2/3rds of the French are against the strike, and the Ministry of Economy has declared the strike is costing the French economy &lt;U+20AC&gt;400 million a day and SNCF &lt;U+20AC&gt;100 million a day. According to the <a href="SNCF" class="uri" title="wikilink">SNCF</a>, the operator of the national train lines 23% of their staff are still on strike, while the <a href="RATP" class="uri" title="wikilink">RATP</a> operating the Paris M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro, and some suburban trains claims 16% of their staff are on strike. However the service on the Parisian trains and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro is still below 25%, due to the fact that most of the strikers are train drivers. <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="November_21" title="wikilink">November 21</a> the number of strikers continued to diminish, and talks were engaged in-between the government and the unions.</p>
<p>Strikes continued on <a href="November_22" title="wikilink">November 22</a> with the numbers of strikers still diminishing, public transport was still heavily affected however. Following a day of ongoing talks with the government, 42 of the 45 union committees voted to stop the strike, and the <a href="RATP" class="uri" title="wikilink">RATP</a> and <a href="SNCF" class="uri" title="wikilink">SNCF</a> are announcing almost normal service for <a href="November_23" title="wikilink">November 23</a>, with in-between 70 and 100% of public transport services running. It is said talks could last for a month. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
