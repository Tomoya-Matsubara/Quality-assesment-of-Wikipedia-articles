<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>While deleting files, BMO accidentally deletes its core system drivers. Finn and Jake decide to accompany BMO to the Mo Factory so that BMO can get the drivers re-installed; BMO cautions Finn and Jake that its memory will be erased, so the duo disguise themselves as robots and successfully sneak past DMO (voiced by <a href="Aziz_Ansari" title="wikilink">Aziz Ansari</a>) and infiltrate the facility. Once inside, they find the factory derelict and abandoned. DMO and the security SMOs (voiced by <a href="Paul_F._Tompkins" title="wikilink">Paul F. Tompkins</a>) soon catch onto Finn, Jake, and BMO's scheme and give chase. The three evade security and sneak into the SMO lounge.</p>
<p>BMO <a href="hack_(computer_security)" title="wikilink">hacks</a> into one of the SMOs and learns the location of the core system driver installation deck. Once again, the SMOs give chase until Finn, Jake, and BMO reach the heart of the facility. There, the three meet Moseph &quot;Moe&quot; Giovanni (voiced by <a href="Chuck_McCann" title="wikilink">Chuck McCann</a>), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs. Moe explains BMO's backstory, revealing that BMO was created to take care of and have fun with Moe's son; however, Moe never had children and so he released BMO into the wild to find another family. Moe updates BMO drivers, and introduces it to his &quot;family&quot; of MOs.</p>

<p>Oliver Sava of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> awarded the episode a &quot;B+&quot;. He applauded it for its exploration of BMO, its opening of new narrative opportunities with the introduction of Moe. Furthermore, he complimented both Ansari's and Tompkin's voice acting, noting that the &quot;actors hired by this show have speaking voices that are immediately distinct, and that natural personality helps flesh out bit roles and make them memorable.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Furthermore, Sava wrote that the entry's climax, featuring Moe explaining that BMO was built to understand fun was &quot;an interesting insight into the philosophy behind this series&quot; because the &quot;childlike mentality of fun and play is an enlightened state in <em>Adventure Time</em>, and BMO reaches that every day with Finn and Jake.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
