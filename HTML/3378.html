<p><strong>Princess Leia Organa Solo of <a href="Alderaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alderaan</a></strong> (born <strong>Leia Amidala Skywalker on <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(O-Q)#Polis_Massa" title="wikilink">Polis Massa</a></strong> in <a href="Dates_in_Star_Wars" title="wikilink">19 BBY</a>) is a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> in the <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> <a href="Star_Wars_galaxy" title="wikilink">galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Leia Amidala Skywalker is the daughter of <a href="Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Amidala" title="wikilink">Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; Amidala</a> of Naboo and fallen <a href="Jedi_Knight" title="wikilink">Jedi Knight</a> <a href="Anakin_Skywalker" title="wikilink">Anakin Skywalker</a>. Leia was raised on <a href="Alderaan_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Alderaan</a> by Senator, Prince <a href="Bail_Organa" title="wikilink">Bail Organa</a> and his wife, Queen <a href="Breha_Organa" title="wikilink">Breha Organa</a>. Growing up surrounded by politics, she went on to hold a seat in the <a href="Imperial_Senate" title="wikilink">Imperial Senate</a>, where she secretly played a large role in the <a href="Rebel_Alliance" title="wikilink">Rebel Alliance</a>. Leia is also the only Skywalker twin to have any memory of their mother. Leia claimed to remember her &quot;real&quot; mother through &quot;just images really... feelings.&quot; <a href="George_Lucas" title="wikilink">George Lucas</a> stated that he wanted one of the Skywalker twins to recall their mother. He claimed since Luke knew Vader was their father, he most likely felt that Leia was entitled to the brief memory of her real mother from infancy.</p>
<p>She was portrayed by actress <a href="Carrie_Fisher" title="wikilink">Carrie Fisher</a> in <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="wikilink">A New Hope</a></em>, <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="wikilink">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, and <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" title="wikilink">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, as well as <em><a href="The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special" title="wikilink">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em>. <a href="Aiden_Barton" title="wikilink">Aiden Barton</a> appeared as an infant Leia in <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith" title="wikilink">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>. <a href="Ann_Sachs" title="wikilink">Ann Sachs</a> provided the voice of Leia in the <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a> <a href="Star_Wars_(radio)" title="wikilink">radio dramas</a> of the <a href="Original_trilogy_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">original trilogy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Leia's family consisted of many influential individuals, primarily government officials and politicians. She is raised as the adopted daughter of Queen (and later Minister of Education) <a href="Breha_Organa" title="wikilink">Breha Organa</a> and her husband, Viceroy/Prince Consort <a href="Bail_Organa" title="wikilink">Bail Organa</a> of Alderaan. A politician-turned-rebel and <a href="spy" class="uri" title="wikilink">spy</a>, she has a forceful personality and keen intellect, having accomplished much in her youth. Leia was a member of the <a href="Imperial_Senate" title="wikilink">Imperial Senate</a> until <a href="Palpatine" title="wikilink">Emperor Palpatine</a> dissolved it. She then became a leader of the <a href="Rebel_Alliance" title="wikilink">Rebel Alliance</a> and, many years later, Chief of State of the <a href="New_Republic_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">New Republic</a>. While raised in privileged surroundings, this fiery diplomat received martial training in order to defend herself, learning <a href="hand_to_hand_combat" title="wikilink">hand to hand combat</a> and how to use a <a href="blaster_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">blaster</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Chronologically, Leia first appears in <em><a href="Revenge_of_the_Sith" title="wikilink">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, when her real mother, Senator <a href="Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Amidala" title="wikilink">Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; Amidala</a> of <a href="Naboo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naboo</a>, gives birth to her and her twin brother, <a href="Luke_Skywalker" title="wikilink">Luke</a>, at <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(O-Q)#Polis_Massa" title="wikilink">Polis Massa</a>. Before Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; dies while being comforted by <a href="Obi-Wan_Kenobi" title="wikilink">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, Leia looks at her and gains a faint memory of her mother, due to her connection to <a href="Force_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">the Force</a>. </p>
<p>After Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s death, Obi-Wan and <a href="Yoda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yoda</a> decide that they must hide the Skywalker children from their father, who had recently fallen to the <a href="dark_side" title="wikilink">dark side</a> and become the <a href="Sith" title="wikilink">Sith Lord</a> <a href="Darth_Vader" title="wikilink">Darth Vader</a>. Leia is sent to Alderaan with <a href="R2-D2" class="uri" title="wikilink">R2-D2</a> and <a href="C-3PO" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-3PO</a> with her adoptive father so she would not be found by the <a href="Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Empire</a>. According to the <em>Episode III Visual Dictionary</em>, Leia's full name at birth is Leia Amidala Skywalker.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="Expanded_Universe_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Expanded Universe</a>, Leia is raised with <a href="Winter_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Winter</a>, who becomes her handmaiden later on in life, as well as her children's nanny.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, Leia becomes the youngest member of the <a href="Imperial_Senate" title="wikilink">Imperial Senate</a> and becomes good friends with Senator <a href="Pooja_Naberrie" title="wikilink">Pooja Naberrie</a> of Naboo, her biological maternal cousin. She also becomes one of the driving forces behind the <a href="Rebel_Alliance_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Rebel Alliance</a>, the <a href="New_Republic_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">New Republic</a> and even later, the <a href="Galactic_Alliance" title="wikilink">Galactic Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>In <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="wikilink">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></em>, Senator Organa is captured by Darth Vader. He accuses her of being a <a href="treason" title="wikilink">traitor</a> and demands to know the location of the secret technical plans of the <a href="Death_Star" title="wikilink">Death Star</a>, the Empire's newest and most powerful weapon. Unknown to him, the young senator has hidden the plans inside an <a href="Astromech_droid" title="wikilink">Astromech droid</a>, R2-D2, and has sent it to find the legendary Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the nearby planet of <a href="Tatooine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatooine</a>. Later, Vader has her <a href="torture" title="wikilink">tortured</a>, but she resists telling him anything. Still believing she could be useful, <a href="Grand_Moff_Tarkin" title="wikilink">Grand Moff Tarkin</a>, Commander of the Death Star, threatens to destroy her homeworld with the superweapon unless she reveals the location of the hidden Rebel base. She still does not give in and lies to them, as Tarkin ordered Alderaan to be destroyed anyway, killing the entire population (except those who had been off-world) and her entire family. Expecting to be terminated, she does not give up hope and is finally rescued by unlikely heroes: Luke Skywalker, an elderly Obi-Wan Kenobi, the cocky smuggler <a href="Han_Solo" title="wikilink">Han Solo</a>, the <a href="Wookiee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wookiee</a> <a href="Chewbacca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chewbacca</a>, and the two droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO. When they finally escape, at the expense of Obi-Wan's life, they take part in the <a href="Battle_of_Yavin" title="wikilink">Battle of Yavin</a>. Luke, in his one-man <a href="X-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">X-wing</a> fighter, blows up the Empire's most dreaded weapon. In the <a href="Massassi_Temple" title="wikilink">Massassi Temple</a> at the hidden Rebel base on <a href="Yavin_4" title="wikilink">Yavin 4</a>, the radiant Princess Leia Organa presents the Alderaanian Medal of Freedom to her rescuers and the heroes of the battle.</p>
<h3 id="the-empire-strikes-back"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></h3>
<p>Three years later, in <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="wikilink">Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, Princess Leia helps with the evacuation of the Rebel base on <a href="Hoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoth</a>. Despite the ongoing battle, she remains vigilant and issues commands from the crumbling base. Luckily, she is able to escape any danger and flees with C-3PO, Han, and Chewbacca on the <em><a href="Millennium_Falcon" title="wikilink">Millennium Falcon</a></em>. Although they are pursued by Imperial fighters, they manage to dodge their fire by flying into an <a href="asteroid" class="uri" title="wikilink">asteroid</a> field when the hyperdrive broke down. Although the Princess is constantly at odds with Han, romance blossoms; while hiding in a cave (actually the mouth of a space slug), she shares her first kiss with the scruffy-looking <a href="Corellia" title="wikilink">Corellian</a> <a href="smuggling" title="wikilink">smuggler</a>. Later, when they stop at <a href="Bespin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bespin</a> for repairs, Han's friend <a href="Lando_Calrissian" title="wikilink">Lando Calrissian</a> betrays them to Vader, who uses them as bait for Luke. Han is also used as a test subject for the carbon freezing chamber meant for Luke, and it is there that Leia finally confesses her love for Han. Vader then gives the frozen Han to <a href="bounty_hunter" title="wikilink">bounty hunter</a> <a href="Boba_Fett" title="wikilink">Boba Fett</a> to give to <a href="Jabba_the_Hutt" title="wikilink">Jabba the Hutt</a>, to whom Han owes a large <a href="debt" class="uri" title="wikilink">debt</a>. Later, Lando helps Leia, Chewbacca, and the two droids escape. While escaping, she senses that Luke is in trouble and makes them go back for him. They manage to save Luke, who is badly hurt after a near-fatal duel against Vader, who had revealed that he was his father.</p>
<h3 id="return-of-the-jedi"><em>Return of the Jedi</em></h3>
<p>Six months after Han is kidnapped, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, Luke (now nearly a Jedi Knight), and the droids go to <a href="Tatooine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatooine</a> to try to rescue him from Jabba the Hutt. Her part of the plan consists of posing as the <a href="Ubese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubese</a> <a href="bounty_hunter" title="wikilink">bounty hunter</a> <strong>Boussh</strong>, who is turning in <a href="Chewbacca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chewbacca</a> to Jabba. <img src="leiabikini.jpg" title="fig:Leia in her golden slavegirl &quot;bikini&quot; outfit." alt="Leia in her golden slavegirl &quot;bikini&quot; outfit." width="250" /> By using a thermal detonator in her negotiations for a bounty, she gains the trust and respect of both Jabba and the notorious bounty hunter <a href="Boba_Fett" title="wikilink">Boba Fett</a> (who had, in fact, delivered Han Solo to Jabba in the first place.) Leia is discovered by Jabba and his cronies just as she has freed Han from his frozen imprisonment. As punishment, <a href="Jabba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jabba</a> has a <a href="Gammorean_Guard" title="wikilink">Gammorean Guard</a> bring her to himself and shove her closely against his body. She is then stripped completely by Jabba's lackeys and forced to wear the bikini, which is a symbol of being one of Jabba's beautiful slave girls. Over an unspecified period of time Leia endures the shame, disgust and humiliation of being chained to Jabba as his newest <a href="slavery" title="wikilink">slave</a> girl, dressed in the now-famous gold <a href="bikini" class="uri" title="wikilink">bikini</a>. Leia was treated with the same cruel lechery as his previous chained slave girls, such as the ill-fated dancer <a href="Minor_residents_of_Tatooine#Oola" title="wikilink">Oola</a>, until Luke arrived. After Luke slays Jabba's monstrous <a href="rancor" class="uri" title="wikilink">rancor</a>, he and Han are sentenced to be fed to a <a href="Sarlacc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarlacc</a> pit creature. Luke and Calrissian overpower Jabba's guards at the last minute, and Leia springs into action during the resulting confusion. She slips through Jabba's grip and grabs the chain that binds her, wraps it around Jabba's throat like a garrote and pulls, choking him to death. She escapes the sail barge and is reunited with Han, and returns to the Alliance.</p>
<p>While preparing for a last battle with <a href="Imperial_stormtrooper" title="wikilink">Imperial stormtroopers</a> on <a href="Endor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Endor</a>, Leia regains a faint memory of her birth mother and she tells Luke. Afterwards, Luke reveals to her that she is actually his twin sister, and that the hated Darth Vader is their father (Leia and Luke don't learn that Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; Amidala was their mother until around 35 ABY, although they do know of her as &quot;Senator Amidala.&quot;) Luke reveals to her that, if he fails, she the last Skywalker and heir to their Jedi legacy, and the only hope for the Rebels and the Jedi. She is stunned, but through her &quot;relation&quot; to the Force senses it's true and recovers sufficiently to lead the Rebels in battle on Endor as the Rebel Fleet battle the second Death Star.</p>
<p>On board the battle station, Emperor Palpatine goads Luke into fighting Vader, intent on making the young Jedi his new apprentice. Luke initially resists, but loses control when Vader <a href="telepathy" title="wikilink">telepathically</a> probes his mind, learns of Leia's existence, and threatens to convert <em>her</em> to the dark side. Enraged, Luke nearly kills Vader — until he realizes, at the last second, that doing so would doom him to his father's <a href="destiny" title="wikilink">fate</a>. He rejects Palpatine, who attacks him with <a href="Force_lightning#Dark" title="wikilink">Force lightning</a>. Vader then turns against and kills his master, and is mortally wounded in the process. In his dying breaths, the <a href="redemption" title="wikilink">redeemed</a> Anakin Skywalker pleads with Luke to tell Leia that there was still good in him after all.</p>
<p>Leia, meanwhile, leads the Rebels to victory on Endor as Lando and the Rebel fleet destroy the Death Star, and with it, the Empire.</p>
<h3 id="expanded-universe">Expanded Universe</h3>
<h4 id="alderaan">Alderaan</h4>
<p>As the heir to the Alderaanian throne, Leia also serves in the legislative High Council of Alderaan and a term as Galactic/Imperial Senator of Alderaan. After the Rebellion's victory on Endor, she establishes <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(M-N)#New_Alderaan" title="wikilink">New Alderaan</a>, a sanctuary for the destroyed planet's surviving inhabitants. The Royal House of Alderaan, in the person of Leia Organa Solo and her children, continues to hold <a href="sovereignty" class="uri" title="wikilink">sovereignty</a> over both New Alderaan and the old Alderaan system. Her title is largely ceremonial, however, as the government on New Alderaan actually administers the Alderaan system and New Alderaan in her name. Alderaan thus has been ruled under what seems to be a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>Although her relation to Darth Vader became public knowledge after the Empire's destruction, she remained known as the heir of Queen Breha and Bail Organa, and thus a member of the Royal House of Alderaan.</p>

<p>Leia briefly appears in the <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a> <a href="TV_movie" title="wikilink">TV movie</a> <em><a href="The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special" title="wikilink">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em>, where she is once again portrayed by <a href="Carrie_Fisher" title="wikilink">Carrie Fisher</a>. In the show, Leia is a leader and administrator of the new Rebel Alliance base. She is accompanied by C-3PO when contacting Chewbacca's wife, <a href="Mallatobuck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mallatobuck</a>, for assistance in finding Chewbacca and Han. She also appears in the <a href="cartoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">cartoon</a> <a href="segment_(broadcasting)" title="wikilink">segment</a> at a different Rebel Base, located in an <a href="asteroid_field" title="wikilink">asteroid field</a>, and at the <a href="Life_Day" title="wikilink">Life Day</a> ceremony at the end of the film. (Carrie Fisher reportedly claims she was &quot;heavily medicated&quot; during the performance.)</p>
<h4 id="the-truce-at-bakura"><em>The Truce at Bakura</em></h4>
<p>As depicted in the novel <em><a href="The_Truce_at_Bakura" title="wikilink">The Truce at Bakura</a></em>, immediately after the <a href="Battle_of_Endor" title="wikilink">Battle of Endor</a>, the Rebel Alliance receives a long-range messenger droid from <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(A-B)#Bakura" title="wikilink">Bakura</a>, which is under invasion by the <a href="Ssi-ruuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ssi-ruuk</a>. As Bakura is a well-armed system, which despite its remoteness produced important war-material (such as repulsorlift cells) the battered Alliance decides to dispatch a task force to aid the Bakurans; Leia and Luke are both assigned for their diplomatic and martial skills. The remaining Imperial forces gather at Bakura gratefully receive the aid once the Rebels' victory at Endor were made known to them, and a truce between the Imperials and the Rebels is signed. It is during this time that the spirit of Anakin Skywalker appears to Leia to beg for her forgiveness, which she cannot grant at that time.</p>
<h4 id="the-new-republic">The New Republic</h4>
<p>Princess Organa is a founding member of the <a href="New_Republic_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">New Republic</a>, which is formally promulgated in 5 <a href="Dates_in_Star_Wars" title="wikilink">ABY</a>. She succeeds <a href="Mon_Mothma" title="wikilink">Mon Mothma</a> as its Chancellor, and later fills other offices, such as Chief of Defense and various diplomatic posts. Although most of her life is devoted to such matters of state, she engages in limited study of the Jedi arts, with Luke as her teacher. Notably, she wields a blue <a href="lightsaber" class="uri" title="wikilink">lightsaber</a> that she built herself, and then Luke gives her a red one (not of Sith construction) to complement the weapon she had constructed earlier.</p>
<p>After a near-disastrous courtship in which <a href="Prince_Isolder" title="wikilink">Prince Isolder</a> vies for Leia's affections, she marries Han in 8 ABY. As described in <em><a href="The_Courtship_of_Princess_Leia" title="wikilink">The Courtship of Princess Leia</a></em>, Han kidnaps Leia and takes her to a planet he had won in a game of <a href="sabacc" class="uri" title="wikilink">sabacc</a> named <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(C-D)#Dathomir" title="wikilink">Dathomir</a>. There they encounter the <a href="Nightsisters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nightsisters</a>, whose attempt to escape eventually leads to the demise of the <a href="Warlord_Zsinj" title="wikilink">Warlord Zsinj</a> and his empire, equal rival at this time to both the <a href="Imperial_Remnant" title="wikilink">Imperial Remnant</a> and the New Republic.</p>
<p>At first, Leia does not want to have children, fearing they would succumb to the dark side as her father had done. In the Expanded Universe novel <em><a href="Tatooine_Ghost" title="wikilink">Tatooine Ghost</a></em>, however, she begins to understand what happened to her father to bring him to the dark side. When she and Han go on a mission to Tatooine to retrieve the Alderaanian moss-painting <em>Killik Twilight</em> and the Rebel code hidden within it, Leia discovers her grandmother <a href="Shmi_Skywalker" title="wikilink">Shmi Skywalker</a>'s diary and, with the help of her father's childhood friends <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_Old_Republic_characters#Kitster" title="wikilink">Kitster</a> and <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_Old_Republic_characters#Wald" title="wikilink">Wald</a>, discovers her father wasn't the monster she thought he was, and eventually learns to forgive him.</p>
<p>A year later during the <a href="The_Thrawn_trilogy" title="wikilink">Thrawn Crisis</a>, <a href="Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" title="wikilink">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a>, who had formed an alliance with <a href="Joruus_C&#39;Baoth" title="wikilink">Joruus C'Baoth</a>, orders <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_races#Noghri" title="wikilink">Noghri</a> commandos to kidnap Leia, who was <a href="pregnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnant</a>. C'Baoth intended to warp Leia and Luke to the dark side, and planned to corrupt also the two unborn twins, as he was aware of their great promise and minimal resistance to being molded to his whims. To avoid capture, she hides on the planet Kashyyyk, but her would-be kidnappers track her down. She later learns that Vader once landed on the Noghri home-planet <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(H-J)#Honoghr" title="wikilink">Honoghr</a> and tricked the Noghri into serving the Empire by promising to help their planet recover from the ecological disaster that it suffered during the <a href="Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)" title="wikilink">Clone Wars</a>. Because of this, they were fiercely loyal to Vader. Leia is able to leverage her biological relationship to Vader to persuade a Noghri <a href="assassin" class="uri" title="wikilink">assassin</a> to travel with her to Honoghr and help convince the Noghri of the Empire's deception. Leia shows an assembly of Noghri <a href="matriarch" title="wikilink">matriarchs</a> that the droids which the Empire demanded are actively poisoning the land and slowing down the reconstruction. They leave the service of the Empire after one of their assassins (and Thrawn's personal bodyguard), <a href="Rukh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rukh</a>, kills Thrawn during the <a href="Battle_of_Bilbringi" title="wikilink">Battle of Bilbringi</a> and becomes allies of New Republic (although it is unknown whether the assassination actually occurred due to Noghri outrage at the deception and exploitation, or, like many other prominent Imperials who died or disappeared mysteriously at this time, it was at the instigation of the Emperor Reborn). For her efforts, Leia is known as &quot;Lady Vader&quot; among the Noghri, and she and her family become revered figures in their society.</p>
<p>During the Thrawn Crisis, Leia gives birth to the twins <a href="Jaina_Solo" title="wikilink">Jaina</a> and <a href="Jacen_Solo" title="wikilink">Jacen</a> on <a href="Coruscant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coruscant</a> during Thrawn's siege.</p>
<h4 id="dark-empire">Dark Empire</h4>
<p>During the events of <em><a href="Dark_Empire" title="wikilink">Dark Empire</a></em>, the New Republic suffers severe setbacks, losing most of its worlds, as well as Luke Skywalker to the dark side. After her brother's capture on Coruscant, subsequent transport to <a href="Byss" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byss</a>, and corruption by the cloned Emperor, a pregnant Leia along with her husband, Han Solo, reach the Emperor's new stronghold of Byss where she confronts the reincarnated Emperor. At first Leia is unsuccesful in turning Luke away from the Dark Side, but does manage to take a Jedi Holocron away from the Emperors chambers. Leia boards the Emperor's <em>Eclipse</em>-class <a href="Star_Destroyer" title="wikilink">Super Star Destroyer</a> during its assault on the Pinnacle Moon of Da Soocha. She appeals to the goodness inside Luke, redeeming him, and assaults Palpatine with the light side of the Force, cutting him off from the dark side and control of the titanic <a href="Force_powers" title="wikilink">Force-storm</a> he had exerted himself to the utmost to conjure, intending to utterly obliterate the Rebel Alliance fleet. The <em>Eclipse I</em> and Palpatine are both destroyed.</p>
<p>During <a href="Operation_Shadow_Hand" title="wikilink">Operation Shadow Hand</a>, the Rebel Alliance continues to flee. Leia's second son, born in 10 ABY on a space station-turned-into-Alliance-base in orbit around <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(M-N)#Nespis_VIII" title="wikilink">Nespis VIII</a>, is given the name <a href="Anakin_Solo" title="wikilink">Anakin</a> in honor of her father's <a href="redemption" class="uri" title="wikilink">redemption</a> (See <a href="Solo_family" title="wikilink">Solo family</a>.)</p>
<p>Along with a Jedi named Jen, she defeats Palpatine's second-in-command, a <a href="Dark_Jedi" title="wikilink">Dark Jedi</a> assassin.</p>
<p>Even this respite proves to be short, however, as Palpatine is reborn in his last remaining clone body, which is quickly deteriorating, thanks to sabotage by <a href="List_of_minor_Star_Wars_characters#Jax,_Carnor" title="wikilink">Carnor Jax</a> and one of the <a href="Emperor&#39;s_Hand" title="wikilink">Emperor's Hands</a>. Leia is forced to flee to <a href="Onderon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Onderon</a> to hide Anakin from Palpatine, who intends to inject his spirit into the young infant. The Emperor did eventually find her, but Han accidentally shoots him in the back just as he is about to possess the baby. A sacrifice by a dying <a href="List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Jedi_knights#Brand,_Empatojayos" title="wikilink">Empatojayos Brand</a> saves them both from Palpatine's spirit, and finally destroys the tyrant once and for all.</p>
<p>As Chief of State, Leia guides the New Republic through a number of dangerous external crises from post-Imperial warlords. As the threat of Imperial warlords diminishes and the New Republic's growth accelerates rapidly, she also faces a number of internal political conflicts in the <a href="Third_Electoral" title="wikilink">Third Electoral</a>. These two forces come to a head during the <a href="The_Black_Fleet_Crisis" title="wikilink">Black Fleet crisis</a> in 16 ABY, in which she invoked Article Five of the <a href="Common_Charter" title="wikilink">Common Charter</a> to forestall a recall vote against her office and declare war against the <a href="List_of_Star_Wars_races#Yevetha" title="wikilink">Yevetha</a>. Cracks in her widespread popularity begin to show during this period, cracks that would accelerate with the political ascendance of the canny Bothan politician, <a href="Borsk_Fey&#39;lya" title="wikilink">Borsk Fey'lya</a>.</p>
<h4 id="the-yuuzhan-vong-war-and-beyond-25-aby35-aby">The <a href="Yuuzhan_Vong_War" title="wikilink">Yuuzhan Vong War</a> and beyond (25 ABY–35 ABY)</h4>
<p>After serving a second term, Leia resignes as Chief of State, and is replaced by Borsk Fey'lya. After the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Sernpidal in 25 ABY, Leia goes before the Senate to bring attention to the threat posed by the approaching <a href="Yuuzhan_Vong" title="wikilink">Yuuzhan Vong</a>. Her pleas go unheeded, and the Vong legions swarm into the galaxy, destroying system afters system and defeating the Jedi and the New Republic army at countless battles. Sometimes, even the might of Luke, Leia, their friends and allies couldn't prevent the dark victory of the Invaders. Leia, her chidren, Han Solo and their friends could definitively see that the invaders were winning the war, but Borsk Fey'lya and his supporters concluded the New Republic army and navy were taking advantages.</p>
<p>Leia contributes to the war effort by joining SELCORE, a movement that aided refugees.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Chewbacca's death sends Han into a deep <a href="depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depression</a>, causing a large rift between him and Leia, culminating in his walking out of the marriage after an argument. They patch things up after Leia is gravely wounded by Tsavong Lah at the Battle of Duro. Their troubles were not yet over, however; When the Vong unleashed the ultimate slayers, the voxyn, to find and kill all the Jedi, Leia was targeted by a Voxyn master slayer who had already killed many Jedi. With the help of her Noghri bodyguards, she eliminated the assassin with her lightsaber. Soon after, in 27 ABY, Leia and Han lost their youngest son, Anakin, during the Myrkr mission and the fall of Coruscant.</p>
<p>After Coruscant's fall, Han and Leia go to Hapes for Anakin's funeral, then on several missions to restore <a href="HoloNet" class="uri" title="wikilink">HoloNet</a> communications to the Unknown Regions, including foiling a second attempt of the Ssi-ruuk to invade Bakura in the process. Leia helped a the Pwecks to rebel on their masters during her confrontation face to face with the Imperium her stand allowed a few traitors to back stab the Imperium.</p>
<p>Near the end of the Yuuzhan Vong war, she and Han Solo rescued Thorsh, a prisoner from the internment camps of planet Selvaris. Later, her husband and she entered with Kyp Durron, Jedi Master, Wraw, a Bothan secret agent and a few more allies on the planet Callulla. They found that Alpha Red was released on this world. During the battle with the ill Yuuzhan Vong warriors she managed to destroy a few Slayers and a Commander before being captured. The commando was eventually rescued by Lando Calrissian, Talon Karrde and Tendra, Lando's wife.</p>
<p>When <a href="Zonama_Sekot" title="wikilink">Zonama Sekot</a> makes its existence known near Coruscant in 30 ABY, Han and Leia travel there to be reunited with the rest of their family. While there, they meet Harrar, a Yuuzhan Vong priest. Leia, Han, and a few companions work with Harrar and a group of heretics (Yuuzhan Vong Shamed Ones) to get inside the Well of the World Brain on Coruscant.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Shimrra and Supreme Overlord Onimi, Nom Anor travels with the Solo's Twins and their parents across the labyrinth to espace the mighty war vessel of the Master Shaper. However, the executor turns on them and shoots his venom towards Han Solo but Jacen catches the poison, saving his father from certain death. Leia engages the Prefect before he can eliminate her husband and her elder son. Darth Vader's daughter proves victorious and cuts off the rogue Nom Anor's arm. The beautiful princess and the former smuggler allow the executor to die on the mighty war vessel but do not witness his certain death.</p>
<p>Leia is among those gathered on Zonama. She gives up politics and becomes Han's copilot, a position she holds for the next five years.</p>
<h4 id="the-dark-nest">The <a href="Dark_Nest" title="wikilink">Dark Nest</a></h4>
<p>In 35 ABY, Han and Leia follow various Jedi who had disappeared into the Unknown Regions, and discover Raynar Thul was alive and had been taken in by a nest of Killiks. To avoid a war with the Chiss, Leia suggests to &quot;UnuThul&quot; (as Raynar was now known) that the Killik nest be moved to a new planet, but makes him think it was his idea. At this time, Leia comes to terms with her heritage and asks Saba Sebatyne to train her as a Jedi Knight, as per a promise Luke had made to her during the Thrawn crisis.</p>
<p>Around this time, R2-D2 suffers some severe malfunctions and shows Luke a holoclip of his father and a pregnant woman, whom Luke learns is his and Leia's real mother. In the holoclips, Anakin and Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; are discussing a dream of Anakin's in which Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; dies in childbirth. Before Luke can get more info out of R2, the droid has a meltdown, claiming he is protecting information. Frustrated, Luke contacts master slicer Ghent, who manages to recover one other holoclip from R2, this time featuring a scene in which Padm&lt;U+00E9&gt; is talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi about Anakin, which is displayed to both Luke and Leia. In the Swarm War, Luke and Leia finally see their mother's death. Also, Sebatyne tells Leia to constuct a new lightsaber to show she is a true Jedi Knight.</p>
<p>During the Swarm war, she defeats the evil Joiner Alemar Rar, a former Jedi champion. She vanquishes one of the strongest students the New Jedi Order had ever known.</p>
<p>Leia and Han become grandparents to Allana, Jacen's daughter, in 36 ABY.</p>
