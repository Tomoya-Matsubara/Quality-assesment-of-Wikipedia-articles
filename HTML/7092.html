<p><strong><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></strong> is an epic <a href="high_fantasy" title="wikilink">high fantasy</a> novel by the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> author <a href="J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier fantasy book <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, but soon developed into a much larger story. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it being written during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages, perhaps becoming the most popular work in twentieth-century <a href="literature" class="uri" title="wikilink">literature</a>.</p>
<p>The action in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is set in what is conceived to be the lands of the real <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a>, inhabited by humanity but placed in a fictional time. Tolkien gave this setting a modern <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> name, <a href="Middle-earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middle-earth</a>, a rendering of the <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <em><a href="Midgard" title="wikilink">Middangeard</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The story concerns peoples such as <a href="Hobbit" title="wikilink">Hobbits</a>, <a href="Elf_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Elves</a>, <a href="Man_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Men</a>, <a href="Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Dwarves</a>, <a href="Wizard_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Wizards</a> and <a href="Goblin" title="wikilink">Goblins</a> (whom Tolkien calls <a href="Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Orcs</a>), and centres on the <a href="One_Ring" title="wikilink">Ring of Power</a> made by the Dark Lord <a href="Sauron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sauron</a>. Starting from quiet beginnings in <a href="Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">The Shire</a>, the story ranges across Middle-earth and follows the courses of the <a href="War_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">War of the Ring</a>. The main story is followed by six appendices that provide a wealth of historical and linguistic background material.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with Tolkien's other writings, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has been subjected to extensive <a href="Themes_in_&quot;The_Lord_of_the_Rings&quot;" title="wikilink">analysis</a> of its <a href="theme_(literature)" title="wikilink">literary themes</a> and origins. Although a major work in itself, the story is merely the last movement of a larger <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> cycle, or <a href="legendarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">legendarium</a>, that Tolkien had worked on for many years since 1917.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, include <a href="philology" class="uri" title="wikilink">philology</a>, <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a> and <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a>, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> in its turn is considered to have had a great impact on modern fantasy, and the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words <a href="Tolkienian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tolkienian</a> and <a href="Tolkienesque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tolkienesque</a> have been recorded in the <a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The immense and enduring popularity of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has led to <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_in_pop_culture" title="wikilink">numerous references in popular culture</a>, the founding of many societies by <a href="Tolkien_fandom" title="wikilink">fans of Tolkien's works</a>, and a large number of books about Tolkien and his works being published. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> <a href="Works_inspired_by_J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">has inspired</a>, (and continues to inspire), short stories, <a href="Middle-earth_in_video_games" title="wikilink">video games</a>, artworks and musical works. Numerous adaptations of Tolkien's works have been made for a wide range of media. Adaptations of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> in particular have been made for the radio, for the theatre, and for film. The 2001-2003 release of <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> film trilogy saw a surge of interest in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and Tolkien's other works.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="back-story">Back story</h2>

<p>The back story begins thousands of years before the action in the book, with the rise of the eponymous Lord of the Rings, the Dark Lord <a href="Sauron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sauron</a>, a malevolent incarnated spiritual being who possesses great supernatural powers and who will later become the ruler of the dreaded realm of <a href="Mordor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mordor</a>. At the end of the <a href="First_Age" title="wikilink">First Age</a> of Middle-earth, Sauron survives the catastrophic defeat and exile of his master, the Devil-like figure, <a href="Morgoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morgoth</a>. During the <a href="Second_Age" title="wikilink">Second Age</a>, Sauron schemes to gain dominion over Middle-earth. In disguise as &quot;Annatar&quot;, or <em>Lord of Gifts</em>, he aids <a href="Celebrimbor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celebrimbor</a> and the other Elven-smiths of <a href="Eregion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eregion</a> in the forging of the <a href="Rings_of_Power" title="wikilink">Rings of Power</a>, but then secretly forges the <a href="One_Ring" title="wikilink">One Ring</a> by which he can enslave the wearers of the Rings of Power. This plan fails when the Elves become aware of him and take off their Rings. Sauron then launches a war during which he captures the <a href="Seven_Rings" title="wikilink">Seven Rings</a> and the <a href="Nine_Rings" title="wikilink">Nine Rings</a> and distributes them to lords and kings of Dwarves and Men respectively. The dwarf-lords prove too tough to enslave, but the men who possess the Nine are slowly corrupted over time and eventually become the <a href="Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l</a>, his most feared servants. The <a href="Three_Rings" title="wikilink">Three</a>, he fails to capture, and they remain in the possession of the Elves. The war ends as the <a href="N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;rean" title="wikilink">N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;reans</a> help the besieged Elves, and Sauron's forces retreat from the coasts of Eriador. At this time he still held most of Middle-earth, excluding Imladris (<a href="Rivendell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rivendell</a>) and the <a href="Gulf_of_Lune" title="wikilink">Lune</a>.</p>
<p><img src="NumenorEN.jpg" title="fig:A map of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor (called Andor by the Elves)." alt="A map of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor (called Andor by the Elves)." width="200" /> Over 1500 years later, word reaches the then king of <a href="N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor" class="uri" title="wikilink">N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor</a>, <a href="Ar-Pharaz&lt;U+00F4&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ar-Pharaz&lt;U+00F4&gt;n</a>, that Sauron has been bearing the title 'Lord of All Middle-Earth'. This provokes Ar-Pharaz&lt;U+00F4&gt;n and gives him an opportunity to show the glory and strength of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor. He arrives in Middle-earth with such overwhelming force that Sauron's armies flee at the sight of them. Abandoned by his minions, Sauron surrenders to the N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;reans, and is taken to N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor as a 'prisoner'. Sauron then starts to poison the minds of the N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;reans against the angelic powers of the world, the <a href="Valar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valar</a>. Thus, Sauron sets into motion the events that bring about N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor's destruction. He does this by corrupting the King's mind, telling him that the immortality of the Elves is his to take if he sets foot upon the Blessed Lands. With old age on his mind, Ar-Pharaz&lt;U+00F4&gt;n leads an invasion of <a href="Valinor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valinor</a> with the greatest host seen since the War of Wrath. Manw&lt;U+00EB&gt;, King of the Valar, calls upon <a href="Il&lt;U+00FA&gt;vatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Il&lt;U+00FA&gt;vatar</a>, who opens a great chasm in the sea, destroying N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor, and removes the Undying Lands from the mortal world. The destruction of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor nearly destroys Sauron, but he returns in spirit form to Mordor and assumes a new form. Over 100 years later, he launches an attack against the N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;rean exiles (the Faithful), that had escaped to Middle-earth. However, the exiles (led by <a href="Elendil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elendil</a> and his sons <a href="Isildur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isildur</a> and <a href="An&lt;U+00E1&gt;rion" class="uri" title="wikilink">An&lt;U+00E1&gt;rion</a>) have time to prepare, and, forming the <a href="Last_Alliance_of_Elves_and_Men" title="wikilink">Last Alliance of Elves and Men</a> with the Elven-king <a href="Gil-galad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gil-galad</a>, they march against Mordor and besiege <a href="Barad-d&lt;U+00FB&gt;r" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barad-d&lt;U+00FB&gt;r</a>, at which time An&lt;U+00E1&gt;rion is slain. After seven years of siege, Sauron himself is ultimately forced to engage in single combat with the leaders. Gil-galad and Elendil perish as they combat Sauron, and Elendil's sword <a href="Narsil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narsil</a> breaks beneath him. However, Sauron is overcome, and Isildur cuts the One Ring from Sauron's hand with the hilt-shard of Narsil, and at this Sauron's spirit flees and does not reappear for many centuries.</p>
<p>So begins the <a href="Third_Age" title="wikilink">Third Age</a> of Middle-earth. Two years later, while journeying to <a href="Rivendell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rivendell</a>, Isildur and his soldiers are ambushed by a band of <a href="Orcs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orcs</a> and killed at the <a href="Disaster_of_the_Gladden_Fields" title="wikilink">Disaster of the Gladden Fields</a>. The Ring slips from his finger into the Great River <a href="Anduin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anduin</a> and is lost for millennia. In <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, set 60 years before the events in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Tolkien relates the story of the seemingly accidental finding of the Ring by the <a href="hobbit" class="uri" title="wikilink">hobbit</a>, <a href="Bilbo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Bilbo Baggins</a>. Story-externally, the tale related in <em>The Hobbit</em> was written before <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and it was only later that the author developed Bilbo's magic ring into the &quot;One Ring&quot;. Neither Bilbo nor the wizard, <a href="Gandalf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandalf</a>, are aware at this point that Bilbo's magic ring is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p><img src="Middle_earth_map_showing_prominent_locations.PNG" title="fig:Middle-earth during the Third Age" alt="Middle-earth during the Third Age" width="250" /> <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> takes up the story about 60 years after the end of <em>The Hobbit</em>. The story begins in the first volume, <em><a href="The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>, when <a href="Frodo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Frodo Baggins</a>, Bilbo's adoptive heir, comes into possession of Bilbo's magic ring. Bilbo's old friend, <a href="Gandalf" title="wikilink">Gandalf the Grey</a>, who got Bilbo involved in the adventures in <em>The Hobbit</em> that led to the discovery of the ring, discovers that the ring is in fact the <a href="One_Ring" title="wikilink">One Ring</a>, the instrument of Sauron's power and the object for which the Dark Lord has been searching for most of the Third Age, and which corrupts others with desire for it and the power it holds.</p>
<p>Sauron sends his servants, the sinister <a href="Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l</a> or Ringwraiths (in the guise of riders in black) to the Shire in search of the Ring. Frodo, with the help of his loyal servant <a href="Samwise_Gamgee" title="wikilink">Sam Gamgee</a> and two close friends, <a href="Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="wikilink">Merry Brandybuck</a> and <a href="Peregrin_Took" title="wikilink">Pippin Took</a>, and later a man called &quot;Strider&quot;, smuggles the Ring to <a href="Rivendell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rivendell</a> on Gandalf's request. At Rivendell, &quot;Strider&quot; is revealed to be <a href="Aragorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aragorn</a>, the heir to the kingship of <a href="Gondor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondor</a> and <a href="Arnor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arnor</a>, two great realms of <a href="Man_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Men</a>. The hobbits also learn that Sauron's forces can only be resisted if Aragorn takes up his inheritance and fulfils an ancient prophecy by wielding the sword <a href="Narsil" title="wikilink">And&lt;U+00FA&gt;ril</a>, which has been forged anew from the shards of <a href="Narsil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narsil</a>, the sword that cut the Ring from Sauron's finger in the Second Age. A high council, attended by representatives of the major races of Middle-earth; Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and presided over by the <a href="Half-elven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Half-elven</a> Lord <a href="Elrond" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elrond</a>, decides that the only course of action that can save Middle-earth is to destroy the Ring by taking it to Mordor and casting it into <a href="Mount_Doom" title="wikilink">Mount Doom</a>, where it was forged.</p>
<p>Frodo volunteers for the task, and a &quot;<a href="Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(characters)" title="wikilink">Fellowship of the Ring</a>&quot; is formed to aid him &lt;U+2014&gt; consisting of Frodo himself, Gandalf, Aragorn, <a href="Boromir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boromir</a> of Gondor, <a href="Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Gimli</a> the Dwarf, <a href="Legolas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Legolas</a> the Elf, and his three Hobbit companions. Their journey takes them through the Mines of <a href="Moria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moria</a>, where they are followed by the wretched creature <a href="Gollum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gollum</a>, whom Bilbo had met in the Goblin-caves of the Misty Mountains years before. (The full tale of their meeting is told in <em>The Hobbit</em>.) Gollum had long possessed the Ring before it passed to Bilbo. Gandalf explains that Gollum belonged to a people &quot;of hobbit-kind&quot; before he came upon the Ring, which corrupted him. A slave to the Ring's evil power, Gollum desperately seeks to regain his &quot;Precious&quot;. As they proceed through the Mines, Pippin unintentionally betrays their presence and the party is attacked by creatures of Sauron. Gandalf battles a giant subterranean demon, the <a href="Balrog" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balrog</a>, and falls into a deep chasm, apparently to his death. Escaping from Moria, the Fellowship, now led by Aragorn, goes to the Elven realm of <a href="Lothl&lt;U+00F3&gt;rien" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lothl&lt;U+00F3&gt;rien</a>. Here, the Lady <a href="Galadriel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galadriel</a> shows Frodo and Sam visions of the past, present, and future. Frodo also sees the <a href="Eye_of_Sauron" title="wikilink">Eye of Sauron</a>, a metaphysical expression of Sauron himself, and Galadriel tempted by the Ring. By the end of the first volume, after the Fellowship has travelled along the great River <a href="Anduin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anduin</a>, Frodo decides to continue the trek to Mordor on his own, largely due to the Ring's growing influence on Boromir; however, the faithful Sam insists on going with him.</p>
<p>In the second volume, <em><a href="The_Two_Towers" title="wikilink">The Two Towers</a></em>, a parallel story, told in the first book of the volume, details the exploits of the remaining members of the Fellowship who aid the country of <a href="Rohan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rohan</a> in its war against the emerging evil of <a href="Saruman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saruman</a>, leader of the Order of Wizards, whom Sauron has helped corrupt, and who wants the Ring for himself. At the start of the first book, the Fellowship is further scattered; Merry and Pippin are captured by Sauron and Saruman's Orcs, Boromir is mortally wounded defending them, and Aragorn and the others go off in pursuit of their captors. The three meet Gandalf, who has returned to Middle-earth as &quot;Gandalf the White&quot;: We find out that he slew the Balrog of Moria, and although the battle also proved fatal to Gandalf, he was then &quot;reborn&quot; with greater powers. At the end of the first book, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli help defeat Saruman's armies at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Hornburg" title="wikilink">Battle of the Hornburg</a> while Saruman himself is cornered by the tree-like <a href="Ents" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ents</a> and <a href="Huorns" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huorns</a>, accompanied by Merry and Pippin, who have escaped from captivity.</p>
<p>The second book of the volume tells of Frodo and Sam's exploits on the way to Mount Doom. They manage to capture and &quot;tame&quot; Gollum, who then shows them a way to enter Mordor secretly (as opposed to the <a href="Black_Gate" title="wikilink">Black Gate</a>), albeit through the dread realm of <a href="Minas_Morgul" title="wikilink">Minas Morgul</a>. At the end of the volume, Gollum betrays Frodo to the great spider, <a href="Shelob" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shelob</a>, and though he survives he is captured by Orcs. Meanwhile, Sauron launches an all-out military assault upon Middle-earth, with the <a href="Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="wikilink">Witch-king</a> (leader of the Ringwraiths) leading a fell host from Minas Morgul into battle against <a href="Gondor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondor</a>, in the <a href="War_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">War of the Ring</a>.</p>
<p>In the third volume, <em><a href="The_Return_of_the_King" title="wikilink">The Return of the King</a></em>, the further exploits of Gandalf, Aragorn and company are related in the first book of the volume, while Frodo and Sam's are related in the second, as with <em>The Two Towers</em>. As told in the first book, the Fellowship assists in the final battles against the armies of Sauron, including the siege of the tower-city of <a href="Minas_Tirith" title="wikilink">Minas Tirith</a> in Gondor and the climactic life-or-death battle before the <a href="Black_Gate" title="wikilink">Black Gate</a> of Mordor, where the alliance of Gondor and Rohan fights desperately against Sauron's armies in order to distract him from the Ring, hoping to gain time for Frodo to destroy it.</p>
<p>In the second book, Sam rescues Frodo from captivity. After much struggle, they finally reach Mount Doom itself, tailed by Gollum. However, the temptation of the Ring proves too great for Frodo and he claims it for himself. However, Gollum struggles with him and manages to bite the Ring off. Crazed with triumph, Gollum slips into the fires of the mountain, and the Ring is destroyed.</p>
<p>Finally, Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn is crowned king. However, all is not over, for Saruman manages to escape and despoil the Shire. At the end, Frodo remains wounded in body and spirit, and goes west over the Sea to Valinor, where he can find peace.</p>
<p>According to Tolkien's <a href="Timeline_of_Arda" title="wikilink">timeline</a>, the events depicted in the story occurred between Bilbo's announcement of his  birthday party, and Sam's re-arrival to Bag End on . Most of the events portrayed in the story occur in 3018 and 3019, with Frodo heading out from Bag End on , and the destruction of the Ring six months later on . </p>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was started as a sequel to <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, a fantasy story that Tolkien had written for, and read to, his children, which was published in 1937.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The popularity of <em>The Hobbit</em> led to demands from his publishers for more stories about Hobbits and <a href="goblins" class="uri" title="wikilink">goblins</a>, and so that same year, at the age of 45, Tolkien began writing the story that would become <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. The story would not be finished until 12 years later, in 1949, and it would not be fully published until 1955, by which time Tolkien was 63 years old.</p>
<p>Tolkien did not originally intend to write a sequel to <em>The Hobbit</em>, and instead wrote several other children's tales, including <em><a href="Roverandom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roverandom</a></em>. As his main work, Tolkien began to outline the history of <a href="Arda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arda</a>, telling tales of the <a href="Silmarils" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silmarils</a>, and many other stories of how the races and situations that we read about in the Lord of the Rings came to be. Tolkien died before he could complete and put together this work, today know as the <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em>, but his son <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher Tolkien</a> edited his father's work, filled in gaps, and published it in 1977.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Some Tolkien biographers regard <em>The Silmarillion</em> as the true &quot;work of his heart&quot;,&lt;ref &quot;shippey&quot;&gt;</ref> as it provides the historical and linguistic context for the more popular work and for <a href="Languages_of_Middle-earth" title="wikilink">his constructed languages</a>, and occupied the greater part of Tolkien's time. As a result <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> ended up as the last movement of Tolkien's legendarium and in his own as a &quot;much larger, and I hope also in proportion the best, of the entire cycle&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Persuaded by his publishers, he started 'a new Hobbit' in December 1937.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After several false starts, the story of the One Ring soon emerged, and the book mutated from being a <a href="sequel" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequel</a> to <em>The Hobbit</em>, to being, in theme, more a sequel to the unpublished <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">Silmarillion</a></em>. The idea of the first chapter (<em>A Long-Expected Party</em>) arrived fully-formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> did not arrive until the spring of 1938.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Originally, he planned to write another story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the ring and its powers and decided to write about it instead.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He began with Bilbo as the main character but decided that the story was too serious to use the fun-loving hobbit and so Tolkien looked to use a member of Bilbo's family.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He thought about using Bilbo's son but this generated some difficult questions — Where was his wife? How could Bilbo let his son go into that kind of danger? — so he looked for an alternate character to carry the ring. In Greek legend, it was a hero's nephew that gained the item of power, and so the hobbit Frodo came into existence.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing was slow due to Tolkien's perfectionism, and was frequently interrupted by his obligations as an <a href="examinations" title="wikilink">examiner</a>, and other academic duties. The first sentence of <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em> was in fact written on a blank page which a student had left on an exam paper which Tolkien was marking — &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He seems to have abandoned <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> during most of 1943 and only re-started it in April 1944.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This effort was written as a serial for <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher Tolkien</a> and <a href="C.S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C.S.

He made another push in 1946, and showed a copy of the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not finish revising earlier parts of the work until 1949.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>A dispute with his publishers, <a href="Allen_&amp;_Unwin" title="wikilink">Allen &amp; Unwin</a>, led to the book being offered to <a href="Collins" class="uri" title="wikilink">Collins</a> in 1950. He intended <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em> (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, but A&amp;U were unwilling to do this. After his contact at Collins, Milton Waldman, expressed the belief that <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> itself &quot;urgently needed cutting&quot;, he eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. They did not do so, and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying &quot;I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>
<p>For publication, due largely to post-war paper shortages, but also to keep the price of the first volume down, the book was divided into three volumes: <em><a href="The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>: Books I and II, <em><a href="The_Two_Towers" title="wikilink">The Two Towers</a></em>: Books III and IV, and <em><a href="The_Return_of_the_King" title="wikilink">The Return of the King</a></em>: Books V and VI plus 6 appendices. Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially indices led to these being published later than originally hoped — on <a href="29_July" title="wikilink">29 July</a> <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>, <a href="11_November" title="wikilink">11 November</a> <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a> and <a href="20_October" title="wikilink">20 October</a> <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a> respectively in the United Kingdom, slightly later in the United States. <em>The Return of the King</em> was especially delayed. Tolkien, moreover, did not especially like the title <em>The Return of the King</em>, believing it gave away too much of the storyline. He had originally suggested <em><a href="The_War_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">The War of the Ring</a></em>, which was dismissed by his publishers.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The books were published under a 'profit-sharing' arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits. An index to the entire 3-volume set at the end of third volume was promised in the first volume. However, this proved impractical to compile in a reasonable timescale. Later, in 1966, four indices, not compiled by Tolkien, were added to <em>The Return of the King</em>. Because the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> &quot;<a href="trilogy" class="uri" title="wikilink">trilogy</a>&quot;. In a letter to <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W. H. Auden</a>, Tolkien himself made use of the term &quot;trilogy&quot; for the work (<em><a href="The_Letters_of_J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien</a></em>, #163) though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book (<em>Letters</em>, #149). It is also often called a <a href="novel" class="uri" title="wikilink">novel</a>; however, Tolkien also objected to this term as he viewed it as a <a href="romance_(genre)" title="wikilink">romance</a> (<em>Letters</em>, #329; &quot;romance&quot; in this sense refers to a heroic tale).</p>
<p>A 1999 (Millennium Edition) British (ISBN 0-261-10387-3) 7-volume box set followed the six-book division authored by Tolkien, with the Appendices from the end of <em>The Return of the King</em> bound as a separate volume. The letters of <em>Tolkien</em> appeared on the spines of the boxed set which included a CD. To coincide with the film release, a new version of this popular edition was released featuring images from the films, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I - Frodo climbing the steps to Bag End</li>
<li>II - Aragorn and Arwen in Rivendell</li>
<li>III - Gandalf in Moria</li>
<li>IV - A swan boat from Lothl&lt;U+00F3&gt;rien</li>
<li>V - A Black Rider from the 'Flight to the Ford' sequence</li>
<li>VI - The tower of <a href="Cirith_Ungol" title="wikilink">Cirith Ungol</a> (although this image featured in many of the promotional books (e.g. the 'FotR Photo Guide') from the first film, it did not feature in the films until <em>Return of the King</em>)</li>
<li>App. - Frodo's hand holding the One Ring</li>
</ul>
<p>This new imprint (ISBN 0-007-63555-9) also omitted the CD. The individual names for books in this series were decided posthumously, based on a combination of suggestions Tolkien had made during his lifetime and the titles of the existing volumes — <a href="viz" class="uri" title="wikilink">viz</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>T Book I: <em>The Return of the Shadow</em></li>
<li>O Book II: <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em></li>
<li>L Book III: <em>The Treason of Isengard</em></li>
<li>K Book IV: <em>The Journey to Mordor</em></li>
<li>I Book V: <em>The War of the Ring</em></li>
<li>E Book VI: <em>The Return of the King</em></li>
<li>N Appendices</li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the complete work is often abbreviated to <strong>'LotR</strong>', <strong>'LOTR</strong>', or simply <strong>'LR</strong>' (Tolkien himself used <strong>L.R.</strong>), and the three volumes as FR, FOTR, or FotR (The <strong>F</strong>ellowship <strong>o</strong>f <strong>t</strong>he <strong>R</strong>ing), TT or TTT (<strong>T</strong>he <strong>T</strong>wo <strong>T</strong>owers), and RK, ROTK, or RotK (The <strong>R</strong>eturn <strong>o</strong>f <strong>t</strong>he <strong>K</strong>ing).</p>
<p>Note that the titles <em>The Return of the Shadow</em>, <em>The Treason of Isengard</em> and <em>The War of the Ring</em> were used by <a href="Christopher_Tolkien" title="wikilink">Christopher Tolkien</a> in <em><a href="The_History_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The History of The Lord of the Rings</a></em>.

<h3 id="publication-history">Publication history</h3>
<p>The three parts were first published by <a href="Allen_&amp;_Unwin" title="wikilink">Allen &amp; Unwin</a> in 1954–1955, several months apart. They have since been reissued many times by multiple publishers, as one, three, six or seven volume sets. The two most common current printings are ISBN 0-618-34399-7 (one-volume) and ISBN 0-618-34624-4 (three volume set). In the early 1960s, <a href="Donald_A._Wollheim" title="wikilink">Donald A. Wollheim</a>, <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> editor of the paperback publisher <a href="Ace_Books" title="wikilink">Ace Books</a>, realized that <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was not protected in the United States under <a href="United_States_copyright_law" title="wikilink">American copyright law</a> because the US hardcover edition had been bound from pages printed in the United Kingdom, with the original intention being for them to be printed in the British edition. Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without <a href="royalties" class="uri" title="wikilink">royalties</a> to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection. <a href="Grass-roots" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grass-roots</a> pressure from these fans became so great that Ace books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien, well below what he might have been due in an appropriate publication. However, this poor beginning was overshadowed when an authorized edition followed from <a href="Ballantine_Books" title="wikilink">Ballantine Books</a> to tremendous commercial success. By the mid-1960s the books, due to their wide exposure on the American public stage, had become a true cultural phenomenon. Also at this time Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would have a valid US copyright. This would later become known as the Second Edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>
<p>The books have been translated, with various degrees of success, into dozens of other languages.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Tolkien, an expert in <a href="philology" class="uri" title="wikilink">philology</a>, examined many of these translations, and had comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. To aid translators, Tolkien wrote his <em>Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings</em>. Because <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is said to be a translation of the <em><a href="Red_Book_of_Westmarch" title="wikilink">Red Book of Westmarch</a></em>, translators have an unusual degree of freedom when translating <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. This allows for such translations as <a href="elf" class="uri" title="wikilink">elf</a> becoming <em>Elb</em> in German - Elb does not carry the connotations of mischief that its English counterpart does and therefore is more true to the work that Tolkien created. In contrast to the usual modern practice, names intended to have a particular meaning in the English version are translated to provide a similar meaning in the target language: in German, for example, the name &quot;Baggins&quot; becomes &quot;Beutlin&quot;, containing the word <em>Beutel</em> meaning &quot;bag&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="influences">Influences</h3>
<p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> began as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in <a href="philology" class="uri" title="wikilink">philology</a>, <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a> (particularly <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a>), <a href="fairy_tale" title="wikilink">fairy tales</a>, as well as <a href="Norse_mythology" title="wikilink">Norse</a> and <a href="Celtic_mythology" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a>, but it was also crucially influenced by the effects of his military service during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Tolkien detailed his creation to an astounding extent; he created a complete mythology for his realm of Middle-earth, including genealogies of characters, languages, <a href="writing_system" title="wikilink">writing systems</a>, calendars and histories. Some of this supplementary material is detailed in the appendices to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and the mythological history woven into a large, Biblically-styled volume entitled <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em>. However many parts of the world he crafted, as he freely admitted, are influenced by others.</p>
<p>Tolkien's largest influences in the creation of his world were his Catholic faith and the Bible.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Tolkien once described <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to his friend, the English <a href="Society_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a> Father Robert Murray, as &quot;<em>a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.</em>&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of <a href="divine_grace" title="wikilink">grace</a>. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In addition the Lord's Prayer &quot;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil&quot; was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's struggles against the power of the One Ring.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Non-Christian religious motifs also had strong influences in Tolkien's Middle-earth. His <a href="Ainur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ainur</a>, a race of angelic beings who are responsible for <a href="Ainulindal&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">conceptualizing the world</a>, includes the <a href="Valar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valar</a>, the pantheon of &quot;gods&quot; who are responsible for the maintenance of everything from skies and seas to dreams and doom, and their servants, the <a href="Maiar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maiar</a>. The concept of the Valar echoes Greek and Norse mythologies, although the Ainur and <a href="Arda" title="wikilink">the world</a> itself are all creations of a monotheistic deity — <a href="Eru_Il&lt;U+00FA&gt;vatar" title="wikilink">Il&lt;U+00FA&gt;vatar or Eru, &quot;The One&quot;</a>. As the external practice of Middle-earth religion is downplayed in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, explicit information about them is only given in the different versions of <em>Silmarillion</em> material. However, there remain allusions to this aspect of Tolkien's mythos, including &quot;the Great Enemy&quot; who was Sauron's master and &quot;Elbereth, Queen of Stars&quot; (<a href="Morgoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morgoth</a> and <a href="Varda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Varda</a> respectively, two of the Valar) in the main text, the &quot;Authorities&quot; (referring to the Valar, literally <em>Powers</em>) in the Prologue, and &quot;the One&quot; in Appendix A. Other pre-Christian mythological references can be seen, including other sentient non-humans (Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits and Ents), a &quot;Green Man&quot; (<a href="Tom_Bombadil" title="wikilink">Tom Bombadil</a>), and spirits or ghosts (<a href="Barrow-wights" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barrow-wights</a>, <a href="Dead_Men_of_Dunharrow" title="wikilink">Oathbreakers</a>).</p>
<p>In addition <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was crucially influenced by Tolkien's experiences during World War I and his son's during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The central action of the books — a climactic, age-ending war between good and evil — is the central event of many world mythologies, notably Norse, but it is also a clear reference to the well-known description of World War I, which was commonly referred to as &quot;the war to end all wars&quot;. <img src="Tolkien_ring.jpg" title="fig:Artist&#39;s impression of The One Ring" alt="Artist&#39;s impression of The One Ring" width="220" /> After the publication of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> these influences led to speculation that the One Ring was an <a href="allegory" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegory</a> for the <a href="nuclear_bomb" title="wikilink">nuclear bomb</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Tolkien, however, repeatedly insisted that his works were not an allegory of any kind. However there is a strong theme of despair in the face of new mechanized warfare that Tolkien himself had experienced in the trenches of World War I. The development of a specially bred Orc army, and the destruction of the environment to aid this, also have modern resonances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tolkien states in the introduction to the books that he disliked allegories and that the story was not one,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and it would be irresponsible to dismiss such direct statements on these matters lightly. Tolkien had already completed most of the book, including the ending in its entirety, before the first nuclear bombs were made known to the world at <a href="Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> in August 1945.</p>
<p>While Tolkien plausibly denied any specific 'nuclear' reference, it is clear that the Ring has broad applicability to the concept of <a href="Absolute_Power" title="wikilink">Absolute Power</a> and its effects, and that the plot hinges on the view that anyone who seeks to gain absolute worldly power will inevitably be corrupted by it. Some also say there is also clear evidence that one of the main subtexts of the story — the passing of a mythical &quot;Golden Age&quot; — was influenced not only by Arthurian legend but also by Tolkien's contemporary anxieties about the growing encroachment of <a href="urbanization" class="uri" title="wikilink">urbanization</a> and <a href="industrialization" class="uri" title="wikilink">industrialization</a> into the &quot;traditional&quot; English lifestyle and countryside. The concept of the &quot;ring of power&quot; itself is also present in <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>'s Republic and in the story of Gyges' ring (a story often compared to the <a href="Book_of_Job" title="wikilink">Book of Job</a>). Many, however, believe Tolkien's most likely source was the Norse tale of <a href="Sigurd_the_Volsung" title="wikilink">Sigurd the Volsung</a>. Tolkien also based his elves' language <a href="Quenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quenya</a> on <a href="Finnish_language" title="wikilink">Finnish</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>
<p>Tolkien's work has received mixed reviews since its inception, ranging from terrible to excellent. Recent reviews in various media have been, in a majority, highly positive. On its initial review the <em><a href="Sunday_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Sunday Telegraph</a></em> felt it was &quot;among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century&quot;. The <em><a href="Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> seemed to echo these sentiments when in their review it was stated that &quot;the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> and those who are going to read them.&quot; The <a href="New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="wikilink">New York Herald Tribune</a> also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were &quot;destined to outlast our time.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all original reviews, however, were so kind. <em>New York Times</em> reviewer Judith Shulevitz criticized the &quot;pedantry&quot; of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he &quot;formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself.&quot; <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in <em><a href="The_New_Republic" title="wikilink">The New Republic</a></em>, criticized a perceived lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself are, according to Jenkyns, &quot;anemic, and lacking in fiber&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Even within Tolkien's social group, <a href="The_Inklings" title="wikilink">The Inklings</a>, reviews were mixed. <a href="Hugo_Dyson" title="wikilink">Hugo Dyson</a> was famously recorded as saying, during one of Tolkien's readings to the group, &quot;Oh no! Not another fucking elf!&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> However, another Inkling, <a href="C.S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C.S. Lewis</a>, had very different feelings, writing, &quot;here are the beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Several other authors in the genre, however, seemed to agree more with Dyson than Lewis. Science-fiction author <a href="David_Brin" title="wikilink">David Brin</a> criticized the books for what he perceived to be their unquestioning devotion to a traditional <a href="elitism" title="wikilink">elitist</a> social structure, their positive depiction of the slaughter of the opposing forces, and their <a href="romanticism" title="wikilink">romantic</a> backward-looking worldview.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <a href="Michael_Moorcock" title="wikilink">Michael Moorcock</a>, another famous science fiction and fantasy author, is also a fervent detractor of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. In his essay, &quot;<a href="Epic_Pooh" title="wikilink">Epic Pooh</a>&quot;, he equates Tolkien's work to <em><a href="Winnie-the-Pooh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> and criticizes it and similar works for their perceived <a href="Merry_England" title="wikilink">Merry England</a> point of view. <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Incidentally, Moorcock met both Tolkien and Lewis in his teens and claims to have liked them personally, even though he does not admire them on artistic grounds.</p>
<p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, despite not being published in paperback until the 1960s, sold well in hardback.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1957 it was awarded the <a href="International_Fantasy_Award" title="wikilink">International Fantasy Award</a>. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the <a href="Ace_Books" title="wikilink">Ace Books</a> and <a href="Ballantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballantine</a> paperbacks helped <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> become immensely popular in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In the 2003 &quot;<a href="Big_Read" title="wikilink">Big Read</a>&quot; survey conducted by the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was found to be the &quot;Nation's Best-loved Book&quot;.

His popularity is not limited just to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;Big Read&quot; survey, about 250,000 Germans found <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to be their favourite work of literature.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The rights to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> were held by <a href="Walt_Disney" title="wikilink">Walt Disney</a> for ten years, but the Disney company was unable to put together a film production.

<p><img src="Lord_of_the_Rings_Part_1(b).jpg" title="fig:Ralph Bakshi&#39;s The Lord of the Rings" alt="Ralph Bakshi&#39;s The Lord of the Rings" /> In 1978, shortly after the Rankin-Bass animated television film of <em><a href="The_Hobbit" title="wikilink">The Hobbit</a></em>, Saul Zaentz produced an <a href="animation" title="wikilink">animated</a> adaptation of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> and part of <em>The Two Towers</em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings Part 1</a></em> (later <em>J.R.R.

<p>The film was part one of what was originally to be a two-part adaptation of Tolkien's story, Part I ending after the battle of Helm's Deep, but before Sam, Frodo and Gollum traverse the <a href="Dead_Marshes" title="wikilink">Dead Marshes</a>, and Part II picking up from where the first left off. Made for a minimal budget of US$8 million, the film made over US$30 million dollars at the box office.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> However, United Artists viewed the film as a flop, and refused to fund a Part II (covering the rest of the story), leaving the door open for Rankin-Bass to do the work for him with the 1980 animated television version of <em><a href="The_Return_of_the_King_(1980_movie)" title="wikilink">The Return of the King</a></em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="new-line-cinema-films">New Line Cinema films</h4>

<p><a href="Miramax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miramax</a> Films developed a full-fledged <a href="live_action" title="wikilink">live action</a> adaptation of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with <a href="Peter_Jackson" title="wikilink">Peter Jackson</a> as director. Eventually, with Miramax owner <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disney</a> becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, Jackson was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1998, <a href="New_Line_Cinema" title="wikilink">New Line Cinema</a> assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives <a href="Bob_Weinstein" title="wikilink">Bob Weinstein</a> and <a href="Harvey_Weinstein" title="wikilink">Harvey Weinstein</a> retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive <a href="computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">computer-generated imagery</a>, including major battle scenes utilizing the &quot;<a href="Massive_(animation)" title="wikilink">Massive</a>&quot; software program. <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(film)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em> was released on <a href="December_19" title="wikilink">December 19</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers_(film)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em> on <a href="December_18" title="wikilink">December 18</a> <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> and <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(film)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></em> worldwide on <a href="December_17" title="wikilink">December 17</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>. All three won the <a href="Hugo_Award" title="wikilink">Hugo Award</a> for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.</p>
<p>The films were met with both critical and commercial success. Jackson's adaptations garnered seventeen Oscars, four for <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, two for <em>The Two Towers</em>, and eleven for <em>The Return of the King</em>; these covered many of the award categories. <em>The Return of the King</em> in fact won all of the eleven awards for which it was nominated, including Best Picture. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history, surpassing the <em><a href="The_Godfather" title="wikilink">Godfather</a></em> series' 28. Its 11 Oscars at the <a href="76th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">2004 Academy Awards</a> tied it for most awards won for one film with <em><a href="Titanic_(1997_film)" title="wikilink">Titanic</a></em> six years earlier and the 1959 version of <em><a href="Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="wikilink">Ben-Hur</a></em>. It also broke the previous &quot;sweep&quot; record, beating <em><a href="Gigi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gigi</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Last_Emperor" title="wikilink">The Last Emperor</a></em> (which each took 9 out of 9). <em>The Return of the King</em> also made movie history as the highest grossing film opening on a Wednesday and was the second film after <em><a href="Titanic_(1997_film)" title="wikilink">Titanic</a></em> to earn over US$1 billion worldwide. However, certain changes made in the adaptation offended some fans of the books. The overall reaction however is that is a worthy interpretation of the book, most changes stemming from putting the book into a modern context.</p>
<h3 id="dramatic-productions">Dramatic productions</h3>
<p>Three original full-length stage adaptations of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) were staged in <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. The first production unfortunately suffered from poor funding and no clear artistic vision from the producing company. The sequels, however, were well received by audiences and critics alike. All three adaptations were written by <a href="Blake_Bowden" title="wikilink">Blake Bowden</a>, scored with a full orchestra by <a href="Grammy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grammy</a> nominee Steve Goers and graphically produced by Jay Nungesser (inspired by Tolkien's original artwork). Aretta Baumgartner directed the puppetry work and was awarded a Cincinnati Entertainment Award for her portrayal of <a href="Gollum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gollum</a>. <a href="Blake_Bowden" title="wikilink">Bowden</a> portrayed <a href="Sam_Gamgee" title="wikilink">Sam</a> to Joe Sofranko, playing <a href="Frodo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Frodo</a>. The latter two productions were directed by actor, director, and <a href="fight_choreographer" title="wikilink">fight choreographer</a> Gina Cerimele-Mechley. The Return of the King was produced as the inaugural production of <a href="Clear_Stage_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Clear Stage Cincinnati</a>, and was presented at the <a href="Aronoff_Center" title="wikilink">Aronoff Center</a> for the Arts.

The show was written by Shaun McKenna and Matthew Warchus, with music by <a href="A._R._Rahman" title="wikilink">A. R.

<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>There are multiple real-world and <a href="video_games" title="wikilink">video games</a> that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>
<h4 id="real-world-games">Real-world games</h4>
<p>Several games have been based directly on <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and related works, including, amongst many, <a href="Iron_Crown_Enterprises" title="wikilink">Iron Crown Enterprises</a>' <a href="Middle-earth_Role_Playing" title="wikilink">Middle-earth Role Playing</a> game (1982-1999) and <a href="Middle-earth_Collectible_Card_Game" title="wikilink">Middle-earth Collectible Card Game</a> (1995-1999), as well as <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Trading_Card_Game" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game</a> (2001) made by <a href="Decipher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decipher</a>. All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="Games_Workshop" title="wikilink">Games Workshop</a> <a href="miniature_wargame" title="wikilink">miniature wargame</a> called <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Strategy_Battle_Game" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</a>, which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p>In 1955 and 1956, the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> broadcast <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1955_radio_series)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, a 12-part radio adaptation of the story. A 6-part version of <em>The Hobbit</em> was broadcast in 1966. In <cite>The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien</cite> Tolkien disparages the radio dramatization of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, referring to the portrayal of Tom Bombadil as &quot;Dreadful&quot; and complaining bitterly about several other aspects of the dramatization. No recording of the 1956 series is known to exist, but <em>The Hobbit</em> has survived. It is a very faithful adaptation, incorporating some passing references to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and the <em><a href="Silmarillion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silmarillion</a></em>.</p>
<p>A 1979 dramatization of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was broadcast in the USA and subsequently issued on tape and CD. No cast or credits appear on the audio packaging. Each of the actors was apparently recorded separately and then the various parts were edited together. Thus, unlike a BBC recording session where the actors are recorded together, none of the cast are actually interacting with each other and the performances suffer badly as a result.</p>
<p>In 1981 the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> broadcast <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1981_radio_series)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, a new, ambitious dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments.</p>
<p>In addition many songs in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> have also given inspiration to many musicians to set them to music. Most notable is the music of <a href="Donald_Swann" title="wikilink">Donald Swann</a> in <em><a href="The_Road_Goes_Ever_On" title="wikilink">The Road Goes Ever On</a></em>, because it was approved by Tolkien himself, and the music of <a href="The_Tolkien_Ensemble" title="wikilink">The Tolkien Ensemble</a>, because they, with backing from the <a href="Tolkien_Estate" title="wikilink">Tolkien Estate</a>, have set all the songs and poems from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to music.</p>
<h3 id="art">Art</h3>
<p>Many illustrators have rendered their vision of Middle-earth in various media, and some have used their Tolkien illustration as a stepping-stone to larger careers. Two of the most notable of these are <a href="John_Howe" title="wikilink">John Howe</a> and <a href="Alan_Lee" title="wikilink">Alan Lee</a>. Both began their career illustrating various editions of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Due to this Peter Jackson chose the two as lead artists for his movies based on the books. In 2004, as a result, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for his work on the third film in the trilogy, <em>The Return of the King</em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Both have since gone on to do conceptual design for various other films, including <em><a href="King_Kong" title="wikilink">King Kong</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Lion,_the_Witch,_and_the_Wardrobe" title="wikilink">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="Margrethe_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Queen Margrethe II of Denmark</a> is also an accomplished and critically-acclaimed painter, and has held many art shows over the years. It is often said that were she not the Queen, she could easily make a living as a professional artist. Her illustrations were used for the Danish edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> published in 1977 and the re-issue in 2002.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Other notable <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> artists include <a href="Jimmy_Cauty" title="wikilink">Jimmy Cauty</a>, <a href="Ted_Nasmith" title="wikilink">Ted Nasmith</a>, <a href="Tove_Jansson" title="wikilink">Tove Jansson</a>, <a href="Jenny_Dolfen" title="wikilink">Jenny Dolfen</a>, and <a href="The_Brothers_Hildebrandt" title="wikilink">The Brothers Hildebrandt</a>.</p>
<h2 id="influences-on-the-fantasy-genre">Influences on the fantasy genre</h2>
<p>The enormous popular success of Tolkien's epic saga greatly expanded the demand for <a href="fantasy_fiction" title="wikilink">fantasy fiction</a>. Largely thanks to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s. Many other books in a broadly similar vein were published (including the <em><a href="Earthsea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earthsea</a></em> books of <a href="Ursula_K._Le_Guin" title="wikilink">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, the <em><a href="Thomas_Covenant" title="wikilink">Thomas Covenant</a></em> <a href="novel" title="wikilink">novels</a> of <a href="Stephen_R._Donaldson" title="wikilink">Stephen R. Donaldson</a>), and in the case of the <em><a href="Gormenghast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gormenghast</a></em> books by <a href="Mervyn_Peake" title="wikilink">Mervyn Peake</a>, and <em><a href="The_Worm_Ouroboros" title="wikilink">The Worm Ouroboros</a></em> by <a href="E._R._Eddison" title="wikilink">E. R. Eddison</a>, rediscovered.</p>
<p>It also strongly influenced the <a href="role_playing_game" title="wikilink">role playing game</a> industry which achieved popularity in the 1970s with <em><a href="Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons" title="wikilink">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Dungeons &amp; Dragons features many races found in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> most notably the presence of halflings, elves, dwarves, half-elves, <a href="Orcs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orcs</a>, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, lead designer of the game, maintains that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings, stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the then-popularity of the work.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> also has influenced <a href="Magic:_The_Gathering" title="wikilink">Magic: The Gathering</a>. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has also influenced the creation of various videogames, including <a href="Baldur&#39;s_Gate" title="wikilink">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a href="Everquest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everquest</a>, <a href="The_Elder_Scrolls" title="wikilink">The Elder Scrolls</a>, <a href="Neverwinter_Nights" title="wikilink">Neverwinter Nights</a>, and the <a href="Warcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warcraft</a> series.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>As in all artistic fields, a great many lesser derivatives of the more prominent works appeared. The term &quot;Tolkienesque&quot; is used in the genre to refer to the oft-used and abused storyline of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: a group of adventurers embarking on a quest to save a magical fantasy world from the armies of an evil &quot;<a href="Dark_Lord" title="wikilink">dark lord</a>&quot;, and is a testament to how much the popularity of these books has increased, since many critics initially decried it as being &quot;<a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a> for children&quot; (a reference to the <a href="Ring_Cycle" title="wikilink">Ring Cycle</a>) — an especially interesting commentary in light of a possible interpretation of the books as a Christian response to Wagner.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pop-culture-references">Pop culture references</h2>

<p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a>, from its publication in the 1950s, but especially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, where young people embraced it as a <a href="counterculture" title="wikilink">countercultural</a> saga. Its influence has been vastly extended in the present day, thanks to the Peter Jackson live-action films. Well known examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are at least three compositions by the British rock band <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a> that contain explicit references to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: &quot;<a href="Ramble_On" title="wikilink">Ramble On</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="The_Battle_of_Evermore" title="wikilink">The Battle of Evermore</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Misty_Mountain_Hop" title="wikilink">Misty Mountain Hop</a>&quot;.</li>
