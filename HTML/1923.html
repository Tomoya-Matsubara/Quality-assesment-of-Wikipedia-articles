<p>In the 1990s, the <a href="Bosnian_Genocide" title="wikilink">Bosnian Genocide</a> and <a href="Kosovo_War" title="wikilink">Kosovo War</a>, both of which involved the &quot;mass murder of innocent Muslims,&quot; have been linked to Islamophobia.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In Bosnia, Christian <a href="Serb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serb</a> and <a href="Croat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croat</a> militias carried out genocidal attacks on the Muslim <a href="Bosniak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bosniak</a> community. According to the <a href="International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">ICRC</a> data on the Bosnian Genocide, &quot;200,000 people were killed, 12,000 of them children, up to 50,000 women were raped, and 2.2 million were forced to flee their homes.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many attacks on religious buildings and symbols took place in towns such as <a href="Fo&lt;U+010D&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fo&lt;U+010D&gt;a</a>, where all of the town's <a href="mosque" title="wikilink">mosques</a> were destroyed. On 22 April 1992, Serbs blew up the Alad&lt;U+017E&gt;a Mosque and eight more mosques dating from the 16th and 17th centuries were damaged or completely destroyed. On January 1994, the Serb authorities renamed Fo&lt;U+010D&gt;a &lt;U+201C&gt;Srbinje&lt;U+201D&gt; (), literally meaning &quot;place of the Serbs&quot; (from <em>Srbi</em> Serbs and <em>-nje</em> which is a Slavic locative suffix).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bulgaria">Bulgaria</h3>
<p>In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many under pressure as a result of the <a href="communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">communist</a> <a href="Todor_Zhivkov" title="wikilink">Zhivkov</a> regime's assimilation campaign (though up to a third returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt <a href="Bulgarian_name" title="wikilink">Bulgarian names</a> and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, some experts believe that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would be issued only in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity removed. <a href="Mosques" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mosques</a> were closed. According to estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned or sent to labor camps or were forcibly resettled.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="china">China</h3>

<p>Many Uyghurs face religious persecution and discrimination at the hands of the <a href="Government_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">government</a> authorities. Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can only use a state-approved version of the Koran;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> men who work in the state sector cannot wear beards and women cannot wear headscarves.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Chinese state controls the management of all mosques, which many Uyghurs claim stifles religious traditions that have formed a crucial part of the Uyghur identity for centuries.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend religious services at mosques.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatist, rather than Muslim. The government of China was willing to compromise with Hui (Chinese Muslim) activists when they staged public marches in Beijing and Lanzhou in 1989 to protest the publication of a book they deemed insulting to Islam, police protected the marchers and the government even agreed to the protestor's demands: the offensive book was banned and its authors were arrested. The Chinese government assisted them because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. During the mid-March riots in 2008, Muslim shopkeepers and their families were badly hurt and some were killed when fires set in their shops spread to upstairs apartments. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, many Muslims have stopped wearing the traditional white caps that identify their religion. Many women now wear a hairnet instead of a scarf. Since the nearest mosque was burned down in August, the Muslims pray at home in secret. The Tibetan exile community is reluctant to publicize incidents that might harm the international image of Tibetans. The Hui usually support the Chinese government's repression of Tibetan separatism.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Islamic_scarf_controversy_in_France" title="wikilink">Islamic headscarf ban</a> at schools in 2004 has been accused of being Islamophobic. As a consequence, the years following the ban has seen an increasing number of <a href="Madrasah" title="wikilink">Islamic secondary schools</a> being established, <a href="Islam_in_France" title="wikilink">French Muslim</a> female students increasingly choosing to study at home, some shaving their hair, and others migrating away from France with their families.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Muslim students have also increasingly enrolled at Catholic schools, which are usually more tolerant towards Islam than the secular public schools.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 2010, a study entitled, <em>Are French Muslims Discriminated Against in Their Own Country?</em>, has shown that &quot;Muslims sending out resumes in hopes of a job interview had 2.5 times less chance than Christians&quot; with similar credentials &quot;of a positive response to their applications.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="myanmar">Myanmar</h3>

<p>Muslims are stereotyped in the society as &quot;cattle killers&quot; (referring to the cattle sacrifice festival of Eid Al Adha in Islam). The generic <a href="racist" class="uri" title="wikilink">racist</a> slur of &quot;Kala&quot; (black) used against perceived &quot;foreigners&quot; has especially negative connotations when referring to Burmese Muslims. The more pious Muslim communities which segregate themselves from the Buddhist majority face greater difficulties than those Muslims who integrate more at the cost of not observing Islamic personal laws.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Muslims in Myanmar are affected by the actions of <a href="Islamic_Fundamentalists" title="wikilink">Islamic Fundamentalists</a> in other countries. Violence in <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> perpetrated by <a href="Islamists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islamists</a> is used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslim minorities in Burma. The anti-Buddhist actions of the <a href="Taliban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taliban</a> in Afghanistan (the destruction of the <a href="Buddhas_of_Bamiyan" title="wikilink">Buddhas of Bamiyan</a>) was also used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslims in Myanmar by Buddhist mobs. <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a> reports that there was mounting tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Taungoo for weeks before it erupted into violence in the middle of May 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in &quot;retaliation&quot; for the destruction of the <a href="Buddhas_of_Bamiyan" title="wikilink">Buddhas of Bamiyan</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Mobs of Buddhists, led by monks, vandalized Muslim owned businesses and property and attacked and killed Muslims in Muslim communities.

Human Rights Watch also alleges that Burmese military intelligence agents disguised as monks, led the mobs.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The dictatorial government, which operates a pervasive internal security apparatus, generally infiltrates or monitors the meetings and activities of virtually all organizations, including religious organizations.

Monitoring and control of Islam undermines the free exchange of thoughts and ideas associated with religious activities.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<li>On 16 August 2006 British passengers on board a flight from Malaga to Manchester requested the removal of two men of Asian descent from a plane. According to a spokesman for the <a href="Civil_Guard" title="wikilink">Civil Guard</a> in Malaga, &quot;These men had aroused suspicion because of their appearance and the fact that they were speaking in a foreign language thought to be an <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic language</a>, and the pilot was refusing to take off until they were escorted off the plane.&quot; A security sweep of the plane found no explosives or any item of a terrorist nature. <a href="Monarch_Airlines" title="wikilink">Monarch Airlines</a> booked the men, who were Urdu speakers, into a hotel room, gave them a free meal and sent them home on a later plane. The men later responded, &quot;Just because we're Muslim, does not mean we are suicide bombers.&quot; The Islamic Human Rights Commission blamed &quot;ever-increasing Islamophobia&quot; related to the &quot;war on terror&quot; for the incident.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></li>
<li>A passenger traveling to the <a href="British_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">British Virgin Islands</a> on a plane bound for the United States from Manchester in the UK was forced off the plane prior to takeoff. The man, a British-born Muslim residing in the United States, said he was singled out because he was a Muslim pilot and was left feeling &quot;demoralized and humiliated. I must have met the profile on the day.

Although the FBI subsequently cleared the passengers and called the incident a &quot;misunderstanding,&quot; AirTran refused to seat the passengers on another flight, forcing them to purchase last minute tickets on another airline that had been secured with the FBI's assistance. A spokesman for AirTran initially defended the airline's actions and said they would not reimburse the passengers for the cost of the new tickets. Although the men had traditional beards and the women <a href="headscarves" class="uri" title="wikilink">headscarves</a>, AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></li>
