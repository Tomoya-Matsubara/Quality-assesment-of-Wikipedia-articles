<p>The <strong>Kinzua Bridge</strong> or the <strong>Kinzua Viaduct</strong> ( or ) was a <a href="Rail_transport_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">railroad</a> <a href="trestle" class="uri" title="wikilink">trestle</a> that had spanned <a href="Kinzua_Creek" title="wikilink">Kinzua Creek</a> in <a href="McKean_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">McKean County</a> in the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>. The bridge was  tall and  long prior to its collapse.</p>
<p>The bridge was originally built from iron in 1882 and was billed as the &quot;<a href="Eighth_Wonder_of_the_World" title="wikilink">Eighth Wonder of the World</a>&quot;, holding the record as the tallest railroad bridge in the world for two years. In 1900 the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains. It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the <a href="Government_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">state government of Pennsylvania</a> in 1963, becoming the centerpiece of a state park. Restoration of the bridge began in 2002, but before it was finished, a tornado struck the bridge in 2003 causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse. Contributing to the collapse was the failure, caused by corrosion, of the anchor bolts holding the bridge towers to their foundations.</p>
<p>Before its collapse, the Kinzua Bridge was ranked as the fourth tallest railway bridge in the United States.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1977 and as a <a href="List_of_historic_civil_engineering_landmarks" title="wikilink">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> in 1982.

<p>In 1882, <a href="Thomas_L._Kane" title="wikilink">Thomas L.

The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional  of track over rough terrain.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure: the Portage Bridge over the <a href="Genesee_River" title="wikilink">Genesee River</a> in <a href="upstate_New_York" title="wikilink">upstate New York</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1893 the NYLE&amp;W went bankrupt and was merged with the <a href="Erie_Railroad" title="wikilink">Erie Railroad</a>, which became the owner of the bridge.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> By the start of the 20th century locomotives were almost 85 percent heavier, and the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24. Construction on the new steel bridge began on May 26, starting from both ends. Two <a href="Truss_bridge#Howe_truss" title="wikilink">Howe Truss</a> &quot;timber travelers&quot;, each  long and  deep, were used to build the new bridge.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Each traveler was supported by two of the original towers on the opposite sides of a third original tower that was to be demolished. After the middle tower had been removed, construction of a new steel replacement tower and the spans adjoining it took one week.

<p>Train crews would sometimes play a trick on a <a href="brakeman" class="uri" title="wikilink">brakeman</a> on his first journey on the line. When the train was a short distance from the bridge, the crew would send the brakeman over the rooftops of the cars to check on a small supposed problem. As the train crossed the bridge, the rookie &quot;suddenly found himself terrified, staring down three hundred feet [91 m] from the roof of a rocking boxcar&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even after being reconstructed the bridge still had a speed limit of . As the bridge aged, heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so the engines could cross the bridge one at a time.

<p>The Erie Railroad obtained <a href="Arrangements_between_railroads#Trackage_rights" title="wikilink">trackage rights</a> on the nearby <a href="Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad" title="wikilink">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (B&amp;O) line in the late 1950s, which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge. Regular commercial service ended on June 21, 1959, and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of <a href="Indiana,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Indiana, Pennsylvania</a>, for $76,000.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B&amp;O line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> According to the <a href="American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>, the Kinzua Bridge &quot;was a critical structure in facilitating the transport of coal from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region, and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="July_21_2003_Pennsylvania_mesocyclone.gif" title="fig:Radar loop of the storm over northern Pennsylvania" alt="Radar loop of the storm over northern Pennsylvania" /> On July 21, 2003, a <a href="tornado" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornado</a> struck the Kinzua Bridge, snapping and uprooting nearby trees, as well as causing 11 of the 20 bridge towers to collapse. The tornado was produced by a <a href="mesoscale_convective_system" title="wikilink">mesoscale convective system</a> (MCS), a complex of strong thunderstorms, that had formed over an area that included eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York, and southern <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The MCS traveled east at around . As the MCS crossed northwestern Pennsylvania, it formed into a distinctive <a href="comma" class="uri" title="wikilink">comma</a> shape (something that usually happens after the formation of a <a href="bow_echo" title="wikilink">bow echo</a>). The northern portion of the MCS contained a &quot;long–lived&quot; <a href="mesocyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">mesocyclone</a>, and while mesocyclones are not often associated with tornadic activity, they can sometimes produce tornadoes.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>At approximately 15:20 <a href="Eastern_Daylight_Time" title="wikilink">EDT</a> (20:20 <a href="Coordinated_Universal_Time" title="wikilink">UTC</a>), the tornado touched down in Kinzua Bridge State Park,  from the Kinzua Bridge. The tornado, classified as F1 on the <a href="Fujita_scale" title="wikilink">Fujita scale</a>, passed by the bridge and continued another  before it lifted. It touched down again  from <a href="Smethport,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Smethport</a> and traveled another  before finally dissipating.

<p>Since 2002, the Kinzua Bridge had been closed to all &quot;recreational <a href="pedestrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">pedestrian</a> and railroad usage&quot; after it was determined that the structure was at risk to high winds.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Engineers had determined that during high winds, the bridge's <a href="center_of_mass" title="wikilink">center of gravity</a> would shift, putting weight onto only one side of the bridge and causing it to <a href="structural_failure" title="wikilink">fail</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> An <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>-based bridge construction and repair company had already started work on restoring the Kinzua Bridge in February 2003.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In fact, the workers had already packed up and were starting to leave for the day when the storm came.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>When the tornado touched down, the winds had increased to at least  and were coming from the east, perpendicular to the bridge, which ran north-south. An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first, in a westerly direction.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge. Next towers 4 through 9 collapsed to the west, twisting clockwise, as the tornado started to move northward.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> As it moved north, inflow winds came in from the south and caused Towers 12, 13, and 14 to finally collapse towards the north, twisting counterclockwise.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The failures were caused by the badly rusted base bolts holding the bases of the towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into the ground.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> An investigation determined that the tornado had a wind speed of at least , which applied an estimated  of lateral force on to the bridge.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The investigation also hypothesized that the whole structure oscillated laterally 4 to 5 times before <a href="fatigue_(material)" title="wikilink">fatigue</a> started to cause the base bolts to fail. The towers fell intact in sections and suffered damage upon impact with the ground.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The tornado took less than 30 seconds to destroy the bridge which had stood for over a century.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
