<p><strong>Native Americans in the United States</strong> are the <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">indigenous peoples in North America</a> within the boundaries of the present-day <a href="continental_United_States" title="wikilink">continental</a> <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, parts of <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a>, and the island state of <a href="Hawaii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a>. They are composed of numerous, distinct <a href="Native_American_tribes" title="wikilink">Native American tribes</a> and <a href="ethnic_group" title="wikilink">ethnic groups</a>, many of which survive as intact political communities. The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been <a href="Native_American_name_controversy" title="wikilink">controversial</a>. According to a 1995 <a href="U.S.&amp;nbsp;Census_Bureau" title="wikilink">U.S.&amp;nbsp;Census Bureau</a> set of home interviews, most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as <strong>American Indians</strong> or <strong>Indians</strong>, and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups; however, this term does not include <a href="Native_Hawaiians" title="wikilink">Native Hawaiians</a> or those <a href="Alaskan_Natives" title="wikilink">Alaskan Natives</a>, such as <a href="Aleut_people" title="wikilink">Aleuts</a>, <a href="Alutiiq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alutiiq</a>, <a href="Cup&#39;ik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cup'ik</a>, <a href="Yupik_peoples" title="wikilink">Yup'ik</a>, and <a href="Inuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inuit</a> peoples, who are not American Indians.</p>
<p>Since the end of the 15th century, the <a href="Human_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> of Europeans to the Americas, and their importation of <a href="Africans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africans</a> as <a href="slaves" class="uri" title="wikilink">slaves</a>, has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between <a href="Old_World" title="wikilink">Old</a> and <a href="New_World" title="wikilink">New World</a> societies. Europeans created most of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the colonists' immigration to the Americas.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Many Native Americans lived as <a href="hunter-gatherer" class="uri" title="wikilink">hunter-gatherer</a> societies and told their histories by oral traditions. In many groups, women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple crops: maize, beans and squash. The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the <a href="agrarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">agrarian</a>, proto-industrial, mostly Christian <a href="immigrants" class="uri" title="wikilink">immigrants</a> from western <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a>. Many Native cultures were <a href="matrilineal" class="uri" title="wikilink">matrilineal</a>; the people occupied lands for use of the entire community, for hunting or agriculture. Europeans at that time had <a href="patriarchal" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriarchal</a> cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different.</p>
<p>The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations of each culture through the centuries, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence and social disruption. The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with <a href="infectious_disease" title="wikilink">infectious</a> Eurasian diseases, to which they had no acquired <a href="immunity_(medical)" title="wikilink">immunity</a>. <a href="Epidemics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epidemics</a> after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly, ranging from 1 million to 18 million.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After the colonies revolted against <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> and established the United States of America, President <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> and <a href="Henry_Knox" title="wikilink">Henry Knox</a> conceived of the idea of &quot;civilizing&quot; Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as U.S. citizens.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Assimilation (whether voluntary as with the <a href="Choctaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Choctaw</a>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> or forced) became a consistent policy through American administrations. During the 19th century, the ideology of <a href="manifest_destiny" title="wikilink">manifest destiny</a> became integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and rising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the <a href="Indian_Removal_Act" title="wikilink">Indian Removal Act</a>, authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>, accommodating European-American expansion.</p>
<p>The first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers. There were also <a href="Jesuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a> <a href="missionaries" class="uri" title="wikilink">missionaries</a> active in the Northern Tier. As United States expansion reached into the <a href="American_West" title="wikilink">American West</a>, settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the <a href="Great_Basin_tribes" title="wikilink">Great Basin</a>, <a href="Great_Plains_tribes" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a>, and other Western tribes. These were complex <a href="nomadic" class="uri" title="wikilink">nomadic</a> cultures based on <a href="horse_culture" title="wikilink">horse culture</a> and seasonal <a href="bison" class="uri" title="wikilink">bison</a> hunting. They carried out strong <a href="resistance_movement" title="wikilink">resistance</a> to United States incursions in the decades after the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, in a series of <a href="Indian_Wars" title="wikilink">Indian Wars</a>, which were frequent up until the 1890s, but continued into the 20th century. The transcontinental <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a> brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west. Over time, the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes, and established reservations for them in many western states. U.S. agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits, but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands. In 1924, Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were <a href="Indian_Citizenship_Act_of_1924" title="wikilink">granted citizenship</a> by <a href="Congress_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with sovereignty and <a href="treaty_rights" title="wikilink">treaty rights</a>. Since the late 1960s, Native American activism has led to the building of cultural infrastructure and wider recognition: they have founded independent newspapers and online media; FNX, the first Native American television channel (2011),<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> community schools, <a href="tribal_colleges_and_universities" title="wikilink">tribal colleges</a>, and tribal museums and language programs; <a href="Native_American_studies" title="wikilink">Native American studies</a> programs in major universities; and national and state museums. Native American and Alaskan Native authors have been increasingly published; they work as academics, policymakers, doctors, and in a wide variety of occupations. Cultural activism has led to an expansion of efforts to teach and preserve indigenous languages for younger generations. Their societies and cultures flourish within a larger population of descendants of immigrants (both voluntary and involuntary): <a href="African" class="uri" title="wikilink">African</a>, <a href="Asian_people" title="wikilink">Asian</a>, <a href="Middle_Eastern" title="wikilink">Middle Eastern</a>, <a href="European_ethnic_groups" title="wikilink">European</a>, and other peoples.</p>

<p>According to the most generally accepted theory of the <a href="settlement_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">settlement of the Americas</a>, migrations of humans from <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a> to the Americas took place via <a href="Beringia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beringia</a>, a <a href="land_bridge" title="wikilink">land bridge</a> which connected the two continents across what is now the <a href="Bering_Strait" title="wikilink">Bering Strait</a>.

<p>The <a href="Clovis_culture" title="wikilink">Clovis culture</a>, a <a href="megafauna" class="uri" title="wikilink">megafauna</a> hunting culture is primarily identified by use of fluted <a href="spear" class="uri" title="wikilink">spear</a> points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near <a href="Clovis,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Clovis, New Mexico</a>. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive <a href="Clovis_point" title="wikilink">Clovis point</a>, a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of <a href="carbon_dating" title="wikilink">carbon dating</a> methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years <a href="Before_Present" title="wikilink">B.P.</a> (roughly 9100 to 8850 BCE).</p>
<p>Numerous <a href="Paleoindian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleoindian</a> cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> and <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a> of the modern <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">United States of America</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional <a href="creation_stories" title="wikilink">creation stories</a>. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians.

<p>The <a href="Folsom_Tradition" title="wikilink">Folsom Tradition</a> was characterized by use of <a href="Folsom_point" title="wikilink">Folsom points</a> as projectile tips, and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of <a href="bison" class="uri" title="wikilink">bison</a> took place.

<p><a href="Na-Dene_languages" title="wikilink">Na-Den&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>-speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE, reaching the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a> by 5000 BCE,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and from there migrating along the <a href="Pacific_Coast" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast</a> and into the interior. Linguists, anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. They were the earliest ancestors of the <a href="Athabascan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athabascan</a>- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical <a href="Navajo_people" title="wikilink">Navajo</a> and <a href="Apache" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apache</a>. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The <a href="Oshara_Tradition" title="wikilink">Oshara Tradition</a> people lived from 5500 BCE to 600 CE.

<p>Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle <a href="Archaic_period_in_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Archaic</a> sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple <a href="earthworks_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">earthwork</a> <a href="mound" title="wikilink">mounds</a>; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of <a href="Neolithic_Revolution" title="wikilink">Neolithic Revolution</a> to sustain such large villages over long periods. The prime example is <a href="Watson_Brake" title="wikilink">Watson Brake</a> in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000 years older than the <a href="Poverty_Point" title="wikilink">Poverty Point</a> site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500 years until was abandoned about 2800 BCE, likely due to changing environmental conditions.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Poverty_Point_culture" title="wikilink">Poverty Point culture</a> is a Late Archaic <a href="archaeological_culture" title="wikilink">archaeological culture</a> that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200 BCE to 700 BCE, during the Late Archaic period.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, from the major complex at <a href="Poverty_Point,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Poverty Point, Louisiana</a> across a  range to the <a href="Jaketown_Site" title="wikilink">Jaketown Site</a> near <a href="Belzoni,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Belzoni, Mississippi</a>. Poverty Point is a  complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often described as <a href="mound_builder_(people)" title="wikilink">mound builders</a>.</p>

The <a href="Hopewell_tradition" title="wikilink">Hopewell tradition</a> is the term used to describe common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> from 200 BCE to 500 CE.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <img src="Nordamerikanische_Kulturareale_en.png" title="fig:Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America, according to Alfred Kroeber." alt="Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America, according to Alfred Kroeber." width="300" /> The Hopewell tradition was not a single <a href="culture" class="uri" title="wikilink">culture</a> or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> into the southeastern <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> shores of <a href="Lake_Ontario" title="wikilink">Lake Ontario</a>. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes.

There is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity, especially by the end of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of <a href="chiefdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">chiefdom</a> societies were not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple <a href="elite" class="uri" title="wikilink">elite</a> polities had begun.

<p>The <a href="Mississippian_culture" title="wikilink">Mississippian culture</a>, which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast, created the largest <a href="earthworks_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">earthworks</a> in North America north of Mexico, most notably at <a href="Cahokia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cahokia</a>, on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. Its ten-story <a href="Monks_Mound" title="wikilink">Monks Mound</a> has a larger circumference than the <a href="Pyramid_of_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Pyramid of the Sun</a> at <a href="Teotihuacan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teotihuacan</a> or the <a href="Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" title="wikilink">Great Pyramid</a> of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>. The  city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100 mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of <a href="astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, and built with knowledge of varying soil types. It included a <a href="Woodhenge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woodhenge</a>, whose sacred <a href="Thuja" title="wikilink">cedar</a> poles were placed to mark the summer and winter <a href="solstices" class="uri" title="wikilink">solstices</a> and fall and spring <a href="equinoxes" class="uri" title="wikilink">equinoxes</a>.

<p>Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them.

The <a href="Northwest_Indian_War" title="wikilink">Northwest Indian War</a> was led by Native American tribes trying to repulse American settlers. The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands. Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists, others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands. The state of New York made a separate treaty with Iroquois nations and put up for sale  of land that had previously been their territories. The state established small reservations in western New York for the remnant peoples.</p>

<p>In July 1845, the New York newspaper editor John L. O&lt;U+2019&gt;Sullivan coined the phrase, &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; as the &quot;design of Providence&quot; supporting the territorial expansion of the United States.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <a href="Manifest_Destiny" title="wikilink">Manifest Destiny</a> had serious consequences for Native Americans, since continental expansion for the United States took place at the cost of their occupied land. Manifest Destiny was a justification for expansion and westward movement, or, in some interpretations, an ideology or doctrine that helped to promote the process of civilization. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious and certain. The term was first used primarily by <a href="Jacksonian_democracy" title="wikilink">Jacksonian Democrats</a> in the 1840s to promote the annexation of much of what is now the <a href="Western_United_States" title="wikilink">Western United States</a> (the <a href="Oregon_Territory" title="wikilink">Oregon Territory</a>, the <a href="Texas_Annexation" title="wikilink">Texas Annexation</a>, and the <a href="Mexican_Cession" title="wikilink">Mexican Cession</a>).</p>

<p>The age of Manifest Destiny, which came to be associated with extinguishing American Indian territorial claims and removing them to reservations, gained ground as the United States population explored and settled west of the Mississippi River. Although Indian Removal from the Southeast had been proposed by some as a humanitarian measure to ensure their survival away from Americans, conflicts of the nineteenth century led some Americans to regard the natives as &quot;savages&quot;.</p>

<h4 id="removals-and-reservations">Removals and reservations</h4>


<p>In the 19th century, the incessant <a href="Manifest_Destiny" title="wikilink">westward expansion of the United States</a> incrementally compelled large numbers of Native Americans to resettle further west, often by force, almost always reluctantly. Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the <a href="Hopewell_Treaty" title="wikilink">Hopewell Treaty of 1785</a>. Under President <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a>, <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> passed the <a href="Indian_Removal_Act" title="wikilink">Indian Removal Act</a> of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a> for lands west of the river . As many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this <a href="Indian_Removal" title="wikilink">Indian Removal</a> policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties.</p>
<p>The most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the <a href="Treaty_of_New_Echota" title="wikilink">Treaty of New Echota</a>, which was signed by a dissident faction of <a href="Cherokee" title="wikilink">Cherokees</a> but not the principal chief. The following year, the Cherokee conceded to removal, but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European-American settlement before that. President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west, whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4,000 Cherokees on the <a href="Trail_of_Tears" title="wikilink">Trail of Tears</a>. About 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees, were taken by force migration to Indian Territory.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Tribes were generally located to reservations where they could more easily be separated from traditional life and pushed into European-American society. Some southern states additionally enacted laws in the 19th century forbidding non-Native American settlement on Native American lands, with the intention to prevent sympathetic white missionaries from aiding the scattered Native American resistance.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. &quot;The war&quot;, said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, &quot;caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era&quot;, affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity&lt;U+2014&gt;as a result of wartime labor shortages&lt;U+2014&gt;to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.</p>
<p>There were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 <a href="Pueblo_Indians" title="wikilink">Pueblo</a> men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition many more <a href="Navajo_people" title="wikilink">Navajo</a> served as code talkers for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although <a href="cryptology" title="wikilink">cryptologically</a> very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.</p>
<h4 id="self-determination">Self-determination</h4>

<p>Military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the <a href="occupation_of_Alcatraz_Island" title="wikilink">occupation of Alcatraz Island</a> (1969&lt;U+2013&gt;1971) by a student Indian group from <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>. In the same period, the <a href="American_Indian_Movement" title="wikilink">American Indian Movement</a> (AIM) was founded in <a href="Minneapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a>, and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.</p>
<p>Through the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the <a href="Wounded_Knee_incident" title="wikilink">Wounded Knee incident</a> on the <a href="Pine_Ridge_Indian_Reservation" title="wikilink">Pine Ridge Indian Reservation</a>. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 <a href="Oglala_Lakota" title="wikilink">Oglala Lakota</a> and <a href="American_Indian_Movement" title="wikilink">American Indian Movement</a> (AIM) activists took control of <a href="Wounded_Knee,_South_Dakota" title="wikilink">Wounded Knee</a> on February 27, 1973. Indian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one <a href="United_States_Marshal" title="wikilink">United States Marshal</a> was wounded and paralyzed. In late April a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> In June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist <a href="Leonard_Peltier" title="wikilink">Leonard Peltier</a> was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1975 the U.S. Congress passed the <a href="Indian_Self-Determination_and_Education_Assistance_Act" title="wikilink">Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act</a>, marking the culmination of 15 years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President <a href="Lyndon_Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon Johnson</a>'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance.</p>
<p>By this time, tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA boarding schools. Led by the <a href="Navajo_Nation" title="wikilink">Navajo Nation</a> in 1968, tribes started <a href="tribal_colleges_and_universities" title="wikilink">tribal colleges and universities</a>, to build their own models of education on reservations, preserve and revive their cultures, and develop educated workforces. In 1994 the U.S. Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as <a href="land-grant_colleges" title="wikilink">land-grant colleges</a>, which provided opportunities for funding. Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the <a href="American_Indian_Higher_Education_Consortium" title="wikilink">American Indian Higher Education Consortium</a>. By the early 21st century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.</p>
<p>In addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish <a href="Native_American_studies" title="wikilink">Native American studies</a> programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians. In 1981, <a href="Tim_Giago" title="wikilink">Tim Giago</a> founded the <em><a href="Lakota_Times" title="wikilink">Lakota Times</a></em>, an independent Native American newspaper, located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government. He later founded the <a href="Native_American_Journalists_Association" title="wikilink">Native American Journalists Association</a>. Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed, so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events.</p>
<p>In 2004 Senator <a href="Sam_Brownback" title="wikilink">Sam Brownback</a> (<a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> of <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a>) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 37) to &quot;offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States&quot; for past &quot;ill-conceived policies&quot; by the U.S. government regarding Indian Tribes.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> signed the historic apology into law in 2009, as section Section 8113 of the 2010 defense appropriations bill.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> </p>
<p>After years of investigation and independent work by Native American journalists, in 2003 the U.S. government indicted suspects in the December 1975 murder of <a href="Anna_Mae_Aquash" title="wikilink">Anna Mae Aquash</a> at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A ''Mi'qmaq',' Aquash was the highest-ranking woman activist in the <a href="American_Indian_Movement" title="wikilink">American Indian Movement</a> (AIM) at the time. She was killed several months after two <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> agents had been killed at the reservation. Many Lakota believe that she was killed by AIM on suspicion of having been an FBI informant, but she never worked for the FBI.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Arlo Looking Cloud was convicted in federal court in 2004.

<h2 id="international-indigenous-rights">International indigenous rights</h2>
<p>Activists around the world have been working on organizing for indigenous rights. On September 13, 2007 the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">General Assembly</a> adopted the <a href="Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples" title="wikilink">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, after nearly 25 years of discussion. Indigenous representatives from the United States, particularly from AIM, played a key role in the development of this Declaration, as did indigenous peoples from the Americas and other nations. It was passed with an overwhelming majority of 143 votes in favor; only Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States voted against it. Each of these four nations has indigenous populations that became outnumbered, disfranchised and historically oppressed by new immigrant groups.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> They expressed serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly. Australia and New Zealand have since then changed their vote in favor of the Declaration.</p>
<p>The U.S. mission issued a floor document, &quot;Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&quot;, setting out its objections to the Declaration. The United States drew attention to the Declaration's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term &quot;indigenous peoples&quot; is intended to cover.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> A change in political administrations has resulted in U.S. support for the document. In December 2010, President Obama declared that the United States would sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="current-legal-status">Current legal status</h2>

<p>There are 562 <a href="List_of_Native_American_Tribal_Entities" title="wikilink">federally recognized tribal governments</a> in the United States. These tribes possess the right to form their own governments, to enforce laws (both civil and criminal) within their lands, to tax, to establish requirements for membership, to license and regulate activities, to zone and to exclude persons from tribal territories. Limitations on tribal powers of self-government include the same limitations applicable to states; for example, neither tribes nor states have the power to make war, engage in foreign relations, or coin money (this includes paper currency).<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights point out that the U.S. federal government's claim to recognize the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of Native American peoples falls short, given that the United States wishes to govern Native American peoples and treat them as subject to U.S. law. Such advocates contend that full respect for Native American sovereignty would require the U.S. government to deal with Native American peoples in the same manner as any other sovereign nation, handling matters related to relations with Native Americans through the Secretary of State, rather than the <a href="Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs" title="wikilink">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a>. The Bureau of Indian Affairs reports on its website that its &quot;responsibility is the administration and management of  of land held in trust by the United States for American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights believe that it is condescending for such lands to be considered &quot;held in trust&quot; and regulated in any fashion by other than their own tribes, whether the U.S. or Canadian governments, or any other non-Native American authority.</p>
<p>As of year 2000, the largest tribes in the United States by population were <a href="Navajo_Nation" title="wikilink">Navajo</a>, <a href="Cherokee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherokee</a>, <a href="Choctaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Sioux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sioux</a>, <a href="Chippewa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chippewa</a>, <a href="Apache" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apache</a>, <a href="Blackfeet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blackfeet</a>, <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a>, and <a href="Puebloan_peoples" title="wikilink">Pueblo</a>. In 2000, eight of ten Americans with Native American ancestry were of mixed ancestry. It is estimated that by 2100 that figure will rise to nine out of ten.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> In addition, there are a number of tribes that are <a href="List_of_State_Recognized_American_Indian_Tribal_Entities" title="wikilink">recognized by individual states</a>, but not by the federal government. The rights and benefits associated with state recognition vary from state to state.</p>
<p>Some tribal nations have been unable to document the cultural continuity required for federal recognition. The <a href="Ohlone" title="wikilink">Muwekma Ohlone</a> of the San Francisco bay area are pursuing litigation in the federal court system to establish recognition.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Many of the smaller eastern tribes, long considered remnants of extinct peoples, have been trying to gain official recognition of their tribal status. Several in Virginia and North Carolina have gained state recognition. Federal recognition confers some benefits, including the right to label arts and crafts as Native American and permission to apply for grants that are specifically reserved for Native Americans. But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult; to be established as a tribal group, members have to submit extensive <a href="genealogy" title="wikilink">genealogical</a> proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture.</p>

<p>In July 2000 the <a href="Washington_Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Washington Republican Party</a> adopted a resolution recommending that the federal and legislative branches of the <a href="U.S.&amp;nbsp;government" class="uri" title="wikilink">U.S.&amp;nbsp;government</a> terminate tribal governments.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In 2007 a group of <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> congressmen and congresswomen introduced a bill in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. House of Representatives</a> to &quot;terminate&quot; the <a href="Cherokee_Nation" title="wikilink">Cherokee Nation</a>.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> This was related to their voting to exclude Cherokee Freedmen as members of the tribe unless they had a Cherokee ancestor on the Dawes Rolls, although all Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants had been members since 1866.</p>
<p>As of 2004, various Native Americans are wary of attempts by others to gain control of their reservation lands for natural resources, such as <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a> and <a href="uranium" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium</a> in the West.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>In the state of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, Native Americans face a unique problem. Virginia has no federally recognized tribes but the state has recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.</p>
<p>Some historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of <a href="Walter_Ashby_Plecker" title="wikilink">Walter Ashby Plecker</a> (1912&lt;U+2013&gt;1946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the <a href="one-drop_rule" title="wikilink">one-drop rule</a>, enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot;.</p>
<p>Plecker, a <a href="Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">segregationist</a>, believed that the state's Native Americans had been &quot;mongrelized&quot; by intermarriage with <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African Americans</a>; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to &quot;<a href="passing_(racial_identity)" title="wikilink">pass</a>&quot; as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as &quot;colored&quot;, and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;colored&quot;. He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In 2009, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>To achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900. The federal government has maintained this requirement, in part because through participation on councils and committees, federally recognized tribes have been adamant about groups' satisfying the same requirements as they did.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

<p>In the early 21st century, Native American communities have exhibited continuing growth and revival, playing a larger role in the American economy, and in the lives of Native Americans. Communities have consistently formed governments that administer services such as <a href="firefighting" class="uri" title="wikilink">firefighting</a>, <a href="natural_resource" title="wikilink">natural resource</a> management, social programs, housing and <a href="Law_enforcement_agency" title="wikilink">law enforcement</a>.

To address the housing needs of Native Americans, Congress passed the <em>Native American Housing and Self Determination Act</em> (NAHASDA) in 1996. This legislation replaced public housing built by the BIA, and other 1937 Housing Act programs directed towards Indian Housing Authorities, with a block-grant program providing funds to be administered by the Tribes to develop their own housing.</p>

During the period when White and de Bry were working, when Europeans were first coming into contact with Native Americans, Europeans were greatly interested in native American cultures. Their curiosity created demand for a book like de Bry&lt;U+2019&gt;s.</p>
<p>A number of 19th and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were <a href="Elbridge_Ayer_Burbank" title="wikilink">Elbridge Ayer Burbank</a>, <a href="George_Catlin" title="wikilink">George Catlin</a>, <a href="Seth_and_Mary_Eastman" title="wikilink">Seth Eastman</a>, <a href="Paul_Kane" title="wikilink">Paul Kane</a>, <a href="W._Langdon_Kihn" title="wikilink">W. Langdon Kihn</a>, <a href="Charles_Bird_King" title="wikilink">Charles Bird King</a>, <a href="Joseph_Henry_Sharp" title="wikilink">Joseph Henry Sharp</a>, and <a href="John_Mix_Stanley" title="wikilink">John Mix Stanley</a>.</p>
<p>During the construction of the <a href="United_States_Capitol" title="wikilink">Capitol building</a> in the early 19th century, the <a href="U.S._government" title="wikilink">U.S. government</a> commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the <a href="United_States_Capitol_rotunda" title="wikilink">Rotunda</a>. The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European&lt;U+2014&gt;Native American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th century. The four panels depict: <em>The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas</em> (1825) by <a href="Antonio_Capellano" title="wikilink">Antonio Capellano</a>, <em>The Landing of the Pilgrims</em> (1825) and <em>The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians</em> (1826&lt;U+2013&gt;27) by <a href="Enrico_Causici" title="wikilink">Enrico Causici</a>, and <em>William Penn&lt;U+2019&gt;s Treaty with the Indians</em> (1827) by <a href="Nicholas_Gevelot" title="wikilink">Nicholas Gevelot</a>. The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans, in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious. The <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig</a> representative of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, <a href="Henry_A._Wise" title="wikilink">Henry A. Wise</a>, wrote about how Native Americans might think of the reliefs: &quot;We give you corn, you cheat us of our lands: we save your life, you take ours.&quot; While many 19th-century images of Native Americans conveyed similarly negative messages, artists such as <a href="Charles_Bird_King" title="wikilink">Charles Bird King</a> sought to express a more balanced image of Native Americans.</p>
<p>During this time, some fiction writers were informed about and sympathetic to Native American culture. <a href="Marah_Ellis_Ryan" title="wikilink">Marah Ellis Ryan</a> conveyed the culture with sympathy.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in <a href="movies" class="uri" title="wikilink">movies</a> and <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em> (1920), <em>Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans</em> (1957), and <em><a href="F_Troop" title="wikilink">F Troop</a></em> (1965&lt;U+2013&gt;67). In later decades, Native American actors such as <a href="Jay_Silverheels" title="wikilink">Jay Silverheels</a> in <em><a href="The_Lone_Ranger#Television_series" title="wikilink">The Lone Ranger</a></em> television series (1949&lt;U+2013&gt;57) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in <em><a href="Little_Big_Man_(film)" title="wikilink">Little Big Man</a></em> (1970), <em><a href="Billy_Jack" title="wikilink">Billy Jack</a></em> (1971), and <em><a href="The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales" title="wikilink">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a></em> (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.</p>
<p>For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series <em><a href="Bonanza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonanza</a></em> (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series <em><a href="The_Lone_Ranger" title="wikilink">The Lone Ranger</a></em> (1949&lt;U+2013&gt;1957), <em><a href="Cheyenne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheyenne</a></em> (1957&lt;U+2013&gt;1963), and <em><a href="Law_of_the_Plainsman" title="wikilink">Law of the Plainsman</a></em> (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as <em><a href="How_the_West_Was_Won_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">How the West Was Won</a></em>. These programs resembled the &quot;sympathetic&quot; yet contradictory film <em><a href="Dances_With_Wolves" title="wikilink">Dances With Wolves</a></em> of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Like the 1992 remake of <em><a href="The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_(1992_film)" title="wikilink">The Last of the Mohicans</a></em> and <em><a href="Geronimo:_An_American_Legend" title="wikilink">Geronimo: An American Legend</a></em> (1993), <em>Dances with Wolves</em> employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.</p>
<p>In 2004 producer Guy Perrotta presented the film <em><a href="Mystic_Voices:_The_Story_of_the_Pequot_War" title="wikilink">Mystic Voices: The Story of the Pequot War</a></em> (2004), a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas. Perrotta and Charles Clemmons intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event. They believed it had significance not only for northeastern Native Peoples and descendants of English and Dutch colonists, but for all Americans today. Wanting to make the film historically accurate and unbiased, the producers invited a broadly based Advisory Board, and used scholars, Native Americans, and descendants of the colonists to help tell the story. They elicited personal and often passionate viewpoints from contemporary Americans. The production portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems, which included not only the Pequot, but a number of other Native American tribes, most of which allied with the English. It presents facts and seeks to help viewers better understand the several peoples who fought the War.</p>
<p>In 2009 <em><a href="We_Shall_Remain_(documentary)" title="wikilink">We Shall Remain</a></em> (2009), a television documentary by <a href="Ric_Burns" title="wikilink">Ric Burns</a> and part of the <a href="American_Experience" title="wikilink">American Experience</a> series, presented a five-episode series &quot;from a Native American perspective&quot;. It represented &quot;an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project.&quot;<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The five episodes explore the impact of <a href="King_Philip&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">King Philip's War</a> on the northeastern tribes, the &quot;Native American confederacy&quot; of <a href="Tecumseh&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">Tecumseh's War</a>, the US-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the <a href="Trail_of_Tears" title="wikilink">Trail of Tears</a>, the pursuit and capture of <a href="Geronimo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geronimo</a> and the <a href="Apache_Wars" title="wikilink">Apache Wars</a>, and concludes with the <a href="Wounded_Knee_incident" title="wikilink">Wounded Knee incident</a>, participation by the <a href="American_Indian_Movement" title="wikilink">American Indian Movement</a>, and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.</p>

Today, people from India (and their descendants) who are citizens of the United States are called <em><a href="Indian_American" title="wikilink">Indian Americans</a></em> or <em>Asian Indians</em>.</p>
<p>Criticism of the <a href="neologism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neologism</a> <em>Native American</em> comes from diverse sources. <a href="Russell_Means" title="wikilink">Russell Means</a>, an American Indian activist, opposes the term <em>Native American</em> because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians.

The compound &quot;Native American&quot; is generally <a href="capitalization" title="wikilink">capitalized</a> to differentiate the reference to the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>A 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred <em>American Indian</em> to <em>Native American</em>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Most American Indians are comfortable with <em>Indian</em>, <em>American Indian</em>, and <em>Native American</em>, and the terms are often used interchangeably.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the <a href="National_Museum_of_the_American_Indian" title="wikilink">National Museum of the American Indian</a>, which opened in 2004 on the Mall in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>.</p>

<p>Though cultural features, language, clothing, and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another, there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes. ''''' Early <a href="hunter-gatherer" class="uri" title="wikilink">hunter-gatherer</a> tribes made stone weapons from around 10,000 years ago; as the age of <a href="metallurgy" class="uri" title="wikilink">metallurgy</a> dawned, newer technologies were used and more efficient weapons produced. Prior to contact with Europeans, most tribes used similar weaponry. The most common implements were the bow and arrow, the war club, and the spear. Quality, material, and design varied widely. <a href="Native_American_use_of_fire" title="wikilink">Native American use of fire</a> both helped provide and prepare for <a href="food" class="uri" title="wikilink">food</a> and <a href="Pre-Columbian_savannas_of_North_America" title="wikilink">altered the landscape of the continent</a> to help the human population flourish.</p>
<p>Large mammals like <a href="mammoth" title="wikilink">mammoths</a> and <a href="mastodon" title="wikilink">mastodons</a> were largely extinct by around 8000 BCE. Native Americans switched to hunting other large game, such as <a href="American_Bison" title="wikilink">bison</a>. The Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the natives' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. (Evidence of pre-historic horses prior to the arrival of the Spanish has been found in the <a href="La_Brea_Tar_Pits" title="wikilink">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a>.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a>) In addition, horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth.</p>

<p>Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by <a href="clans" class="uri" title="wikilink">clans</a> or <a href="gens" title="wikilink">gentes</a> (in the Roman model) before tribes were formed. There were some common characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to elect its <a href="sachem" class="uri" title="wikilink">sachem</a> and chiefs.</li>
<li>The right to depose its sachem and chiefs.</li>
<li>The obligation not to marry in the gens.</li>
<li>Mutual rights of inheritance of the property of deceased members.</li>
<li>Reciprocal obligations of help, defense, and redress of injuries.</li>
<li>The right to bestow names on its members.</li>
<li>The right to adopt strangers into the gens.</li>
<li>Common religious rights, query.</li>
<li>A common burial place.</li>
<li>A council of the gens.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tribal-structure">Tribal structure</h4>
<p>Subdivision and differentiation took place between various groups. Upwards of forty stock languages developed in North America, with each independent tribe speaking a dialect of one of those languages. Some functions and attributes of tribes are: <img src="Shonto_begay.jpg" title="fig:Shonto Begay, Navajo painter from Arizona" alt="Shonto Begay, Navajo painter from Arizona" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The possession of the gentes.</li>
<li>The right to depose these sachems and chiefs.</li>
<li>The possession of a religious faith and worship.</li>
<li>A supreme government consisting of a council of chiefs.</li>
<li>A head-chief of the tribe in some instances.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></li>

<p>The <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a>, living around the <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a> and extending east and north, used strings or belts called <em><a href="wampum" class="uri" title="wikilink">wampum</a></em> that served a dual function: the knots and beaded designs mnemonically chronicled tribal stories and legends, and further served as a medium of exchange and a unit of measure. The keepers of the articles were seen as tribal dignitaries.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Pueblo_peoples" title="wikilink">Pueblo peoples</a> crafted impressive items associated with their religious ceremonies. <em><a href="Kachina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kachina</a></em> dancers wore elaborately painted and decorated masks as they ritually impersonated various ancestral spirits. Sculpture was not highly developed, but carved stone and wood fetishes were made for religious use. Superior weaving, embroidered decorations, and rich dyes characterized the textile arts. Both turquoise and shell jewelry were created, as were high-quality pottery and formalized pictorial arts.</p>
<p><a href="Navajo_people" title="wikilink">Navajo</a> spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world, often achieved by ceremonial acts, usually incorporating <a href="sandpainting" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandpainting</a>. The colors&lt;U+2014&gt;made from sand, charcoal, cornmeal, and pollen&lt;U+2014&gt;depicted specific spirits. These vivid, intricate, and colorful sand creations were erased at the end of the ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h3>

<p><img src="Zea_mays.jpg" title="fig:Maize grown by Native Americans" alt="Maize grown by Native Americans" /> <img src="1940_govt_photo_minnesota_farming_scene_chippewa_baby_teething_on_magazine_indians_at_work.jpg" title="fig:Chippewa baby waits on a cradleboard while parents tend rice crops (Minnesota, 1940)." alt="Chippewa baby waits on a cradleboard while parents tend rice crops (Minnesota, 1940)." /></p>
<p>An early crop the Native Americans grew was <a href="squash_(plant)" title="wikilink">squash</a>. Others early crops included <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a>, <a href="sunflower" class="uri" title="wikilink">sunflower</a>, <a href="pumpkins" class="uri" title="wikilink">pumpkins</a>, <a href="tobacco" class="uri" title="wikilink">tobacco</a>, <a href="goosefoot" class="uri" title="wikilink">goosefoot</a>, <a href="knotgrass" class="uri" title="wikilink">knotgrass</a>, and <a href="sump_weed" title="wikilink">sump weed</a>.</p>
<p>Agriculture in the southwest started around 4,000 years ago when traders brought cultigens from Mexico. Due to the varying climate, some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful. The climate in the southwest ranged from cool, moist mountains regions, to dry, sandy soil in the desert. Some innovations of the time included <a href="irrigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrigation</a> to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them. In the southwest, they grew beans that were self-supported, much like the way they are grown today.</p>
<p>In the east, however, they were planted right by corn in order for the vines to be able to &quot;climb&quot; the cornstalks. The most important crop the Native Americans raised was <a href="maize" class="uri" title="wikilink">maize</a>. It was first started in <a href="Mesoamerica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesoamerica</a> and spread north. About 2,000 years ago it reached eastern America. This crop was important to the Native Americans because it was part of their everyday diet; it could be stored in underground pits during the winter, and no part of it was wasted. The husk was made into art crafts, and the cob was used as fuel for fires. By 800 CE the Native Americans had established three main crops &lt;U+2014&gt; beans, squash, and corn &lt;U+2014&gt; called the <a href="Three_Sisters_(agriculture)" title="wikilink">three sisters</a>.</p>
<p>The agriculture gender roles of the Native Americans varied from region to region. In the southwest area, men prepared the soil with <a href="Hoe_(tool)" title="wikilink">hoes</a>. The women were in charge of planting, weeding, and harvesting the crops. In most other regions, the women were in charge of doing everything, including clearing the land. Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields frequently. There is a tradition that <a href="Squanto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Squanto</a> showed the Pilgrims in New England how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer, but the truth of this story is debated. Native Americans did plant beans next to corn; the beans would replace the <a href="nitrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> which the corn took from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing. Native Americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields; this would put nutrients back into the ground. If this did not work, they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow, and find a new spot for cultivation.</p>
<p>Europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that Natives cleared large areas for cropland. Their fields in New England sometimes covered hundreds of acres. Colonists in Virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>Native Americans commonly used tools such as the <a href="Hoe_(tool)" title="wikilink">hoe</a>, <a href="Sledgehammer" title="wikilink">maul</a>, and <a href="dibber" class="uri" title="wikilink">dibber</a>. The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting; then it was used for weeding. The first versions were made out of wood and stone. When the settlers brought iron, Native Americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets. The dibber was a digging stick, used to plant the seed. Once the plants were harvested, women prepared the produce for eating. They used the maul to grind the corn into mash. It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>

<p>Traditional Native American ceremonies are still practiced by many tribes and bands, and the older theological belief systems are still held by many of the &quot;traditional&quot; people. These <a href="spirituality" title="wikilink">spiritualities</a> may accompany adherence to another faith, or can represent a person's primary religious identity. While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself, certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among &quot;traditional&quot; Native American practitioners, these being identifiable as &quot;religions&quot; in the clinical sense. Traditional practices of some tribes include the use of sacred herbs such as tobacco, <a href="Hierochloe_odorata" title="wikilink">sweetgrass</a> or <a href="Leucophyllum" title="wikilink">sage</a>. Many Plains tribes have <a href="sweatlodge" class="uri" title="wikilink">sweatlodge</a> ceremonies, though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes. Fasting, singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people, and sometimes <a href="Native_American_music" title="wikilink">drumming</a> are also common.</p>
<p>The <a href="Midewin" title="wikilink">Midewiwin Lodge</a> is a traditional medicine society inspired by the oral traditions and prophesies of the <a href="Ojibwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ojibwa</a> (Chippewa) and related tribes.</p>
<p>Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the <a href="Native_American_Church" title="wikilink">Native American Church</a>. It is a <a href="Syncretism" title="wikilink">syncretistic</a> church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>. Its main rite is the <a href="peyote" class="uri" title="wikilink">peyote</a> ceremony. Prior to 1890, traditional religious beliefs included <a href="Wakan_Tanka" title="wikilink">Wakan Tanka</a>. In the American Southwest, especially <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, a syncretism between the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a> brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common; the religious drums, chants, and dances of the <a href="Pueblo_people" title="wikilink">Pueblo people</a> are regularly part of <a href="Mass_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">Masses</a> at <a href="Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Santa Fe</a>'s <a href="Saint_Francis_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Saint Francis Cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Native American-Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States.

<p>The <a href="eagle_feather_law" title="wikilink">eagle feather law</a> (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain <a href="eagle" class="uri" title="wikilink">eagle</a> feathers for <a href="religious" class="uri" title="wikilink">religious</a> or spiritual use.

<p>Gender roles were differentiated in most Native American tribes, and both had power in decisionmaking within the tribe. Many tribes, such as the <a href="Haudenosaunee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haudenosaunee</a> Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes, had <a href="Matrilineality" title="wikilink">matrilineal</a> systems, in which property and hereditary leadership were controlled by and passed through the maternal lines. The children were considered to belong to the mother's clan and achieved status within it. When the tribe adopted war captives, the children became part of their mother's clan and accepted in the tribe. In Cherokee and other matrilineal cultures, wives owned the family property. When young women married, their husbands joined them in their mother's household. This enabled the young women to have assistance for childbirth and rearing; it also protected her in case of conflicts between the couple. If they separated or the man was killed at war, the woman had her family to assist her. In addition, in matrilineal culture, the mother's brother was the leading male figure in a male child's life, as he mentored the child within the mother's clan.</p>
<p>The husband had no standing in his wife's and children's clan, as he belonged to his own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions passed through the mother's line, not the father's. Chiefs were selected on recommendation of women elders, who also could disapprove of a chief. There were sometimes hereditary roles for men called peace chiefs, but war chiefs were selected based on proven prowess in battle. Men usually had the roles of hunting, waging war, and negotiating with other tribes, including the Europeans after their arrival.</p>
<p>Others were <a href="patriarchy" title="wikilink">patriarchal</a>, although several <a href="Kinship_and_descent" title="wikilink">different systems</a> were in use. In the <a href="patrilineal" class="uri" title="wikilink">patrilineal</a> tribes, such as the <a href="Omaha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Omaha</a>, <a href="Osage_Nation" title="wikilink">Osage</a> and <a href="Ponca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ponca</a>, hereditary leadership passed through the male line, and children were considered to belong to the father and his <a href="clan" class="uri" title="wikilink">clan</a>. For this reason, when Europeans or American men took wives from such tribes, their children were considered &quot;white&quot; like their fathers, or &quot;<a href="mixed_race" title="wikilink">half-breeds</a>&quot;. Generally such children could have no official place in the tribe because their fathers did not belong to it, unless they were adopted by a male and made part of his family.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Men hunted, traded and made war. The women had primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe); they gathered and cultivated plants, used plants and herbs to treat illnesses, cared for the young and the elderly, made all the clothing and instruments, and processed and cured meat and skins from the game. They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags, saddle cloths, and tepee covers. Mothers used <a href="cradleboard" title="wikilink">cradleboards</a> to carry an infant while working or traveling.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>

Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of maize with hoes and digging sticks, while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops. On the Plains, some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs. Dwellers of the Southwest deserts hunted small animals and gathered acorns to grind into flour with which they baked wafer-thin bread on top of heated stones. Some groups on the region's mesas developed irrigation techniques, and filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area's frequent <a href="droughts" class="uri" title="wikilink">droughts</a>.</p>
<p>In the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.</p>

The estimated 2.1 million Native Americans are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups. According to the <a href="2000_United_States_Census" title="wikilink">2000 Census</a>, an estimated 400,000 Native Americans reside on reservation land.

<p>The barriers to <a href="economic_development" title="wikilink">economic development</a> on Native American reservations have been identified by <a href="Joseph_Kalt" title="wikilink">Joseph Kalt</a><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> and <a href="Stephen_Cornell" title="wikilink">Stephen Cornell</a><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> of the <a href="Harvard_Project_on_American_Indian_Economic_Development" title="wikilink">Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development</a> at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>, in their report: <em>What Can Tribes Do? Strategies and Institutions in American Indian Economic Development</em> (2008),<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> are summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of access to capital.</li>
<li>Lack of human capital (education, skills, technical expertise) and the means to develop it.</li>
<li>Reservations lack effective planning.</li>
<li>Reservations are poor in natural resources.</li>
<li>Reservations have natural resources, but lack sufficient control over them.</li>
<li>Reservations are disadvantaged by their distance from markets and the high costs of transportation.<embed src="(Teacher_with_picture_cards_giving_English_instruction_to_Navajo_day_school_students.)_-_NARA_-_295158.tif" title="fig:Teacher with picture cards giving English instruction to Navajo day school students" /></li>
<li>Tribes cannot persuade investors to locate on reservations because of intense competition from non-Native American communities.</li>
<li>The <a href="Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs" title="wikilink">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> is inept, corrupt, and/or uninterested in reservation development.</li>
<li>Tribal politicians and bureaucrats are inept or corrupt.</li>
<li>On-reservation factionalism destroys stability in tribal decisions.</li>
<li>The instability of tribal government keeps outsiders from investing. (Many tribes adopted constitutions by the 1934 <a href="Indian_Reorganization_Act" title="wikilink">Indian Reorganization Act</a> model, with two-year terms for elected positions of chief and council members deemed too short by the authors for getting things done)</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial skills and experience are scarce.</li>
<li>Tribal cultures get in the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>A major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within <a href="Indian_reservations" title="wikilink">Indian reservations</a>. &quot;A general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs,&quot; was the report on Native American <a href="entrepreneurship" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneurship</a> by the <a href="Northwest_Area_Foundation" title="wikilink">Northwest Area Foundation</a> in 2004. &quot;Native American communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive. Consequently, experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curricula and after-school and other community activities. This would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life.&quot;.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> <em><a href="Rez_Biz" title="wikilink">Rez Biz</a></em> magazine addresses these issues.</p>

<p>There was fear on both sides, as the different peoples realized how different their societies were.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The whites regarded the Indians as &quot;savage&quot; because they were not Christian.

<p>Blackbird wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;The Ottawas and Chippewas were quite virtuous in their primitive state, as there were no illegitimate children reported in our old traditions. But very lately this evil came to exist among the Ottawas-so lately that the second case among the Ottawas of 'Arbor Croche' is yet living in 1897.

<p>The U.

<p>For a Native American man to marry a white woman, he had to get consent of her parents, as long as &quot;he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home&quot;.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> In the early 19th century, the <a href="Shawnee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shawnee</a> Tecumseh and blonde hair &amp; blued eyed Rebbecca Galloway had a inter-racial affair.

<h4 id="european-enslavement">European enslavement</h4>
<p>When Europeans arrived as <a href="colonists" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonists</a> in North America, Native Americans changed their practice of <a href="slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavery</a> dramatically. Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the <a href="West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indies</a> grew with the cultivation of <a href="sugar_cane" title="wikilink">sugar cane</a>, Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the <a href="Thirteen_Colonies" title="wikilink">Thirteen Colonies</a>, and some were exported to the &quot;sugar islands.&quot; The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo. Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist. Scholars estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved by the Europeans, being sold by Native Americans themselves.</p>
<p>Slavery became a caste of people who were foreign to the English (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians. The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705: </p>
<p>The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730. It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the <a href="Yamasee_War" title="wikilink">Yamasee War</a>. The <a href="Indian_Wars" title="wikilink">Indian Wars</a> of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the <a href="Choctaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Choctaw</a>, the <a href="Muscogee_(Creek)" title="wikilink">Creek</a>, and the <a href="Catawba_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Catawba</a> for protection.</p>
<p>Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were disproportionately male. They turned to Native women for sexual relationships.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> Both Native American and African enslaved women suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other white men.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="native-american-slavery">Native American slavery</h4>

<h4 id="traditions-of-native-american-slavery">Traditions of Native American slavery</h4>
<p>The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America, but none exploited slave labor on a large scale. In addition, Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
<p>The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease. Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; but, this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>Among some <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a> tribes, about a quarter of the population were slaves.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Other slave-owning tribes of North America were, for example, <a href="Comanche" class="uri" title="wikilink">Comanche</a> of Texas, <a href="Creek_people" title="wikilink">Creek</a> of Georgia, the <a href="Pawnee_people" title="wikilink">Pawnee</a>, and <a href="Klamath_people" title="wikilink">Klamath</a>.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>

<p>African and Native Americans have interacted for centuries. The earliest record of Native American and African contact occurred in April 1502, when Spanish colonists transported the first Africans to <a href="Hispaniola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispaniola</a> to serve as slaves.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> <img src="Buffalo_soldiers1.jpg" title="fig:Buffalo Soldiers, 1890.

<p>In addition, in 1758 the governor of South Carolina James Glen wrote:</p>
<blockquote>

They worked together, lived together in communal quarters, produced collective recipes for food, shared herbal remedies, myths and legends, and in the end they intermarried.&quot;<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Because of a shortage of men due to warfare, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 18th century, many Native American women married freed or <a href="runaway_slave" title="wikilink">runaway</a> African men due to a decrease in the population of men in Native American villages.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Records show that many Native American women bought African men but, unknown to the European sellers, the women freed and married the men into their tribe.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> When African men married or had children by a Native American woman, their children were born free, because the mother was free (according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrum, which the colonists incorporated into law.)<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a></p>
<p>European colonists often required the return of <a href="runaway_slaves" title="wikilink">runaway slaves</a> to be included as a provision in treaties with American Indians. In 1726, the British Governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined up with them.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> In the mid 1760s, the government requested the <a href="Huron_tribe" title="wikilink">Huron</a> and <a href="Delaware_tribe" title="wikilink">Delaware</a> to return runaway slaves, but there was no record of slaves having been returned.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Colonists placed ads about runaway slaves.</p>
<p>While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves, they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died. In the Southeast, a few Native American tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the American colonists, buying African American slaves, especially the <a href="Cherokee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherokee</a>, <a href="Choctaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Choctaw</a>, and <a href="Muscogee_(Creek)" title="wikilink">Creek</a>. Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, divisions grew among the Native Americans over slavery.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> Among the Cherokee, records show that slave holders in the tribe were largely the children of European men that had shown their children the economics of slavery.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> As European colonists took slaves into frontier areas, there were more opportunities for relationships between African and Native American peoples.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<p>Based on the work of <a href="geneticists" class="uri" title="wikilink">geneticists</a>, a <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">PBS</a> series on African Americans explained that while most African Americans are racially mixed, it is relatively rare that they have Native American ancestry.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a><a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> According to the PBS series, the most common &quot;non-black&quot; mix is English and Scots-Irish.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> However, the Y-chromosome and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) testing processes for direct-line male and female ancestors can fail to pick up the heritage of many ancestors.

<h5 id="native-american-adoption-of-african-slavery">Native American adoption of African slavery</h5>
<p>Native Americans interacted with enslaved Africans and African Americans on many levels. Over time all the cultures interacted. Native Americans began slowly to adopt white culture.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Native Americans in the South shared some experiences with Africans, especially during the period, primarily in the 17th century, when both were enslaved. The colonists along the Atlantic Coast had begun enslaving Native Americans to ensure a source of labor. At one time the slave trade was so extensive that it caused increasing tensions with the various <a href="Algonquian_peoples" title="wikilink">Algonquian</a> tribes, as well as the <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a>. Based in New York and Pennsylvania, they had threatened to attack colonists on behalf of the related <a href="Iroquoian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquoian</a> <a href="Tuscarora_people" title="wikilink">Tuscarora</a> before they migrated out of the South in the early 1700s.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1790s, <a href="Benjamin_Hawkins" title="wikilink">Benjamin Hawkins</a> was assigned as the US agent to the southeastern tribes, who became known as the Five Civilized Tribes for their adoption of numerous Anglo-European practices. He advised the tribes to take up slaveholding to aid them in European-style farming and plantations. He thought their traditional form of slavery, which had looser conditions, was less efficient than <a href="chattel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chattel</a> slavery.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> In the nineteenth century, some members of these tribes who were more closely associated with settlers, began to purchase African-American slaves for workers. They adopted some European-American ways to benefit their people.</p>
<p>The writer William Loren Katz contends that Native Americans treated their slaves better than did the typical European American in the <a href="Deep_South" title="wikilink">Deep South</a>.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, bondage created destructive cleavages among those who were slaveholders.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="Five_Civilized_Tribes" title="wikilink">Five Civilized Tribes</a>, mixed-race slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy, often based on their mothers' clan status, as the societies had <a href="matrilineal" class="uri" title="wikilink">matrilineal</a> systems. As did Benjamin Hawkins, European fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry high-status women, in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides. The Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances with the traders and their societies. The women's sons gained their status from their mother's families; they were part of hereditary leadership lines who exercised power and accumulated personal wealth in their changing Native American societies. The historian Greg O'Brien calls them the Creole generation to show that they were part of a changing society. The chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixed-race, bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by European Americans.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> Proposals for <a href="Indian_Removal" title="wikilink">Indian Removal</a> heightened the tensions of cultural changes, due to the increase in the number of <a href="mixed-race" class="uri" title="wikilink">mixed-race</a> Native Americans in the South. Full bloods, who tended to live in areas less affected by colonial encroachment, generally worked to maintain traditional ways, including control of communal lands. While the traditional members often resented the sale of tribal lands to Anglo-Americans, by the 1830s they agreed it was not possible to go to war with the colonists on this issue.</p>

These captives were from rival tribes and later from European settlements. Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves, and others owned slaves of their own. Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture, reflecting years of intermarriage between European men and Native American women.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans existed.</p>
<p>In recent years, genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African-American population. The literary and history scholar <a href="Henry_Louis_Gates,_Jr." title="wikilink">Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</a> had experts on his TV programs about African-American ancestry. They stated that 5% of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry. A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of admixture may have been too high.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a></p>
<p>DNA testing is not sufficient to qualify a person for specific tribal membership as it cannot distinguish among Native American groups.</p>
<p>Native American identity has historically been based on culture, not just biology, as many American Indian peoples adopted captives from their enemies and assimilated them into their tribes. The Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Native American markers&quot; are not found solely among Native Americans. While they occur more frequently among Native Americans, they are also found in people in other parts of the world.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geneticists state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all Native Americans have been tested; especially with the large number of deaths due to disease such as small pox, it is unlikely that Native Americans only have the genetic markers they have identified, even when their maternal or paternal bloodline does not include a non-Native American.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a><a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="tribal-classifications">Tribal Classifications</h4>
<p>To receive tribal services, a Native American must belong to, and be certified by, a recognized tribal organization. Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members. The federal government has standards related to services available to certified Native Americans. For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe and have at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a <a href="Certificate_of_Degree_of_Indian_Blood" title="wikilink">Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood</a> (CDIB) card. Among tribes, qualification may be based upon a required percentage of Native American &quot;blood&quot; (or the &quot;<a href="Blood_quantum_laws" title="wikilink">blood quantum</a>&quot;) of an individual seeking recognition, or documented descent from an ancestor on the <a href="Dawes_Rolls" title="wikilink">Dawes Rolls</a> or other registers.</p>
<p>Some tribes have begun requiring <a href="genealogical_DNA_test" title="wikilink">genealogical DNA testing</a>, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 <a href="Dawes_Rolls" title="wikilink">Dawes Rolls</a>. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.</p>
<p>Tribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the <a href="Cherokee_Freedmen" title="wikilink">Cherokee Freedmen</a>. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the <a href="Cherokee_Nation_(19th_century)" title="wikilink">historic Cherokee Nation</a> as freedmen after the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>. The <a href="Cherokee_Nation" title="wikilink">modern Cherokee Nation</a>, in the early 1980s, excluded them from citizenship, unless individuals can prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls.</p>
<h4 id="increased-self-identification">Increased self-identification</h4>
<p>Since the census of 2000, people who have, or believe they have, Native American ancestry may designate themselves, for census purposes, as being of more than one race.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> Since the 1960s the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to &quot;ethnic shifting&quot; or &quot;ethnic shopping&quot; and reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities that they are more compatible with. Author <a href="Jack_Hitt" title="wikilink">Jack Hitt</a> writes:</p>

<p>Journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that wanting to belong to the Native American culture may be a result of increased interest in genealogy, the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of believing that somewhere there were Native American ancestors. Problems is classification are compounded by different qualifications for tribal membership by different tribes, a fear of registering with a tribe because it is seen as a method of control initiated by the federal government, and the problem of individuals who are of 100% Native American background who, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:</p>

<h3 id="population">Population</h3>
<p>The 2010 census permitted respondents to self-identify as being of one or more races. Self-identification dates from the census of 1960; prior to that the race of the respondent was determined by opinion of the census taker. The option to select more than one race was introduced in 2000.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> If American Indian or Alaska Native was selected the form requested the name of the &quot;enrolled or principal tribe&quot;. The 2010 Census showed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2010, was 308.7 million. Out of the total U.S. population, 2.9 million people, or 0.9 percent, reported American Indian and Alaska Native alone. In addition, 2.3 million people, or another 0.7 percent, reported American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 5.2 million people. Thus, 1.7 percent of all people in the United States identified as American Indian and Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with one or more other races.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
<p>The definition of American Indian or Alaska Native used in the 2010 census:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Office of Management and Budget, &lt;U+201C&gt;American Indian or Alaska Native&lt;U+201D&gt; refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>78% of Native Americans live outside a reservation. Full blood individuals are more likely to live on a reservation than mixed blood individuals. The Navajo, with 286,000 full blood individuals, is the largest tribe if only full-blood individuals are counted; the Navajo are the tribe with the highest proportion of full blood individuals, 86.3%. The Cherokee, the largest tribe with 819,000 individuals, has only 284,000 full blood individuals.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
