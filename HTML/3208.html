<p>In the 1930s, Holden Chapel (and <a href="Hollis_Hall" title="wikilink">Hollis Hall</a>) were chosen by the Historical American Buildings Survey Commission as two of the finest examples of early <a href="American_colonial_architecture" title="wikilink">Colonial architecture</a> in Massachusetts<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>For much of the 20th century, Holden Chapel housed the student offices of the <a href="Harvard_Glee_Club" title="wikilink">Harvard Glee Club</a> and later the <a href="Radcliffe_Choral_Society" title="wikilink">Radcliffe Choral Society</a> and the <a href="Harvard-Radcliffe_Collegium_Musicum" title="wikilink">Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum</a>, which collectively came to be known as the <a href="Holden_Choirs" title="wikilink">Holden Choirs</a>. The chapel was remodeled in 1999 to serve as both a classroom and a musical rehearsal and performance space.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though no longer housing the Holden Choirs' offices, Holden Chapel now serves as their primary rehearsal space.</p>
