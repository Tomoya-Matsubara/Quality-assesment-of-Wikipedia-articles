<p>The <strong>Republican Party</strong> is one of the <a href="Two-party_system" title="wikilink">two</a> <a href="Major_party" title="wikilink">major</a> contemporary <a href="political_parties_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">political parties in the United States</a>, along with the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>. Founded by anti-slavery expansion activists in 1854, it is often called the <strong>Grand Old Party</strong> (<strong>GOP</strong>). The <a href="Party_platform" title="wikilink">party's platform</a> generally reflects <a href="Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American conservatism</a> in the <a href="Politics_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. political spectrum</a> and is considered <a href="centre-right" title="wikilink">center-right</a>, in contrast to the more <a href="Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">liberal-leaning</a> Democrats.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has the <a href="Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states" title="wikilink">second most registered voters</a> as of 2004 with 55 million, encompassing roughly one-third of the electorate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the <a href="112th_Congress" title="wikilink">112th Congress</a>, elected in <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2010" title="wikilink">2010</a>, the Republican Party holds a majority of seats in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>, and a minority of seats in the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a>.

<p><img src="Republicanlogo.svg" title="fig:The traditional elephant logo is a well-known symbol of the Republican Party." alt="The traditional elephant logo is a well-known symbol of the Republican Party." /> Founded in northern states in 1854 by <a href="Slave_Power" title="wikilink">anti-slavery</a> activists, modernizers, <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">ex-Whigs</a> and ex-<a href="Free_Soil" title="wikilink">Free Soilers</a>, the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant <a href="History_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>. It first came to power in 1860 with the election of <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a> to the Presidency and Republicans in control of Congress and the northern states. It oversaw the saving of the union, the destruction of slavery, and the provision of equal rights to all men in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>, 1861-1877.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854 in <a href="Jackson,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Jackson, Michigan</a>. The Republicans' initial base was in the <a href="Northeastern_United_States" title="wikilink">Northeast</a> and the upper <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwest</a>. With the <a href="Realigning_election" title="wikilink">realignment</a> of parties and voters in the <a href="Third_Party_System" title="wikilink">Third Party System</a>, the strong run of <a href="John_C._Fremont" title="wikilink">John C. Fremont</a> in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1856" title="wikilink">1856 Presidential election</a> demonstrated it dominated most northern states. Early Republican ideology was reflected in the 1856 slogan &quot;free labor, free land, free men.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Free labor&quot; referred to the Republican opposition to slave labor and belief in independent artisans and businessmen. &quot;Free land&quot; referred to Republican opposition to plantation system whereby the rich could buy up all the good farm land and work it with slaves, leaving the <a href="yeoman" class="uri" title="wikilink">yeoman</a> independent farmers the leftovers. The Party had the goal of containing the expansion of slavery, which would cause the collapse of the <a href="Slave_Power" title="wikilink">Slave Power</a> and the expansion of freedom.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Lincoln, representing the fast-growing western states, won the Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency. The party took on the mission of saving the Union and destroying slavery during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> and over <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>. In the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1864" title="wikilink">election of 1864</a>, it united with pro-war Democrats to nominate Lincoln on the <a href="National_Union_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Union Party</a> ticket.  The party's success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s. Those who felt that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was continued mostly to promote the large-scale corruption tolerated by President <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a> ran <a href="Horace_Greeley" title="wikilink">Horace Greeley</a> for the presidency. The Stalwarts defended Grant and the <a href="spoils_system" title="wikilink">spoils system</a>; the <a href="Half-Breed_(politics)" title="wikilink">Half-Breeds</a> pushed for reform of the <a href="civil_service" title="wikilink">civil service</a>. The GOP supported business generally, hard money (i.e., the <a href="gold_standard" title="wikilink">gold standard</a>), <a href="Tariffs_in_American_history" title="wikilink">high tariffs to promote economic growth, high wages and high profits</a>, generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after 1893) the annexation of <a href="Hawaii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a>. The Republicans supported the pietistic Protestants who demanded <a href="Prohibition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prohibition</a>. As the Northern post-bellum economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth. Nevertheless, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the <a href="Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="wikilink">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and the <a href="Interstate_Commerce_Commission" title="wikilink">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high <a href="McKinley_Tariff" title="wikilink">McKinley Tariff</a> of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.</p>

<p>After the two terms of Democrat <a href="Grover_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Grover Cleveland</a>, the election of <a href="William_McKinley" title="wikilink">William McKinley</a> in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1896" title="wikilink">1896</a> is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a <a href="realigning_election" title="wikilink">realigning election</a>. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the <a href="Panic_of_1893" title="wikilink">Panic of 1893</a>, and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit. The Republicans were cemented as the party of business, though mitigated by the succession of <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a> who embraced <a href="trust_busting" title="wikilink">trust busting</a>. He later ran on a third party ticket of the <a href="Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)" title="wikilink">Progressive Party</a> and challenged his previous successor <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a>. The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s, running on a platform of opposition to the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>, high tariffs, and promotion of business interests. <a href="Warren_G._Harding" title="wikilink">Warren G. Harding</a>, <a href="Calvin_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Calvin Coolidge</a> and <a href="Herbert_Hoover" title="wikilink">Herbert Hoover</a> were resoundingly elected in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1920" title="wikilink">1920</a>, <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1924" title="wikilink">1924</a>, and <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1928" title="wikilink">1928</a> respectively. The <a href="Teapot_Dome_scandal" title="wikilink">Teapot Dome scandal</a> threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him, as the opposition splintered in 1924. The pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity until the <a href="Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="wikilink">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a> heralded the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="New_Deal_coalition" title="wikilink">New Deal coalition</a> of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African Americans</a> moved into the Democratic Party during Roosevelt's time. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress at lightning speed. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives was split in a similar ratio. Republicans in Congress heavily criticized the &quot;Second New Deal&quot; and likened it to <a href="class_conflict" title="wikilink">class warfare</a> and <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>. The volume of legislation, and the inability of the Republicans to block it, soon elevated the level of opposition to Roosevelt. Conservative Democrats, mostly from the South, joined with Republicans led by Senator <a href="Robert_Taft" title="wikilink">Robert Taft</a> to create the <a href="conservative_coalition" title="wikilink">conservative coalition</a>, which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964. The Republicans recaptured Congress in 1946 after gaining 13 seats in the Senate and 55 seats in the House.</p>

W. Bush</a> and <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a>. The Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip <a href="Newt_Gingrich" title="wikilink">Newt Gingrich</a> campaigning on a <em><a href="Contract_with_America" title="wikilink">Contract with America</a></em>, was elected to majorities to both houses of Congress in the <a href="Republican_Revolution" title="wikilink">Republican Revolution</a> of 1994. The Senate majority lasted until 2001, when the Senate became split evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections. Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control in the mid-term elections of 2006. In the 21st century, the Republican Party has been defined by <a href="social_conservatism" title="wikilink">social conservatism</a>, a <a href="preemptive_war" title="wikilink">preemptive war</a> foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy, a more powerful <a href="Executive_(government)" title="wikilink">executive branch</a>, <a href="supply-side_economics" title="wikilink">supply-side economics</a>, support for gun ownership, and deregulation.</p>
<p>In the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">Presidential election of 2008</a>, the party's nominees were Senator <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a>, of Arizona, for President and Alaska Governor <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a> for Vice President. They were defeated by Senator <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> of Illinois. In 2009, Republicans <a href="Chris_Christie" title="wikilink">Chris Christie</a> and <a href="Bob_McDonnell" title="wikilink">Bob McDonnell</a> were elected to the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia and in 2010, Republican <a href="Scott_Brown" title="wikilink">Scott Brown</a> won the Massachusetts special Senate election. Their victories were harbingers of a GOP landslide in fall 2010, retaking control of the House and gaining a majority of state governor seats. Overall 2010 was a historic election for the Republican party. The Republicans gained 680 seats, the biggest gain by either party since 1966, which surpassed Democratic gains in the election of 1974. Republicans now hold approximately 3,890 of the total state legislative seats in America, about 53 percent. That is the most seats in the GOP column since 1928. The Republicans will now control at least 54 of the 99 state legislative chambers, the highest number since 1952.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="NastRepublicanElephant.jpg" title="fig:1874 Nast cartoon featuring the first notable appearance of the Republican elephant." alt="1874 Nast cartoon featuring the first notable appearance of the Republican elephant." width="250" /> The party's founding members chose the name &quot;Republican Party&quot; in the mid-1850s as homage to the values of <a href="Republicanism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">republicanism</a> promoted by <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s Republican party.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party's leading publicist <a href="Horace_Greeley" title="wikilink">Horace Greeley</a>, who called for, &quot;some simple name like 'Republican' [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The name reflects the 1776 <a href="Republicanism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">republican</a> values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The term &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party, and the initialism &quot;G.O.P.&quot; (or &quot;GOP&quot;) is a commonly used designation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant. A political cartoon by <a href="Thomas_Nast" title="wikilink">Thomas Nast</a>, published in <em><a href="Harper&#39;s_Magazine" title="wikilink">Harper's Weekly</a></em> on November 7, 1874, is considered the first important use of the symbol.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the early 20th century, the usual symbol of the Republican Party in Midwestern states such as <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> and <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> was the <a href="eagle" class="uri" title="wikilink">eagle</a>, as opposed to the Democratic <a href="rooster" class="uri" title="wikilink">rooster</a>.

<p>After the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2000" title="wikilink">2000 election</a>, the color red became associated with the GOP, although the party has not officially adopted it. That election night, for the first time, all of the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a> were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, they have come to be widely recognized by the media to represent the respective political parties <em>(see <a href="Political_color" title="wikilink">Political color</a> and <a href="Red_states_and_blue_states" title="wikilink">Red states and blue states</a> for more details)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="structure-and-composition">Structure and composition</h2>

<p>The <a href="Republican_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC) is responsible for promoting Republican campaign activities. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. Its current chairman is the first African American elected to the post, <a href="Michael_S._Steele" title="wikilink">Michael S. Steele</a>. The chairman of the RNC is chosen by the President when the Republicans have the White House or otherwise by the Party's state committees. The RNC, under the direction of the party's presidential candidate, supervises the <a href="Republican_National_Convention" title="wikilink">Republican National Convention</a>, raises funds, and coordinates campaign strategy. On the local level, there are similar state committees in every state and most large cities, counties and legislative districts, but they have far less money and influence than the national body.</p>
<p>The Republican House and Senate caucuses have separate <a href="fundraising" class="uri" title="wikilink">fundraising</a> and strategy committees. The <a href="National_Republican_Congressional_Committee" title="wikilink">National Republican Congressional Committee</a> (NRCC) assists in House races, and the <a href="National_Republican_Senatorial_Committee" title="wikilink">National Republican Senatorial Committee</a> (NRSC) in Senate races. They each raise over $100 million per election cycle, and play important roles in recruiting strong state candidates, while the <a href="Republican_Governors_Association" title="wikilink">Republican Governors Association</a> (RGA) assists in state gubernatorial races; it is currently chaired by Governor <a href="Haley_Barbour" title="wikilink">Haley Barbour</a> of Mississippi.</p>
<h2 id="ideology-and-political-positions">Ideology and political positions</h2>

<p>The Republican Party includes <a href="Fiscal_conservatism" title="wikilink">fiscal conservatives</a>, <a href="Social_conservatism" title="wikilink">social conservatives</a>, <a href="Neoconservatism" title="wikilink">neoconservatives</a>, <a href="moderate" title="wikilink">moderates</a>, and <a href="Libertarianism" title="wikilink">libertarians</a>. Prior to the formation of the <a href="conservative_coalition" title="wikilink">conservative coalition</a>, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the party historically advocated <a href="classical_liberalism" title="wikilink">classical liberalism</a>, <a href="paleoconservatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">paleoconservatism</a>, and <a href="American_progressivism" title="wikilink">progressivism</a>.</p>
<h3 id="economic-policies">Economic policies</h3>
<p>Republicans emphasize the role of <a href="free_market" title="wikilink">free markets</a> and individual achievement as the primary factors behind economic prosperity. To this end, they favor <a href="laissez-faire" title="wikilink">laissez-faire economics</a>, <a href="fiscal_conservatism" title="wikilink">fiscal conservatism</a>, and the promotion of <a href="Responsibility_assumption" title="wikilink">personal responsibility over welfare programs</a>.</p>
<p>A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is <a href="supply-side_economics" title="wikilink">supply-side economics</a>. Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as <a href="Reaganomics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reaganomics</a>, a term popularized during the Presidential administrations of <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>. This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase <a href="GDP" class="uri" title="wikilink">GDP</a> growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth. This belief is reflected, in part, by the party's long-term advocacy of tax cuts. Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending. Republicans oppose the <a href="estate_tax" title="wikilink">estate tax</a>.</p>
<p>Most Republicans agree there should be a &quot;safety net&quot; to assist the less fortunate; however, they tend to believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is; as a result, Republicans support giving government grants to faith-based and other private charitable organizations to supplant welfare spending. Members of the GOP also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure the safety net is not abused. Republicans introduced and strongly supported the <a href="Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act" title="wikilink">welfare reform of 1996</a>, which was signed into law by Democratic President Clinton, and which limited eligibility for welfare, successfully leading to many former welfare recipients finding jobs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The party opposes a government-run <a href="single-payer_health_care" title="wikilink">single-payer health care</a> system, believing such a system constitutes <a href="socialized_medicine" title="wikilink">socialized medicine</a> and is in favor of a personal or employer-based system of insurance, supplemented by <a href="Medicare_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Medicare</a> for the elderly and <a href="Medicaid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medicaid</a>, which covers approximately 40% of the poor.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The GOP has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular <a href="Social_Security_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Social Security</a>, <a href="Medicare_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Medicare</a> and <a href="Medicaid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medicaid</a> programs. Congressional Republicans and the Bush administration supported a reduction in Medicaid's growth rate;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> however, congressional Republicans expanded Medicare, supporting a new drug plan for seniors starting in 2006. Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined <a href="electronic_medical_records" title="wikilink">electronic medical records</a> system, an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Republicans are generally opposed by <a href="trade_union" title="wikilink">labor union</a> management and members, and have supported various legislation on the state and federal levels, including <a href="right_to_work" title="wikilink">right to work</a> legislation and the <a href="Taft-Hartley_Act" title="wikilink">Taft-Hartley Act</a>, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions, as opposed to a <a href="closed_shop" title="wikilink">closed shop</a>, which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces. Some Republicans are opposed to increases in the <a href="minimum_wage" title="wikilink">minimum wage</a>, believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services, export jobs overseas, and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit.</p>

<p>Many contemporary Republicans voice support of <a href="strict_constructionism" title="wikilink">strict constructionism</a>, the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible &quot;living Constitution&quot; model.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Most Republicans point to <a href="Roe_v._Wade" title="wikilink">Roe v.

Other Republicans, though, argue that it is the right of judges to extend the interpretation of the Constitution and judge actions by the legislative or executive branches as legal or <a href="Constitutionality" title="wikilink">unconstitutional</a> on previously unarticulated grounds. The issue of <a href="judicial_deference" title="wikilink">judicial deference</a> to the legislature is a matter of some debate &lt;U+2014&gt; like the Democrats, most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own (conservative) legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation. Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases, in an attempt to limit judicial review. These <a href="jurisdiction_stripping" title="wikilink">jurisdiction stripping</a> laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same-sex marriage with the <a href="Marriage_Protection_Act_of_2007" title="wikilink">Marriage Protection Act</a>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the <a href="Pledge_Protection_Act" title="wikilink">Pledge Protection Act</a>, and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the <a href="Detainee_Treatment_Act" title="wikilink">Detainee Treatment Act</a>. The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in <em><a href="Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld" title="wikilink">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a></em>.</p>
<p>Compared with Democrats, many Republicans believe in a more robust version of <a href="federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalism</a> with greater limitations placed upon <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal</a> power and a larger role reserved for the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">States</a>. Following this view on <a href="federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalism</a>, Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the <a href="Commerce_Clause" title="wikilink">Commerce Clause</a>, such as in the opinion of <a href="William_Rehnquist" title="wikilink">William Rehnquist</a> in <em><a href="United_States_v._Lopez" title="wikilink">United States v. Lopez</a></em>. Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of <a href="Commerce_Clause" title="wikilink">Commerce Clause</a> power by revisiting, among other cases, <em><a href="Wickard_v._Filburn" title="wikilink">Wickard v.

<p>Some Republicans are skeptical of anthropogenic <a href="global_warming" title="wikilink">global warming</a> and question scientific studies on the impact of human activity on climate change. Instead, they assert that global warming is part of a natural cyclical phenomenon, or is caused by a number of other alternative factors. The Republican Party has supported the protection of the environment. Republican President <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern U.S. <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> President <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> was responsible for establishing the <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">Environmental Protection Agency</a> in 1970.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> More recently, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> Republican Governor <a href="Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="wikilink">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, with the support of 16 other states, <a href="filing_(legal)" title="wikilink">sued</a> the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Federal Government</a> and the <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> for the right to set vehicle emission standards higher than the <a href="US_emission_standard" title="wikilink">Federal Standard</a>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> a right to which California is entitled under the <a href="Clean_Air_Act" title="wikilink">Clean Air Act</a>.</p>
<p>This association however has shifted as the Democratic Party came to also support environmentalism. President <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> has publicly opposed ratification of the <a href="Kyoto_Protocol" title="wikilink">Kyoto Protocols</a> on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while giving developing Global South polluters such as <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> and <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> a pass. Democratic President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> also never sent the Kyoto treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification as he also thought it unfair to the United States.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market-based solutions to environmental problems. According to the platform, &quot;economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together, environmental regulations should be based on science, the government&lt;U+2019&gt;s role should be to provide market-based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

McCain supports the <a href="Emissions_trading" title="wikilink">cap-and-trade</a> policy, a policy that is quite popular among Democrats but much less so among other Republicans. Most Republicans support increased <a href="oil_well" title="wikilink">oil drilling</a> in currently protected areas such as the <a href="Arctic_National_Wildlife_Refuge" title="wikilink">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>, a position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists.</p>
<h3 id="social-policies">Social policies</h3>
<p>The 2004 Republican platform expressed support for the <a href="Federal_Marriage_Amendment" title="wikilink">Federal Marriage Amendment</a> to the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a> to define marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman. A majority of the GOP's national and state candidates are <a href="pro-life" class="uri" title="wikilink">pro-life</a> and oppose elective <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a> on religious or moral grounds, and favor <a href="White_House_Office_of_Faith-Based_and_Community_Initiatives" title="wikilink">faith-based initiatives</a>. There are some exceptions, though, especially in the <a href="Northeastern_United_States" title="wikilink">Northeast</a> and Pacific Coast states. They are generally against <a href="affirmative_action" title="wikilink">affirmative action</a> for women and some minorities often describing it as a <a href="racial_quota" title="wikilink">quota system</a>, believing that it is not <a href="meritocratic" class="uri" title="wikilink">meritocratic</a> and that is counter-productive socially by only further promoting <a href="discrimination" class="uri" title="wikilink">discrimination</a>. Many Republicans support race-neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Most of the GOP's membership favors <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">capital punishment</a> and stricter punishments as a means to prevent crime. Republicans generally support <a href="Gun_politics_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">gun ownership rights</a> and oppose laws regulating guns, although some Republicans in urban areas sometimes favor limited restrictions on the grounds that they are necessary to protect safety in large cities.</p>
<p>Most Republicans support <a href="school_choice" title="wikilink">school choice</a> through <a href="charter_school" title="wikilink">charter schools</a> and <a href="school_voucher" title="wikilink">school vouchers</a> for private schools; many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the <a href="No_Child_Left_Behind_Act" title="wikilink">No Child Left Behind Act</a> of 2001. Many Republicans, however, opposed the creation of the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Education" title="wikilink">United States Department of Education</a> when it was initially created in 1979.</p>
<p>Some in the religious wing of the party support voluntary <a href="School_prayer" title="wikilink">organized prayer in public schools</a> and the teaching of <a href="intelligent_design" title="wikilink">intelligent design</a> in science classes. Although the GOP has voted for increases in government funding of scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding of <a href="embryonic_stem_cell" title="wikilink">embryonic stem cell</a> research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> (which many consider ethically equivalent to <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a>), while arguing for applying research money into <a href="adult_stem_cell" title="wikilink">adult stem cell</a> or amniotic stem cell research. The stem cell issue has garnered two once-rare vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush, who said the research &quot;crossed a moral boundary&quot;.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most Republicans have opposed government recognition of same-sex unions such as with <a href="Same-sex_marriage_in_the_U.S." title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a>. This opposition formed a key method of energizing conservative voters, the Republican base, in the 2004 election. A <em>New York Times</em> and <a href="CBS_News" title="wikilink">CBS News</a> collaborative poll released in April 2009 reported that 18% of Republicans favored recognition of same-sex marriage.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> An August 2010 Fox poll found 19% support.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Historically, most Republicans have opposed LGBT people serving openly in the military and supported the '<a href="Don&#39;t_Ask,_Don&#39;t_Tell" title="wikilink">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a>' policy. However, majorities of 52% and 58% among Republicans in both 2004 and 2009 opposed the policy and supported open enlistment, according to Gallup polling.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="national-defense-and-military-spending">National defense and military spending</h3>
<p>Although the Republican Party has always advocated a strong national defense, historically they disapproved of interventionist foreign policy actions. Republicans opposed <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s intervention in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and his subsequent attempt to create the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>. They were also staunchly opposed to intervention in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> prior to the Japanese attack on <a href="Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Pearl Harbor</a>. In the 1990s, although <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H. W. Bush</a> supported fighting in the <a href="Gulf_War" title="wikilink">Gulf War</a>, Republicans opposed the intervention of the United States in <a href="Somalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> and the <a href="Balkans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkans</a>; and in 2000, <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> ran on a platform that opposed these types of involvement in foreign conflicts.</p>
<p>Today, some in the Republican Party support <a href="unilateralism" class="uri" title="wikilink">unilateralism</a> on issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and <a href="international_relations" title="wikilink">international relations</a> is heavily influenced by the theories of <a href="Neorealism_(international_relations)" title="wikilink">neorealism</a> and <a href="Political_realism" title="wikilink">realism</a>, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's <a href="Evil_empire" title="wikilink">Evil Empire</a> stance on the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and George W. Bush's <a href="Axis_of_evil" title="wikilink">Axis of evil</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans secured gains in the <a href="United_States_congressional_elections,_2002" title="wikilink">2002</a> and <a href="United_States_congressional_elections,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 elections</a>, with the <a href="War_on_Terror" title="wikilink">War on Terror</a> being one of the top issues favoring them. Since the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, some in the party support <a href="neoconservatism" title="wikilink">neoconservative</a> policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">2001 war in Afghanistan</a> and the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>The doctrine of <a href="preemptive_war" title="wikilink">preemptive war</a>, wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack, has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration, but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party. <a href="Rudy_Giuliani" title="wikilink">Rudy Giuliani</a>, mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and a candidate for the Republican <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">presidential nomination in 2008</a>, has stated his support for that policy, saying America must keep itself &quot;on the offensive&quot; against terrorists.</p>
<p>The Bush administration took the position that the <a href="Geneva_Conventions" title="wikilink">Geneva Conventions</a> do not apply to <a href="unlawful_combatant" title="wikilink">unlawful combatants</a>, saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of <a href="nation_state" title="wikilink">nation states</a> and not <a href="List_of_designated_terrorist_organizations" title="wikilink">terrorist organizations</a> such as <a href="Al-Qaeda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Qaeda</a>. The Supreme Court overruled this position in <em><a href="Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld" title="wikilink">Hamdan v.

Prominent Republicans such as Senator <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a>, Governor <a href="Mike_Huckabee" title="wikilink">Mike Huckabee</a>, and Representative <a href="Ron_Paul" title="wikilink">Ron Paul</a> strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture.</p>
<h3 id="other-international-policies">Other international policies</h3>

Some Republicans oppose the <a href="Kyoto_Protocol" title="wikilink">Kyoto Protocol</a> while others have supported it. The party strongly promotes <a href="free_trade" title="wikilink">free trade</a> agreements, most notably <a href="North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement" title="wikilink">NAFTA</a>, <a href="Dominican_Republic&amp;nbsp;&lt;U+2013&gt;_Central_America_Free_Trade_Agreement" title="wikilink">CAFTA</a> and now an effort to go further south to <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a> and <a href="Colombia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colombia</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans are divided on how to confront <a href="illegal_immigration" title="wikilink">illegal immigration</a> between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines, and enforcement-first nationalist approach. In general, pro-growth advocates within the Republican Party support more immigration, and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it. In 2006, the White House supported and Senate passed <a href="Comprehensive_Immigration_Reform_Act_of_2006" title="wikilink">comprehensive immigration reform</a> that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, taking an enforcement-first approach, refused to go along.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

The party has recently nominated African American candidates for senator or governor in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland, though none were successful.

They became one of the core components of the <a href="New_Deal_Coalition" title="wikilink">New Deal Coalition</a>. In the South, blacks were able to vote in large numbers after 1965, when a bipartisan coalition passed the <a href="Voting_Rights_Act" title="wikilink">Voting Rights Act</a>, and ever since have formed a significant portion (20-50%) of the Democratic vote in that region.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Military</em></strong>. Republicans hold a large majority in the armed services, with 57% of active military personnel and 66% of officers identified as Republican in 2003.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Education</em></strong>. Self-identified Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to have 4-year college degrees. The trends for the years 1955 through 2004 are shown by gender in the graphs below, reproduced with permission from <em>Democrats and Republicans &lt;U+2014&gt; Rhetoric and Reality</em>, a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> These graphs depict results obtained by Fried from the National Election Studies (NES) database.</p>
<p><img src="Fig_57_-_men_4-yr_college_degrees.JPG" title="fig:Fig_57_-_men_4-yr_college_degrees.JPG" alt="Fig_57_-_men_4-yr_college_degrees.JPG" width="375" /> <img src="Fig_58_women_with_4-yr_college_degs.JPG" title="fig:Fig_58_women_with_4-yr_college_degs.JPG" alt="Fig_58_women_with_4-yr_college_degs.JPG" width="375" /></p>
<p>Regarding graduate-level degrees (masters or doctorate), there is a rough parity between Democrats and Republicans. According to the Gallup Organization: &quot;[B]oth Democrats and Republicans have equal numbers of Americans at the upper end of the educational spectrum &lt;U+2014&gt; that is, with post graduate degrees...&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Fried provides a slightly more detailed analysis, noting that Republican men are more likely than Democratic men to have advanced degrees, but Democratic women are now more likely than Republican women to have advanced degrees.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Republicans remain a small minority of college professors, with 11% of full-time faculty identifying as Republican.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. The Democrats do better among younger Americans and Republicans among older Americans. In 2006, the GOP won 38% of the voters aged 18&lt;U+2013&gt;29.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Sexual Orientation</em></strong>. Exit polls conducted in 2000, 2004 and 2006 indicate that about one quarter of gay and lesbian Americans voted for the GOP. In recent years, many in the party have opposed <a href="same-sex_marriage" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a>, adoption by same-sex couples, inclusion of sexual orientation in federal hate crimes laws, the <a href="Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act" title="wikilink">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a>, while supporting the use of the <a href="don&#39;t_ask,_don&#39;t_tell" title="wikilink">don't ask, don't tell</a> policy within the military. Some members of the party, particularly in the Northeast and Pacific coast, support <a href="civil_union" title="wikilink">civil unions</a> and adoption rights for same-sex couples.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The opposition to some gay rights found in the Republican Party largely comes from the socially conservative wing of the party.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Religion</em></strong>. Religion has always played a major role for both parties but, in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1960" title="wikilink">1960</a>, with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the late 1960s that undercut the <a href="New_Deal_coalition" title="wikilink">New Deal coalition</a>. Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004</a>; those who attend occasionally gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">Kerry</a> was Catholic). Since 1980, large majorities of <a href="evangelism" title="wikilink">evangelicals</a> have voted Republican; 70&lt;U+2013&gt;80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for GOP House candidates in <a href="United_States_general_elections,_2006" title="wikilink">2006</a>. Jews continue to vote 70&lt;U+2013&gt;80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the <a href="National_Baptist_Convention,_USA,_Inc." title="wikilink">National Baptists</a>, while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54-46 in the 2010 midterms.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The main line traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). Their church memberships have declined in that time as well, and the conservative evangelical rivals have grown. Members of <a href="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="wikilink">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, commonly known as <a href="Mormon" title="wikilink">Mormons</a>, are overwhelmingly Republican and vote in line with the Christian Right. George W. Bush received 89% of the Mormon vote.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Bush also received almost 80% of the <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> vote in the 2000 Presidential election. However, his support among Muslims declined sharply and, by the 2004 election, at least half of those voters supported <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> candidate <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a> or a third party candidate.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Location</em></strong>. Since 1980, geographically the Republican &quot;base&quot; (&quot;<a href="Red_states_and_blue_states" title="wikilink">red states</a>&quot;) is strongest in the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">South</a>, the <a href="Midwest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midwest</a>, and <a href="Mountain_States" title="wikilink">Mountain West</a>. While it is weakest on the <a href="West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast</a> and <a href="Northeastern_United_States" title="wikilink">Northeast</a> this has not always been the case; historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party with <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a> and <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> being the only two states to vote against <a href="Franklin_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin Roosevelt</a> all four times. The <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwest</a> has been roughly balanced since 1854, with <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> becoming more Democratic and liberal because of the city of Chicago and <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> and <a href="Wisconsin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a> more Republican since 1990. <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> and <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> both trend Republican. Since the 1930s, the Democrats have dominated most central cities, while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of suburbs.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The South has become solidly Republican in national elections since 1980, and has been trending Republican at the state level since then at a slower pace.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%-30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70-30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80-20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>The Republican Party's strongest focus of political influence lies in the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> states, particularly <a href="Oklahoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a>, <a href="Nebraska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a>, <a href="South_Dakota" title="wikilink">South Dakota</a>, and <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>, and in the <a href="Mountain_states" title="wikilink">Mountain states</a> of <a href="Idaho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idaho</a>, <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a> (Utah gave George W. Bush more than 70% of the popular vote in 2004). These states are sparsely populated with few major urban centers, and have majority white populations, making it extremely difficult for Democrats to create a sustainable voter base there. Unlike the South, these areas have been strongly Republican since before the party realignments of the 1960s. The Great Plains states were one of the few areas of the country where Republicans had any significant support during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conservatives and Moderates</em></strong>. Republican &quot;conservatives&quot; are strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from religious conservatives. The &quot;<a href="moderate" title="wikilink">moderates</a>&quot; tend to dominate the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as <a href="Thomas_E._Dewey" title="wikilink">Thomas E. Dewey</a>, <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, <a href="Nelson_Rockefeller" title="wikilink">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, and <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>, they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents. In <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a>, <a href="Jim_Jeffords" title="wikilink">Jim Jeffords</a>, a Republican Senator became an <a href="Independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">independent</a> in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership. In addition, moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several New England States, while <a href="Lincoln_Chafee" title="wikilink">Lincoln Chafee</a>, a former moderate Republican senator is currently the independent governor of Rhode Island. Senators <a href="Olympia_Snowe" title="wikilink">Olympia Snowe</a> and <a href="Susan_Collins" title="wikilink">Susan Collins</a> of <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> and Senator <a href="Scott_Brown" title="wikilink">Scott Brown</a> of <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> are notable moderate Republicans from New England. From 1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as Governor of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, <a href="talk_radio" title="wikilink">talk radio</a> audiences and hosts have tended to favor conservative causes. Some well-known radio hosts include <a href="Rush_Limbaugh" title="wikilink">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href="Sean_Hannity" title="wikilink">Sean Hannity</a>, <a href="Glenn_Beck" title="wikilink">Glenn Beck</a>, <a href="Neal_Boortz" title="wikilink">Neal Boortz</a>, <a href="Laura_Ingraham" title="wikilink">Laura Ingraham</a>, <a href="Michael_Reagan" title="wikilink">Michael Reagan</a>, <a href="Howie_Carr" title="wikilink">Howie Carr</a>, and <a href="Michael_Savage_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Michael Savage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="trends">Trends</h2>
<p>As of 2004, the Republican Party had remained fairly cohesive, as both strong <a href="Economic_liberalism" title="wikilink">economic libertarians</a> and <a href="Social_conservatism" title="wikilink">social conservatives</a> opposed the Democrats, whom they saw as the party of bloated and more secular, liberal government.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Yet, some libertarians have argued that the GOP's policies have grown increasingly restrictive of personal liberties, and has contributed to increasing <a href="corporate_welfare" title="wikilink">corporate welfare</a> and <a href="national_debt" title="wikilink">national debt</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Some social conservatives have expressed dissatisfaction with the party's support for economic policies that they see as sometimes in conflict with their moral values.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

Unmarried women voted for Kerry by a 25-point margin (62 to 37 percent), while married women voted for President Bush by an 11-point margin (55 percent to 44 percent). Indeed, the 25-point margin Kerry posted among unmarried women represented one of the high water marks for the Senator among all demographic groups.&quot;<a href="#fnref59" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
