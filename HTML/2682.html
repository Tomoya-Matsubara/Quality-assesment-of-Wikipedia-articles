<p>The city was founded by <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="Ancient_Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinthians</a> and <a href="Tenea" title="wikilink">Teneans</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and became a very powerful <a href="city-state" class="uri" title="wikilink">city-state</a>. Syracuse was allied with <a href="History_of_Sparta" title="wikilink">Sparta</a> and <a href="Ancient_Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinth</a> and exerted influence over the entirety of <a href="Magna_Graecia" title="wikilink">Magna Graecia</a>, of which it was the most important city.

<p>Syracuse and its surrounding area have been inhabited since ancient times, as shown by the findings in the villages of Stentinello, Ognina, Plemmirio, Matrensa, Cozzo Pantano and <em>Thapsos</em>, which already had a relationship with <a href="Mycenaean_Greece" title="wikilink">Mycenaean Greece</a>.</p>
<p>Syracuse was founded in 734 or 733 BC by Greek settlers from <a href="Ancient_Corinth" title="wikilink">Corinth</a> and <a href="Tenea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tenea</a>, led by the <em>oecist</em> (colonizer) <a href="Archias_of_Corinth" title="wikilink">Archias</a>.There are many attested variants of the name of the city including  Syrakousai,  Syrakosai and  Syrako.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A possible origin of the city's name was given by <a href="Vibius_Sequester" title="wikilink">Vibius Sequester</a> citing<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> first <a href="Stephanus_Byzantius" title="wikilink">Stephanus Byzantius</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> in that there was a Syracusian marsh () called <em>Syrako</em> and secondly <a href="Marcian_of_Heraclea" title="wikilink">Marcian's</a> <em>Periegesis</em> wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets <em>Syrako</em> (and thereby <em>Syrakousai</em> and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by <a href="Epicharmus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epicharmus</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of <em>Ortygia</em>. The settlers found the land fertile and the <a href="Sicels" title="wikilink">native tribes</a> to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the <a href="Mediterranean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a>. Colonies were founded at <a href="Palazzolo_Acreide" title="wikilink">Akrai</a> (664 BC), <a href="Kasmenai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kasmenai</a> (643 BC), <a href="Akrillai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akrillai</a> (7th century BC), <a href="Helorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helorus</a> (7th century BC) and <a href="Kamarina,_Sicily" title="wikilink">Kamarina</a> (598 BC).</p>
<p>The descendants of the first colonists, called <em>Gamoroi</em>, held power until they were expelled by the <em>Killichiroi</em>, the lower class of the city. The former, however, returned to power in 485 BC, thanks to the help of <a href="Gelo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gelo</a>, ruler of <a href="Gela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gela</a>. Gelo himself became the despot of the city, and moved many inhabitants of Gela, Kamarina and Megera to Syracuse, building the new quarters of Tyche and Neapolis outside the walls. His program of new constructions included a new theatre, designed by <a href="Damocopos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damocopos</a>, which gave the city a flourishing cultural life: this in turn attracted personalities as <a href="Aeschylus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeschylus</a>, Ario of <a href="Metimma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metimma</a>, Eumelos of Corinth and <a href="Sappho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sappho</a>, who had been exiled here from <a href="Mytilene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mytilene</a>. The enlarged power of Syracuse made unavoidable the clash against the <a href="Carthaginian" title="wikilink">Carthaginians</a>, who ruled western Sicily. In the <a href="Battle_of_Himera_(480&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Himera</a>, Gelo, who had allied with Theron of <a href="Agrigento" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agrigento</a>, decisively defeated the African force led by <a href="Hamilcar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamilcar</a>. A <a href="temple" class="uri" title="wikilink">temple</a> dedicated to <a href="Athena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athena</a> (on the site of today's Cathedral), was erected in the city to commemorate the event</p>
<p>Syracuse grew considerably during this time. Its walls encircled  in the fifth century, but as early as the 470's BC the inhabitants started building outside the walls. The complete population of its territory approximately numbered 250,000 in 415 BC and the population size of the city itself was probably similar to Athens.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Gelo was succeeded by his brother <a href="Hiero_I_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hiero</a>, who <a href="Battle_of_Cumae" title="wikilink">fought</a> against the <a href="Etruscan_civilization" title="wikilink">Etruscans</a> at <a href="Cumae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cumae</a> in 474 BC. His rule was eulogized by poets like <a href="Simonides_of_Ceos" title="wikilink">Simonides of Ceos</a>, <a href="Bacchylides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bacchylides</a> and <a href="Pindar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pindar</a>, who visited his court. A democratic regime was introduced by <a href="Thrasybulus_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Thrasybulos</a> (467 BC). The city continued to expand in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, fighting against the rebellious <a href="Siculi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siculi</a>, and on the <a href="Tyrrhenian_Sea" title="wikilink">Tyrrhenian Sea</a>, making expeditions up to <a href="Corsica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corsica</a> and <a href="Elba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elba</a>. In the late 5th century BC, Syracuse found itself at war with <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, which sought more resources to fight the <a href="Peloponnesian_War" title="wikilink">Peloponnesian War</a>. The Syracusans enlisted the aid of a general from <a href="Sparta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sparta</a>, Athens' foe in the war, to defeat the Athenians, destroy their ships, and leave them to starve on the island (see <a href="Sicilian_Expedition" title="wikilink">Sicilian Expedition</a>). In 401 BC, Syracuse contributed a force of 3,000 <a href="hoplites" class="uri" title="wikilink">hoplites</a> and a general to <a href="Cyrus_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Cyrus the Younger</a>'s <a href="Army_of_the_Ten_Thousand" title="wikilink">Army of the Ten Thousand</a>.</p>
<p>Then in the early 4th century BC, the <a href="tyrant" class="uri" title="wikilink">tyrant</a> <a href="Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Dionysius the Elder</a> was again at war against <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a> and, although losing Gela and Camarina, kept that power from capturing the whole of Sicily. After the end of the conflict Dionysius built a massive fortress on the <a href="Ortygia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ortygia</a> island of the city and 22 km-long walls around all of Syracuse. Another period of expansion saw the destruction of <a href="Naxos_(Sicily)" title="wikilink">Naxos</a>, <a href="Catania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catania</a> and <a href="Lentini" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lentini</a>; then Syracuse entered again in war against Carthage (397 BC). After various changes of fortune, the Carthaginians managed to besiege Syracuse itself, but were eventually pushed back by a pestilence. A treaty in 392 BC allowed Syracuse to enlarge further its possessions, founding the cities of Adrano, Tindari and <a href="Taormina" title="wikilink">Tauromenos</a>, and conquering <a href="Reggio_Calabria" title="wikilink">Rhegion</a> on the continent. In the <a href="Adriatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adriatic</a>, to facilitate trade, <a href="Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Dionysius the Elder</a> founded <a href="Ancona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ancona</a>, <a href="Adria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adria</a> and <a href="Vis_(island)" title="wikilink">Issa</a>. Apart from his battle deeds, Dionysius was famous as a patron of art, and <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a> himself visited Syracuse several times.</p>
<p>His successor was <a href="Dionysius_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Dionysius the Younger</a>, who was however expelled by <a href="Dion_(tyrant_of_Syracuse)" title="wikilink">Dion</a> in 356 BC. But the latter's despotic rule led in turn to his expulsion, and Dionysius reclaimed his throne in 347 BC. A democratic government was installed by <a href="Timoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timoleon</a> in 345 BC. The long series of internal struggles had weakened Syracuse's power on the island, and Timoleon tried to remedy this, defeating the Carthaginians in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Crimissus" title="wikilink">Battle of the Crimissus</a> (339 BC). But the struggle among the city's parties restarted after his death and ended with the rise of another tyrant, <a href="Agathocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agathocles</a>, who seized power with a coup in 317 BC. He resumed the war against Carthage, with alternate fortunes. However he scored a moral success, bringing the war to the Carthaginians' native African soil, inflicting heavy losses to the enemy. The war ended with another treaty of peace which did not prevent the Carthaginians from interfering in the politics of Syracuse after the death of Agathocles (289 BC). The citizens called <a href="Pyrrhus_of_Epirus" title="wikilink">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a> for help. After a brief period under the rule of Epirus, <a href="Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hiero II</a> seized power in 275 BC.</p>
<p>Hiero inaugurated a period of 50 years of peace and prosperity, in which Syracuse became one of the most renowned capitals of Antiquity. He issued the so-called <em><a href="Lex_Hieronica" title="wikilink">Lex Hieronica</a></em>, which was later adopted by the Romans for their administration of Sicily; he also had the theatre enlarged and a new immense <a href="altar" class="uri" title="wikilink">altar</a>, the &quot;Hiero's Ara&quot;, built. Under his rule lived the most famous Syracusan, the mathematician and <a href="natural_philosophy" title="wikilink">natural philosopher</a> <a href="Archimedes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a>. Among his many inventions were various military engines including the <a href="claw_of_Archimedes" title="wikilink">claw of Archimedes</a>, later used to resist the <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(214&lt;U+2013&gt;212&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">Roman siege</a> of 214 BC&lt;U+2013&gt;212 BC. Literary figures included <a href="Theocritus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theocritus</a> and others.</p>
<p>Hiero's successor, the young <a href="Hieronymus_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hieronymus</a> (ruled from 215 BC), broke the alliance with the Romans after their defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Cannae" title="wikilink">Battle of Cannae</a> and accepted <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a>'s support. The Romans, led by consul <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" title="wikilink">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a>, <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(214&lt;U+2013&gt;212&amp;nbsp;BC)" title="wikilink">besieged the city</a> in 214 BC. The city held out for three years, but fell in 212 BC. The successes of the Syracusians in repelling the Roman siege had made them overconfident. In 212 BC, the Romans received information that the city's inhabitants were to participate in the annual festival to their goddess Artemis. A small party of Roman soldiers approached the city under the cover of night and managed to scale the walls to get into the outer city and with reinforcements soon took control, killing Archimedes in the process, but the main fortress remained firm. After an eight-month siege and with parleys in progress, an Iberian captain named Moeriscus is believed to have let the Romans in near the Fountains of Arethusa. On the agreed signal, during a diversionary attack, he opened the gate. After setting guards on the houses of the pro-Roman faction, Marcellus gave Syracuse to plunder.</p>

It remained an important port for trade between the Eastern and the Western parts of the Empire. <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> spread in the city through the efforts of <a href="Paul_of_Tarsus" title="wikilink">Paul of Tarsus</a> and Saint Marziano, the first bishop of the city, who made it one of the main centres of <a href="proselytism" class="uri" title="wikilink">proselytism</a> in the West. In the age of persecutions massive <a href="catacomb" title="wikilink">catacombs</a> were carved, whose size is second only to those of Rome.</p>
<p>After a period of <a href="Vandal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vandal</a> rule, Syracuse and the island was recovered by <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a> for the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a> (31 December 535). From 663 to 668 Syracuse was the seat of Emperor <a href="Constans_II_(Byzantine_Empire)" title="wikilink">Constans II</a>, as well as metropolis of the whole Sicilian Church.</p>
<p>The city was <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(827&lt;U+2013&gt;828)" title="wikilink">besieged</a> by the <a href="Aghlabids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aghlabids</a> for almost a year in 827&lt;U+2013&gt;828, but Byzantine reinforcements prevented its fall. It remained the center of Byzantine resistance to the gradual <a href="Muslim_conquest_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Muslim conquest of Sicily</a> until it fell to the Aghlabids after <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(877&lt;U+2013&gt;878)" title="wikilink">another siege</a> on 20/21 May 878. During the two centuries of <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> rule, the capital of the <a href="Emirate_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Emirate of Sicily</a> was moved from Syracuse to <a href="Palermo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palermo</a>. The Cathedral was converted into a <a href="mosque" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosque</a> and the quarter on the Ortygia island was gradually rebuilt along Islamic styles. The city, nevertheless, maintained important trade relationships, and housed a relatively flourishing cultural and artistic life: several Arab poets, including <a href="Ibn_Hamdis" title="wikilink">Ibn Hamdis</a>, the most important <a href="Siculo-Arabic" title="wikilink">Sicilian Arab</a> poet of the 12th century, flourished in the city.</p>
<p>In 1038, the Byzantine general <a href="George_Maniakes" title="wikilink">George Maniakes</a> reconquered the city, sending the relics of St. Lucy to <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>. The eponymous castle on the cape of Ortygia bears his name, although it was built under the <a href="Hohenstaufen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hohenstaufen</a> rule. In 1085 the <a href="Normans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normans</a> entered Syracuse, one of the last <a href="Arab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arab</a> strongholds, after a summer-long siege by <a href="Roger_I_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Roger I of Sicily</a> and his son <a href="Jordan_of_Hauteville" title="wikilink">Jordan of Hauteville</a>, who was given the city as count. New quarters were built, and the cathedral was restored, as well as other churches.</p>
<h3 id="high-medieval-period">High medieval period</h3>
<p>In 1194, <a href="Emperor_Henry_VI" title="wikilink">Emperor Henry VI</a> occupied the Sicilian kingdom, including Syracuse. After a short period of <a href="Genoa#Middle_Ages_and_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Genoese</a> rule (1205&lt;U+2013&gt;1220) under the notorious admiral and pirate <a href="Alamanno_da_Costa" title="wikilink">Alamanno da Costa</a>, which favoured a rise of trades, royal authority was re-asserted in the city by <a href="Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick II</a>. He began the construction of the <a href="Castello_Maniace" title="wikilink">Castello Maniace</a>, the Bishops' Palace and the Bellomo Palace. Frederick's death brought a period of unrest and feudal anarchy. In the <a href="War_of_the_Sicilian_Vespers" title="wikilink">War of the Sicilian Vespers</a> between the <a href="Capetian_House_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Angevin</a> and <a href="Crown_of_Aragon" title="wikilink">Aragonese</a> dynasties for control of Sicily, Syracuse sided with the Aragonese and expelled the Angevins in 1298, receiving from the Spanish sovereigns great privileges in reward. The preeminence of baronal families is also shown by the construction of the palaces of <a href="Abela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abela</a>, <a href="Chiaramonte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chiaramonte</a>, Nava, Montalto.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-16th-century-to-the-20th-century">From the 16th century to the 20th century</h3>
<p>The city was struck by two ruinous earthquakes in 1542 and <a href="1693_Sicily_earthquake" title="wikilink">1693</a>, and a plague in 1729. The 17th century destruction changed forever the appearance of Syracuse, as well as the entire <a href="Val_di_Noto" title="wikilink">Val di Noto</a>, whose cities were rebuilt along the typical lines of <a href="Sicilian_Baroque" title="wikilink">Sicilian Baroque</a>, considered one of the most typical expressions of art of Southern Italy. The spread of <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a> in 1837 led to a revolt against the <a href="House_of_Bourbon" title="wikilink">Bourbon</a> government. The punishment was the move of the province capital seat to <a href="Noto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Noto</a>, but the unrest had not been totally choked, as the Siracusani took part in the <a href="Sicilian_revolution_of_independence_of_1848" title="wikilink">Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="Unification_of_Italy" title="wikilink">Unification of Italy</a> of 1865, Syracuse regained its status of provincial capital. In 1870 the walls were demolished and a bridge connecting the mainland to Ortygia island was built. In the following year a railway link was constructed.</p>

<p>Heavy destruction was caused by the Allied and the German bombings in 1943. <em>Operation Husky</em>, the codename for the <a href="Allied_invasion_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>, was launched on the night of 9/10 July 1943 with British forces attacking the west of the island. <a href="Bernard_Montgomery,_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein" title="wikilink">General Montgomery's</a> <a href="Eighth_Army_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Eighth Army</a> captured Syracuse on the first day of the invasion almost unopposed.

<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>In 2007, there were 122,972 people residing in Syracuse, located in the province of Syracuse, <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, of whom 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 18.87 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 16.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Syracuse resident is 40 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Syracuse declined by 0.49 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The reason for decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and <a href="northern_Italy" title="wikilink">northern Italy</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The current birth rate of Syracuse is 9.75 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.</p>
