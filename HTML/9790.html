<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Liu Yan was born in <a href="889" class="uri" title="wikilink">889</a>, during the reign of <a href="Emperor_Zhaozong_of_Tang" title="wikilink">Emperor Zhaozong of Tang</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His father <a href="Liu_Zhiqian" title="wikilink">Liu Zhiqian</a> (also known as Liu Qian) was then the prefect of Feng Prefecture (&lt;U+5C01&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Zhaoqing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhaoqing</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>) and was married to a Lady Wei, the niece of Wei Zhou (&lt;U+97CB&gt;&lt;U+5B99&gt;), a prior military governor (<em><a href="Jiedushi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiedushi</a></em>) of Lingnan East Circuit (&lt;U+5DBA&gt;&lt;U+5357&gt;&lt;U+6771&gt;&lt;U+9053&gt;, headquartered in modern <a href="Guangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>), which Feng Prefecture belonged to. However, he also secretly had a <a href="concubine" class="uri" title="wikilink">concubine</a> outside the home, a Lady Duan, and it was to Lady Duan that Liu Yan was born. When Lady Wei found out, she killed Lady Duan, but could not bear to kill the infant Liu Yan, and she took him back home to be raised as her own, as a younger brother to her own sons <a href="Liu_Yin_(Southern_Han)" title="wikilink">Liu Yin</a> and Liu Tai (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+53F0&gt;).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>As Liu Yan grew up, it was said that was tall and capable in both horsemanship and archery.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> After Liu Yin became the commander of the army of the circuit (which had been renamed Qinghai (&lt;U+6E05&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;)) by that point under the military governor <a href="Li_Zhirou" title="wikilink">Li Zhirou</a> the Prince of Xue in <a href="896" class="uri" title="wikilink">896</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Liu Yan was also given the title of military advisor to Li Zhirou as the Prince of Xue, and his name was changed from Liu Yan to Liu Zhi.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="service-under-liu-yin">Service under Liu Yin</h2>
<p>In <a href="901" class="uri" title="wikilink">901</a>, Li Zhirou's successor <a href="Xu_Yanruo" title="wikilink">Xu Yanruo</a> died, leaving a recommendation to Emperor Zhaozong that Liu Yin be made acting military governor, and Liu Yin subsequently took that title.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Liu Zhi continued serving under his brother, and was first recorded to have participated in a campaign in <a href="902" class="uri" title="wikilink">902</a>, when <a href="Lu_Guangchou" title="wikilink">Lu Guangchou</a>, who controlled the Qian Prefecture (&lt;U+8654&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Ganzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ganzhou</a>, <a href="Jiangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiangxi</a>) region as Qian's prefect, attacked Qinghai, capturing Shao Prefecture (&lt;U+97F6&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Shaoguan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shaoguan</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>) and giving it to his son <a href="Lu_Yanchang" title="wikilink">Lu Yanchang</a>, and then putting Chao Prefecture (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Chaozhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaozhou</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>) under siege. Liu Yin personally led an army and repelled Lu Guangchou from Chao, and then prepared to attack Shao. Under Liu Zhi's advice (as Liu Zhi believed that a direct attack would not be successful due to the strength of Lu Yanchang's army), he put Shao under siege to try to wear out Lu Yanchang's defense, but the strategy backfired when, due to high water levels on the river, the Qinghai army's food supplies were disrupted. Lu Guangchou then launched a relief army from Qian, repelling Liu Yin from Shao.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned the <a href="chancellor_of_Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">chancellor</a> <a href="Cui_Yuan_(Late_Tang)" title="wikilink">Cui Yuan</a> as the new military governor of Qinghai, but Cui, while on the way to Qinghai, heard about popular uprisings in the region and also was worried that Liu Yin would not yield the position to him, and therefore returned to then-capital <a href="Luoyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a>. Subsequently, after Liu Yin bribed the powerful warlord <a href="Emperor_Taizu_of_Later_Liang" title="wikilink">Zhu Quanzhong</a> the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (&lt;U+5BA3&gt;&lt;U+6B66&gt;, headquartered in modern <a href="Kaifeng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaifeng</a>, <a href="Henan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Henan</a>), who had the Tang imperial court under his physical control by that point, Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor <a href="Emperor_Ai_of_Tang" title="wikilink">Emperor Ai of Tang</a> commissioned Liu Yin as full military governor in <a href="904" class="uri" title="wikilink">904</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Liu Zhi served as Liu Yin's deputy military governor. It was said that at that time, in addition to the continued conflict with Lu Guangchou, substantial portions of the region were controlled by other warlords &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="Khuc_Hao" title="wikilink">Qu Hao</a> at Jiao Prefecture (&lt;U+4EA4&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Hanoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanoi</a>, <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>); Liu Shizheng (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+58EB&gt;&lt;U+653F&gt;) at Gui Prefecture (&lt;U+6842&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Guilin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guilin</a>, <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>); Ye Guangl&lt;U+00FC&gt;e (&lt;U+8449&gt;&lt;U+5EE3&gt;&lt;U+7565&gt;) at Yong Prefecture (&lt;U+9095&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Nanning" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanning</a>, <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>); Pang Juzhao (&lt;U+9F90&gt;&lt;U+5DE8&gt;&lt;U+662D&gt;) at Rong Prefecture (&lt;U+5BB9&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Yulin,_Guangxi" title="wikilink">Yulin</a>, <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>); Liu Changlu (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+660C&gt;&lt;U+9B6F&gt;) at Gao Prefecture (&lt;U+9AD8&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Maoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maoming</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>); and Liu Qian (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+6F5C&gt;, different person than Liu Zhi's father) at Xin Prefecture (&lt;U+65B0&gt;&lt;U+6D32&gt;, in modern <a href="Yunfu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yunfu</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>). In addition, east of the <a href="Pearl_River_(China)" title="wikilink">Pearl River</a>, there were some 70 camps of people who did not recognize Liu Yin's authorities. It was said that after Liu Yin entrusted the military matters to Liu Zhi, Liu Zhi gradually had these warlords expelled or forced into submission, such that he became known as the preeminent general in the <a href="Lingnan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lingnan</a> region.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>One of these campaigns was described as in or around <a href="910" class="uri" title="wikilink">910</a> (by which time Liu Yin was a vassal of the new <a href="Later_Liang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Later Liang Dynasty</a>, which Zhu had established as its Emperor Taizu, and carried the title of Prince of Nanping or Nanhai), when Liu Zhi attacked Liu Changlu at Gao Prefecture. Liu Changlu repelled his attack, but figured that he would not be able to indefinitely hold out against the Liu brothers, and therefore, along with Pang, offered to submit to <a href="Ma_Yin" title="wikilink">Ma Yin</a> the Prince of <a href="Chu_(Ten_Kingdoms)" title="wikilink">Chu</a>. Ma sent troops to safely escort Liu Changlu and Pang back to his territory and had his general Yao Yanzhang (&lt;U+59DA&gt;&lt;U+5F65&gt;&lt;U+7AE0&gt;) take up garrison at Rong Prefecture.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="911" class="uri" title="wikilink">911</a>, Liu Yin grew deathly ill. He submitted a petition recommending Liu Zhi as acting military governor, and died shortly after. Liu Zhi took over the circuit. Shortly after, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu made Liu Zhi full military governor.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His name was changed back to Liu Yan.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="as-military-governor">As military governor</h2>
<p>It was said that Liu Yan, while serving as military governor, frequently invited members of the intelligentsia who had fled from the <a href="Central_Plain_(China)" title="wikilink">Central Plain</a> to serve on his staff, and often made the prefects of the circuit's prefectures, so among the prefects there were no military officers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, also in 911, Lu Guangchou's son and successor <a href="Lu_Yanchang" title="wikilink">Lu Yanchang</a> was assassinated by his officer <a href="Li_Qiu" title="wikilink">Li Qiu</a>, who subsequently died and was succeeded by another officer, <a href="Li_Yantu" title="wikilink">Li Yantu</a>. As Li Qiu had considered killing Lu Guangchou's chief strategist <a href="Tan_Quanbo" title="wikilink">Tan Quanbo</a>, Tan claimed to be ill and retired from the Qian Prefecture army. Hearing of this, Liu Yan dispatched an army to attack Shao Prefecture and captured it; its prefect Liao Shuang (&lt;U+5ED6&gt;&lt;U+723D&gt;) fled to Chu, allowing Liu Yan to take Shao under his control. Meanwhile, he also again attacked Rong Prefecture. Yao Yanzhang was unable to stand up against his attacks despite being aided by a Chu relief force commanded by <a href="Xu_Dexun" title="wikilink">Xu Dexun</a>, so Yao took the people and left Rong Prefecture, allowing Liu to take control of the Rong Prefecture region, as well as Gao Prefecture. Hearing of the war between two of his vassals, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu sent a delegation led by the official Wei Jian (&lt;U+97CB&gt;&lt;U+6229&gt;) to try to mediate a peace between Ma and Liu.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Liu responded by sending a large tribute of gold, silver, rhinoceros horns, ivory, and other assorted jewels and spices, to Emperor Taizu<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated and succeeded by his son <a href="Zhu_Yougui" title="wikilink">Zhu Yougui</a> the Prince of Ying.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In early <a href="913" class="uri" title="wikilink">913</a>, Zhu Yougui bestowed the honorary title of acting <em>Taifu</em> (&lt;U+592A&gt;&lt;U+5085&gt;, &quot;emperor's professor&quot;) on Liu.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He was subsequently defeated in a countercoup led by his brother <a href="Zhu_Zhen" title="wikilink">Zhu Youzhen</a> the Prince of Jun and committed suicide. Zhu Youzhen, who took the throne and changed his name to Zhu Zhen,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> then gave Liu the title of not only military governor of Qinghai, but also of Jianwu Circuit (&lt;U+5EFA&gt;&lt;U+6B66&gt;, headquartered at Yong Prefecture), and also created him the Prince of Nanping, a title previously held by Liu Yin.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 913, Liu Yan sought a marital alliance with Ma Yin, and Ma agreed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In <a href="915" class="uri" title="wikilink">915</a>, Liu sent a delegation to Chu's capital <a href="Changsha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Changsha</a> to welcome Ma's <a href="Empress_Ma_(Gaozu)" title="wikilink">Empress Ma</a> daughter as his bride, and Ma sent his brother Ma Cun (&lt;U+99AC&gt;&lt;U+5B58&gt;) to escort her to Qinghai. Meanwhile, Liu was dissatisfied that he was only given the title of Prince of Nanping, while another Later Liang vassal, <a href="Qian_Liu" title="wikilink">Qian Liu</a>, carried the greater title of Prince of Wuyue. He made a request to Zhu Zhen that he be created the similarly-honored title of Prince of Nanyue and be given a further title as commander of the circuits. When Zhu Zhen refused, Liu commented:<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Thereafter, Liu stopped sending tributes and emissaries to the Later Liang court.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In fall <a href="917" class="uri" title="wikilink">917</a>, Liu went further and declared himself emperor of a new state of Yue, at his capital of Panyu (which he renamed Xingwang). He posthumously honored his grandfather Liu Anren (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+5B89&gt;&lt;U+4EC1&gt;), father Liu Qian, and brother Liu Yin as emperors.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He commissioned the Later Liang emissaries <a href="Zhao_Guangyi_(Southern_Han)" title="wikilink">Zhao Guangyi</a> and <a href="Li_Yinheng" title="wikilink">Li Yinheng</a> (who were previously detained by Liu Yin),<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> as well as his deputy military governor <a href="Yang_Dongqian" title="wikilink">Yang Dongqian</a>, <a href="chancellor_of_Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">chancellors</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="as-emperor-of-yue">As emperor of Yue</h2>
<p>Also in 917, Liu Yan gave his niece, <a href="Princess_Liu_Hua" title="wikilink">Liu Hua</a>, the daughter of his brother Liu Yin, whom he had created the Princess Qingyuan, in marriage to <a href="Wang_Yanjun" title="wikilink">Wang Yanjun</a>, a son of his northeastern neighbor <a href="Wang_Shenzhi" title="wikilink">Wang Shenzhi</a> the Prince of <a href="Min_(Ten_Kingdoms)" title="wikilink">Min</a> (who remained a Later Liang vassal), to cement a relationship between the two states.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="918" class="uri" title="wikilink">918</a>, after Liu Yan offered sacrifices to heaven and earth and issued a general pardon, he changed the name of his state from Yue to Han (and thus his state became known as Southern Han).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="early-reign">Early reign</h3>
<p>In <a href="919" class="uri" title="wikilink">919</a>, Liu Yan created his wife Lady Ma empress.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="920" class="uri" title="wikilink">920</a>, at Yang Dongqian's request, Liu Yan established schools and <a href="imperial_examination" title="wikilink">imperial examinations</a>, apparently following the Tang model. He also sent emissaries to <a href="Former_Shu" title="wikilink">Former Shu</a>, seeking friendly relations.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="922" class="uri" title="wikilink">922</a>, there was an incident where Liu Yan, believing in the words of the sorcerer that he needed to leave the capital to avoid a disaster, left Xingwang to visit Meikou (&lt;U+6885&gt;&lt;U+53E3&gt;, in modern <a href="Meizhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meizhou</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>), near the Min border. The Min general Wang Yanmei (Wang Shenzhi's son or nephew) decided to launch a surprise attack on Liu Yan's train, but before Wang Yanmei's forces arrived, Liu Yan received the news and fled Meikou before Min forces could attack.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="924" class="uri" title="wikilink">924</a>, Liu Yan launched an attack on Min, advancing on the borders of Min's Ting (&lt;U+6C40&gt;&lt;U+6D32&gt;, in modern <a href="Longyan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longyan</a>, <a href="Fujian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fujian</a>) and Zhang (&lt;U+6F33&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Zhangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhangzhou</a>, <a href="Fujian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fujian</a>) Prefectures. A Min counterattack defeated him, and he fled.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in <a href="923" class="uri" title="wikilink">923</a>, Later Liang had been conquered by its northern rival <a href="Jin_(Five_Dynasties)" title="wikilink">Jin</a>, whose prince <a href="Emperor_Zhuangzong_of_Later_Tang" title="wikilink">Li Cunxu</a> declared himself the emperor of a new <a href="Later_Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Later Tang Dynasty</a> (as Emperor Zhuangzong).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> When the news reached Liu Yan, Liu Yan became fearful of this powerful new state in the north, and in <a href="925" class="uri" title="wikilink">925</a> sent his official He Ci (&lt;U+4F55&gt;&lt;U+8A5E&gt;) to Later Tang to try to seek friendly relations in humble terms<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> (referring to himself as &quot;the King of the Great Han&quot; rather than emperor while addressing Emperor Zhuangzong as &quot;the Emperor of the Great Tang&quot;)<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and to find out more about the strength of this new dynasty. After He Ci returned, He Ci reported that Emperor Zhuangzong had become arrogant and excessive and that there was no need to be fearful of him; Liu Yan was pleased, and from this point on no longer sought communications with Later Tang.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in the year, it was said that a white dragon was discovered in the Han palace. In response, Liu Yan changed his <a href="era_name" title="wikilink">era name</a> to <em>Bailong</em> (&quot;white dragon&quot;) and changed his own name to Gong (&lt;U+9F94&gt;).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, later in the year, when foreign monks informed him that the character &quot;Gong&quot; was not favorable to Southern Han's fortune, he further changed his name to a newly created character (&lt;U+9F91&gt;), showing the character of a dragon (&lt;U+9F8D&gt;) over that of heaven (&lt;U+5929&gt;), pronouncing the newly created character &quot;Yan.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> (The <em><a href="Zizhi_Tongjian" title="wikilink">Zizhi Tongjian</a></em> placed this second name change in <a href="941" class="uri" title="wikilink">941</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>) Also in 925, when Zheng Min (&lt;U+912D&gt;&lt;U+65FB&gt;) the emperor of <a href="Nanzhao_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Changhe</a>, sent his brother Zheng Zhaochun (&lt;U+912D&gt;&lt;U+662D&gt;&lt;U+6DF3&gt;) to Southern Han to seek a marriage alliance, Liu Yan gave another niece, the Princess Zengcheng, to Zheng Min in marriage.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="middle-reign">Middle reign</h3>
<p>In <a href="928" class="uri" title="wikilink">928</a>, a Chu fleet attacked Southern Han and put Feng Prefecture under siege. In response, Liu Yan, believing that <em>Dayou</em> was a phrase from the <em><a href="I_Ching" title="wikilink">I Ching</a></em> that would portend good fortune in battle, changed the era name to <em>Dayou</em>, and also sent the general Su Zhang (&lt;U+8607&gt;&lt;U+7AE0&gt;) to take a fleet manned with well-trained archers to try to lift the siege on Feng. Su engaged the Chu fleet and pretended to withdraw after a skirmish, inducing the Chu fleet to chase; he then caught the Chu fleet in an ambush and defeated it, forcing the Chu forces to withdraw.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="930" class="uri" title="wikilink">930</a>, Liu Yan sent his generals Liang Kezhen (&lt;U+6881&gt;&lt;U+514B&gt;&lt;U+8C9E&gt;) and Li Shoufu (&lt;U+674E&gt;&lt;U+5B88&gt;&lt;U+911C&gt;) to attack Jiao Prefecture; they captured it and took Qu Chengmei (&lt;U+66F2&gt;&lt;U+627F&gt;&lt;U+7F8E&gt;, <a href="Vietnamese_language" title="wikilink">Vietnamese</a> Kh&lt;U+00FA&gt;c Th&lt;U+1EEB&gt;a M&lt;U+1EF9&gt;, son and successor of Qu Hao) captive, taking (for the time being) Jinghai Circuit (&lt;U+975C&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;, headquartered at Jiao Prefecture) under Southern Han control and ending the control of the circuit by the <a href="Khuc_family" title="wikilink">Khuc family</a>. Liang further advanced to <a href="Champa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Champa</a> and pillaged it of its treasure. Liu stationed his general Li Jin (&lt;U+674E&gt;&lt;U+9032&gt;) at Jiao Prefecture to defend it.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The Southern Han hold on Jinghai would not last long, however. After the fall of the Khucs, <a href="Duong_Dinh_Nghe" title="wikilink">Yang Tingyi</a> the prefect of Ai Prefecture (&lt;U+611B&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Thanh_Hoa_Province" title="wikilink">Thanh Hoa Province</a>, <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>) built up a personal army of 3,000 adoptive sons, wanting to take control of Jinghai. Although Li knew about this, he did nothing as he was receiving regular bribes from Yang. In <a href="931" class="uri" title="wikilink">931</a>, Yang put Jiao Prefecture under siege. Liu Yan sent the general Cheng Bao (&lt;U+7A0B&gt;&lt;U+5BF6&gt;) to try to lift the siege, but before Cheng could get there, the city fell. Li fled back to Xingwang, where Liu put him to death. Cheng tried to recapture Jiao Prefecture, but Yang defeated and killed him in battle.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="932" class="uri" title="wikilink">932</a>, Liu Yan created his 19 sons as imperial princes.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="934" class="uri" title="wikilink">934</a>, Empress Ma died.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 934, Liu Yan allowed his then-surviving oldest son <a href="Liu_Fen" title="wikilink">Liu Hongdu</a> the Prince of Qin (Liu Hongdu's older brothers Liu Yaoshu and Liu Guitu having died earlier)<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> to form a guard force of his own, but these guard ranks were filled with hoodlums that Liu Hongdu was close to. When Yang Dongqian tried to speak on this matter to advise Liu Yan to curb Liu Hongdu's activities, as Liu Hongdu was commonly regarded as the heir, Liu Yan refused to listen. When Yang subsequently observed the guards pillage gold and silk from merchants and the merchants' fear causing them not to report the matter, Yang lamented, &quot;If the rule is as troubled as this, what is a chancellor for?&quot; He thus claimed an illness and refused to his mansion. Liu Yan subsequently never against summoned Yang for any audiences, and Yang eventually died at his home without returning to chancellorship.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="late-reign">Late reign</h3>
<p>In <a href="936" class="uri" title="wikilink">936</a>, Liu Yan sent his general Sun Dewei (&lt;U+5B6B&gt;&lt;U+5FB7&gt;&lt;U+5A01&gt;) to attack Chu's Meng (&lt;U+8499&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Wuzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wuzhou</a>, <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>) and Gui (&lt;U+6842&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, in modern <a href="Guilin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guilin</a>, <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>). When Chu's prince <a href="Ma_Xifan" title="wikilink">Ma Xifan</a> (Ma Yin's son) personally went to Gui Prefecture to defend against the attack, Sun withdrew.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="937" class="uri" title="wikilink">937</a>, Yang Tingyi was killed by his general <a href="Kieu_Cong_Tian" title="wikilink">Jiao Gongxian</a>, who took over Jinghai. In <a href="938" class="uri" title="wikilink">938</a>, when another former general of Yang's, <a href="Ngo_Quyen" title="wikilink">Wu Quan</a>, rose at Ai Prefecture and subsequently attacked Jiao Prefecture, Jiao Gongxian sought aid from Southern Han. Liu Yan wanted to use this opportunity to take over Jinghai again, so he commissioned his son Liu Hongcao as the military governor of Jinghai and changed his title to Prince of Jiao, having him command an army to head to Jiao Prefecture while Liu Yan himself commanded a follow-up army. By the time that Liu Hongcao was approaching Jiao Prefecture, however, Wu had already defeated and killed Jiao Gongxian and occupied Jiao Prefecture. When Liu Hongcao prepared to attack, Wu set a trap for him &lt;U+2014&gt; setting large wooden planks covered with iron into the tidal zone, such that when Liu Hongcao attacked at high tide, the planks were invisible, but when the tide fell, the Southern Han ships became stuck on the planks and unable to move. Wu then counterattacked, killing more than half of the Southern Han soldiers, including Liu Hongcao. Liu Yan, hearing the news, cried bitterly and withdrew his own fleet.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> (This became known as the <a href="Battle_of_Bach_Dang_River_(938)" title="wikilink">Battle of Bach Dang River</a>.)</p>
<p>In <a href="939" class="uri" title="wikilink">939</a>, Zhao Guangyi, pointing out that there had not been any emissaries sent between Southern Han and Chu after Empress Ma's death and that the two states, related by marriage, should be friendly to each other, recommended the official Li Shu (&lt;U+674E&gt;&lt;U+7D13&gt;) as an appropriate emissary. Liu Yan agreed, and after Li visited Chu, Chu also sent emissaries to Southern Han, reestablishing relations between the two states. Despite this, in <a href="941" class="uri" title="wikilink">941</a>, Liu Yan sent an emissary to <a href="Later_Jin_Dynasty_(Five_Dynasties)" title="wikilink">Later Jin</a>'s <a href="Emperor_Gaozu_of_Later_Jin" title="wikilink">Emperor Gaozu</a> (whose Later Jin state had earlier taken over Later Tang's territory) seeking a military alliance where they would attack Chu and divide its territory; the Later Jin emperor declined.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="942" class="uri" title="wikilink">942</a>, Liu Yan grew seriously ill. He considered both of his oldest surviving sons, Liu Hongdu and <a href="Liu_Sheng_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Liu Hongxi</a> the Prince of Jin, to be arrogant and unrestrained, and considered a younger son, Liu Hongchang (&lt;U+5289&gt;&lt;U+5F18&gt;&lt;U+660C&gt;) the Prince of Yue, to be an appropriate successor. He thus considered sending Liu Hongdu and Liu Hongxi out of the capital and making Liu Hongchang his heir. However, the official Xiao Yi (&lt;U+856D&gt;&lt;U+76CA&gt;) persuaded him that bypassing older sons would cause disturbances, and so Liu Yan did not carry out this plan. He soon died, and Liu Hongdu became emperor (as Emperor Shang).<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
