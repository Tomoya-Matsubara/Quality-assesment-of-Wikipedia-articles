<p><strong>Jean-Baptiste Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt;</strong> (1780 â€“ February 27, 1847) was a career officer and general in the Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian Army. He was made President of <a href="Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti</a> on March 1, 1846.</p>
<p>Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; was born free, the son of a prominent free black man of the same name in the North Province of <a href="Saint-Domingue" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Domingue</a> (the French colony that later became Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti). His father was a sergeant in the colonial militia and probably served in the rebel forces. Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; himself joined the <a href="Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian_Revolution" title="wikilink">Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian Revolutionaries</a> probably some time in 1801. After Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti gained independence at the end of the revolution in 1803, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; joined the forces of <a href="Henri_Christophe" title="wikilink">Henri Christophe</a>, who in 1807 promoted him to the rank of general and deputy commander of his army. During the civil war that followed between <a href="Alexandre_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tion" title="wikilink">Alexandre P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tion</a> and Christophe, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; was instrumental in Christophe's victory at the <a href="Battle_of_Siebert" title="wikilink">Battle of Siebert</a> on January 1, 1807. During the siege of <a href="Port-au-Prince" class="uri" title="wikilink">Port-au-Prince</a> in 1811, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; commanded the left wing of Christophe's army. A loyal officer, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; quickly became one of Christophe's most trusted commanders, and as a consequence he was placed in command of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti's Northern Province, where he was effective in subduing the <a href="mulatto" class="uri" title="wikilink">mulatto</a> population.</p>
<p>After Christophe's downfall in 1820, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; supported the new government and was therefore able to retain his post during the subsequent administration of <a href="Jean_Pierre_Boyer" title="wikilink">Jean Pierre Boyer</a>, and those that followed. This continued until <a href="Jean-Louis_Pierrot" title="wikilink">Jean-Louis Pierrot</a> became <a href="President_of_Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti" title="wikilink">President of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti</a> in 1845. Pierrot attempted to reform the Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian government, causing the Boyerist hierarchy of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti to sponsor a rebellion in the provinces of Port-au-Prince and <a href="Artibonite_Department" title="wikilink">Artibonite</a> in 1846. The rebel army under mulatto control proclaimed Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; president of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti on March 1, 1846. After much of the Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian army sided with the rebels, President Pierrot relinquished his office on March 24, 1846. After gaining the presidency of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti, one of Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s first acts was to restore the <a href="Constitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constitution</a> of 1816.</p>
<p>As president, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; was considered a failure by his Boyerist backers. Originally intended to be a figurehead, Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt; quickly began to take an active role. He soon proposed reforms similar to those espoused by former President Pierrot. Probably as a result of these proposals he died on February 27, 1847, possibly from being poisoned, although this has never been established. Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s presidency, considered ineffective by historians, opened the way for considerable changes in the political landscape of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;ti during the succeeding administrations. As a result, his presidency can be considered a turning point in the history of Ha&lt;U+00EF&gt;tian politics.</p>
<p>After Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s death in 1847, he was replaced by Faustin-&lt;U+00C9&gt;lie Soulouque, who was anticipated to be similar to Rich&lt;U+00E9&gt;. Soulouque later appointed himself Emperor <a href="Faustin_I" title="wikilink">Faustin I</a>.</p>
