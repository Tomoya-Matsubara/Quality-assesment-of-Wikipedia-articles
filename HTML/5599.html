" alt="Zephyr and Hyakinthos: Greek mythology is a source for much modern speculative fiction, and often features homosexuality. " width="200" /> <strong>Homosexuality in speculative fiction</strong> refers to the incorporation of gay themes into <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> or <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> fiction. Such elements may include an <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> character as the protagonist or a major character, or explore the varieties of <a href="human_sexual_behavior" title="wikilink">sexual experience</a> that deviate from the conventional.</p>
<p>As genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem even more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterization and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also to promise more freedom than do non-genre literatures to imagine alternatives to the privileged assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that suffuse many cultures.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic <a href="Darko_Suvin" title="wikilink">Darko Suvin</a> has called, &quot;cognitive estrangement,&quot; the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose change forces us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her <a href="heteronormative" class="uri" title="wikilink">heteronormative</a> cultural assumptions. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures, such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of science fiction and fantasy. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. In such a context, writers like <a href="Edgar_Pangborn" title="wikilink">Edgar Pangborn</a> who featured passionate male friendships in their work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much.</p>
<p>As the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a decadent slaveholding lordling whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villians.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early science fiction novel <em><a href="Odd_John" title="wikilink">Odd John</a></em> (1935), by <a href="Olaf_Stapledon" title="wikilink">Olaf Stapledon</a>. John is a <a href="mutant" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutant</a> with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he has consensual <a href="intercourse" class="uri" title="wikilink">intercourse</a> with his mother Pax and that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.</p>

<p>As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like <a href="Philip_Jose_Farmer" title="wikilink">Philip Jose Farmer</a> and <a href="Theodore_Sturgeon" title="wikilink">Theodore Sturgeon</a> were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. <a href="Theodore_Sturgeon" title="wikilink">Sturgeon</a> wrote many stories during the <a href="Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction" title="wikilink">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a> that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story <em><a href="The_World_Well_Lost" title="wikilink">The World Well Lost</a></em> (1953), first published in <em>Universe</em> magazine and collected in <em><a href="A_Saucer_of_Loneliness" title="wikilink">A Saucer of Loneliness</a></em>, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the <em>Universe</em> cover was &quot;[His] most daring story&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>; Its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time.</p>
<p>Sturgeon would later write <em>Affair with a Green Monkey</em>, which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published <em><a href="Venus_Plus_X" title="wikilink">Venus Plus X</a></em>, in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Although not usually identified as a genre writer like Sturgeon, <a href="William_S._Burroughs" title="wikilink">William S. Burroughs</a> in 1959 published <em><a href="Naked_Lunch" title="wikilink">Naked Lunch</a></em>, the first of many works such as <em><a href="The_Nova_Trilogy" title="wikilink">The Nova Trilogy</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Wild_Boys_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Wild Boys</a></em> in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities. The result was a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do.</p>
<p>Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles with Sturgeon's tolerance for the alternative or Burroughs's intolerance for the ordinary. Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in <a href="Charles_Beaumont" title="wikilink">Charles Beaumont</a>'s short story <em>The Crooked Man</em> (1955), first published in <a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a> inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress their heterosexual minority. In <a href="Anthony_Burgess" title="wikilink">Anthony Burgess</a>&lt;U+2019&gt; <em><a href="The_Wanting_Seed" title="wikilink">The Wanting Seed</a></em> (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment, part of an unnatural state of affairs along with by failing of the natural world and violent warfare.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="homosexuality-during-the-new-wave-era-1960-70s">Homosexuality during the New Wave era (1960-70s)</h3>
<p>By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called &quot;the <a href="New_Wave_(science_fiction)" title="wikilink">new wave</a>,&quot; a movement more skeptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in &quot;inner space&quot; instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Notable openly gay male authors included <a href="Thomas_M._Disch" title="wikilink">Thomas M. Disch</a> and <a href="Samuel_R._Delany" title="wikilink">Samuel R. Delany</a>. Under the influence of New wave editors and authors such as <a href="Michael_Moorcock" title="wikilink">Michael Moorcock</a> (editor of the influential New Worlds) and <a href="Ursula_K._Le_Guin" title="wikilink">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy. <a href="Joanna_Russ" title="wikilink">Joanna Russ</a>'s <em><a href="The_Female_Man" title="wikilink">The Female Man</a></em> (1975) and the award winning story <em><a href="When_It_Changed" title="wikilink">When It Changed</a></em>, showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, was also enourmously influential. <img src="dhalgren_vintage.jpg" title="fig:Dhalgren Vintage edition book cover" alt="Dhalgren Vintage edition book cover" width="150" /></p>
<p>In the earliest stories of <a href="Samuel_R._Delany" title="wikilink">Samuel R. Delany</a>, the gay sexual aspect appears as a &quot;sensibility&quot;, rather than in overt sexual references. <em><a href="Nova_(novel)" title="wikilink">Nova</a></em> (1968) is the first major science fiction novel with a gay male protagonist, nominated for a Hugo award and listed by critic <a href="David_Pringle" title="wikilink">David Pringle</a> as one of the 100 best SF novel from 1949 to 1984.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In some stories, such as <em><a href="Babel-17" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babel-17</a></em> (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because one character is a woman who is involved in a three-person <a href="marriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">marriage</a>, the other two members of which are males. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In later works, Delany blurs the line between science fiction and gay pornography.</p>
<p><a href="Nebula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nebula</a>-winning short story <em><a href="Aye,_and_Gomorrah" title="wikilink">Aye, and Gomorrah</a></em>, which posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award winning stories featuring gay characters, such as <em><a href="Time_Considered_as_a_Helix_of_Semi-Precious_Stones" title="wikilink">Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones</a></em> were to follow (all collected in Delany's short story retrospective <em><a href="Aye,_and_Gomorrah,_and_other_stories" title="wikilink">Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories</a></em>).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In his most famous science fiction novel entitled <em><a href="Dhalgren" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dhalgren</a></em> (1975), Delany spots his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Once again, sex activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF. Delany depicts, mostly with affection, characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviors, not, it would seem, with the intent of a kind of covert advocacy but with the effect of revealing to the reader the fact that these kinds of people exist in the real world.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="Time_Enough_for_Love" title="wikilink">Time Enough for Love</a></em> by <a href="Robert_A._Heinlein" title="wikilink">Robert A. Heinlein</a> (1973), the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex. <a href="Ursula_K._Le_Guin" title="wikilink">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> explored trans-<a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> sexuality in <em><a href="The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness" title="wikilink">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em> (1969), the sexuality of species in which individuals are neither &quot;male&quot; nor &quot;female&quot; but normally have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities. Le Guin has subsequently written many stories that examine the posibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality, such as the sexual bonding between clones in <a href="Nine_Lives_(novelette)" title="wikilink">Nine Lives</a> (collected in <a href="The_Wind&#39;s_Twelve_Quarters" title="wikilink">The Wind's Twelve Quarters</a>).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Elizabeth_A._Lynn" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Lynn</a>'s <em>Chronicles of Tornor</em> novels (1979-80), the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background.</p>
<h3 id="modern-gay-sf-post-new-wave">Modern Gay SF (Post New Wave)</h3>
<p>After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> such as <a href="David_Gerrold" title="wikilink">David Gerrold</a> and <a href="Geoff_Ryman" title="wikilink">Geoff Ryman</a>.

<p>In 2006 <a href="DC_Comics" title="wikilink">DC Comics</a> could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character <a href="Batwoman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batwoman</a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> even while openly lesbian characters such as <a href="Gotham_City" title="wikilink">Gotham City</a> police officer <a href="Renee_Montoya" title="wikilink">Renee Montoya</a> already existed in DC Comics.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>. Previously, <a href="WildStorm" class="uri" title="wikilink">WildStorm</a>'s <a href="Image_Comics" title="wikilink">Image Comics</a> had featured <a href="Sarah_Rainmaker" title="wikilink">Sarah Rainmaker</a> of <a href="Gen&lt;U+00B9&gt;&lt;U+00B3&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gen&lt;U+00B9&gt;&lt;U+00B3&gt;</a> as a character with an interest in other women, and had openly depicted homosexual relationships between the members of <a href="The_Authority" title="wikilink">the Authority</a>, such as <a href="Jenny_Sparks" title="wikilink">Jenny Sparks</a> and <a href="Swift_(comics)" title="wikilink">Swift</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="yaoi-and-yuri-manga">Yaoi and Yuri manga</h4>
<p><img src="InnocentBirdManga6.jpg" title="fig:Innocent Bird: Volume 2 USA Cover" alt="Innocent Bird: Volume 2 USA Cover" width="160" />  </p>
<p><a href="Yaoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yaoi</a> (&lt;U+3084&gt;&lt;U+304A&gt;&lt;U+3044&gt;) is a publishing genre which focuses on male/male relationships and is marketed at females. Anal sex is uniquitous. The genre originated in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> and encompasses <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a>, <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a>, novels and <a href="d&lt;U+014D&gt;jinshi" class="uri" title="wikilink">d&lt;U+014D&gt;jinshi</a>. In Japan, this genre is called &quot;<em>Boys' Love</em>&quot; and <a href="yaoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">yaoi</a> as a genre name is mostly used by western fans.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Yaoi has spread beyond Japan; yaoi material is available in the United States, as well as other Western and Eastern nations worldwide. As with much manga and anime, SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common. For example <em><a href="Innocent_Bird" title="wikilink">Innocent Bird</a></em> is a manga in which the main charcters are angels and demons. <a href="Ai_no_Kusabi" title="wikilink">Ai no Kusabi</a> is a 1980s yaoi light novel series involving a science fictional caste system. The characters of yaoi do not tend to self-identify as gay.</p>
<p>There is also &quot;gay manga&quot; specifically targeted at gay men, with gay characters. Yaoi writers and fans distinguish these &quot;gay manga&quot; as being separate from yaoi.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The female (hence lesbian) counterpart of Yaoi is called <a href="Yuri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yuri</a>. <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <em>Yuri</em> can focus either on the sexual or the emotional aspects of the relationship, the latter sometimes being called <em>sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo-ai</em> by western fans.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Although yuri originated in female-targeted works, today it is featured in male-targeted ones as well.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sf-television-and-film">SF television and film</h2>
<p>In general, SF on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major SF franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual and transgendered (LGBT) relationships are more rare. The platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as <a href="slash_fiction" title="wikilink">slash fiction</a> - <a href="Kirk/Spock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kirk/Spock</a> being the earliest example.</p>
<h4 id="star-trek">Star Trek</h4>

<p>The <a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a> franchise's lack of same-sex relationship has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> who point out that <a href="Gene_Roddenberry" title="wikilink">Gene Roddenberry</a> had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in <em>Star Trek</em>, but that the franchises coverage has remained meagre.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Homosexuality has occasionally been treated as an &quot;issue&quot; within the new Star Trek franchises, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a> <a href="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="wikilink">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> episode &quot;<a href="The_Outcast" title="wikilink">The Outcast</a>,&quot; and the <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="Rejoined" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rejoined</a>,&quot; which was the first to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil &quot;mirror universe&quot; (&quot;<a href="The_Emperor&#39;s_New_Cloak" title="wikilink">The Emperor's New Cloak</a>&quot;) or body possession (&quot;<a href="Warlord" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warlord</a>&quot; and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters.</p>
<p>In a <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> ''Fandom ''interview, Star Trek screenwriter <a href="Ronald_D._Moore" title="wikilink">Ronald D. Moore</a> suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels, which are officially licensed but not considered <a href="canon_(fiction)" title="wikilink">canon</a>, have featured serious direct (not alternate-universe, not due to body possession, etc.) same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character (Lieutenant Hawk from <em><a href="Star_Trek:_First_Contact" title="wikilink">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em>) as gay.</p>
<h4 id="torchwood">Torchwood</h4>

<p>Torchwood is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running <a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a> franchise, which began airing in 2006 on <a href="BBC_Three" title="wikilink">BBC Three</a>.</p>
<p>Torchwood explores several themes in its <a href="narrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrative</a>, in particular <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines <a href="homosexuality" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> and <a href="bisexuality" title="wikilink">bisexual</a> relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation.</p>
