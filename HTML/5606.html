First established in New York City under the leadership of the Rev. <a href="John_Henry_Livingston" title="wikilink">John Henry Livingston</a>, who instructed aspiring ministers in his home, the seminary established its presence in New Brunswick in 1810. Although a separate institution, the seminary's early development in New Brunswick was closely connected with that of <a href="Rutgers_University" title="wikilink">Rutgers University</a> (formerly Queen's College and Rutgers College) before establishing its own campus in the city in 1856.

It also offers certificates and training programs to lay church leaders seeking advanced courses in Theology, Bible studies, Church History, and Servant Leadership. While rooted in the <a href="Calvinism" title="wikilink">Reformed faith</a>, New Brunswick Theological Seminary is dedicated to providing a comprehensive Christian education as &quot;an inter-cultural, ecumenical school of Christian faith, learning, and scholarship committed to its metro-urban and global contexts.&quot; As of the fall semester of 2012, the seminary enrolled 197 students.</p>

Dr. John Henry Livingston (1746&lt;U+2013&gt;1825) (pictured) initially offered theological instruction to students at his home." /> The Dutch Reformed Synod of New York recognized that there was a shortage of adequately trained ministers to supply the church&lt;U+2019&gt;s congregations in the British American colonies. Young men had to journey to the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> to pursue several years of theological studies at a Dutch university.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Church leaders sought to obtain the right to examine and ordain ministers in the colonies (later in the United States), and to operate a school to train them.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1766, several clergymen secured a charter from <a href="List_of_colonial_governors_of_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey's Royal Governor</a> <a href="William_Franklin" title="wikilink">William Franklin</a> for the creation of Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College, now <a href="Rutgers_University" title="wikilink">Rutgers University</a>, in New Brunswick, New Jersey &quot;for the education of youth in the learned languages, liberal and useful arts and sciences, and especially in divinity; preparing them for the ministry and other good offices.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>However, in these early years, the trustees of Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College and the Synod of New York disagreed on the purpose of the new institution. With uncertainty about the college's financial stability, the Synod desired to directly oversee the theological training of their ministerial candidates. However, the question of whether to open a seminary was delayed because of the ongoing hostilities of the American Revolution.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> After the war concluded, the Synod decided in 1784 that it was necessary to support the study of theology and recommenced the effort to establish a seminary. The Rev. <a href="John_Henry_Livingston" title="wikilink">John Henry Livingston</a>, a graduate of both <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale College</a> (1762) in Connecticut and the <a href="University_of_Utrecht" title="wikilink">University of Utrecht</a> (1770) in the Netherlands, was appointed to be the Synod&lt;U+2019&gt;s Professor of Sacred Theology and to organize theological education at Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, when Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College did not provide Livingston a salary, he remained in New York overseeing a parish and instructing theology students in his home.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1792, the Synod became aware that many students were prevented from pursuing their studies in the &quot;commercial emporium of New York&quot; because of the high cost of living and a lack of sufficient funds. To address this difficulty, the Synod decided to locate the seminary outside of the city.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, as Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College had severe financial difficulties and was forced to close by 1795, New Brunswick was not considered a viable option. In 1796, Livingston was directed by the Synod to relocate his theological classes to a small school in Flatbush (now in <a href="Queens,_New_York" title="wikilink">Queens, New York</a>) where it remained for the next 14 years.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

Condict, the college's third president, and the college's trustees agreed to coordinate with the Synod on theological education, to hire professors, and establish a library.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1810, Condict declined the post of <a href="List_of_Rutgers_University_presidents" title="wikilink">president of Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College</a> in a full capacity (he had been serving in a <em>pro tempore</em> capacity since 1795), and the trustees of the college offered the post to Livingston who accepted. The seminary was relocated to New Brunswick.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The college closed again in 1816, but the trustees permitted the theological seminary to remain on the Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College campus and expressed hope that the college would be revived.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> At this time, the Rev. <a href="Elias_van_Bunschooten" title="wikilink">Elias van Bunschooten</a>, a <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton-trained</a> minister residing in <a href="Sussex_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Sussex County, New Jersey</a>, established funded a trust for assisting indigent young men in pursuing their studies preparing for ministry.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1823, the Synod paid a significant portion of Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s College&lt;U+2019&gt;s debts in order to place the institution on a secure financial footing and enable it to reopen. With the second reopening, the Synod provided clergymen to serve at the college as theology professors. Livingston had dedicated several years to raising money for the effort but died shortly before Queen's College reopened in 1825. The Rev. <a href="Philip_Milledoler" title="wikilink">Philip Milledoler</a>, a Reformed clergyman from New York City, was appointed to fill the vacancy created by Livingston's death. Milledoler persuaded one of his parishioners, Colonel <a href="Henry_Rutgers" title="wikilink">Henry Rutgers</a> (1745&lt;U+2013&gt;1830), to support the college. The trustees subsequently renamed it Rutgers College in his honour. At first, the Synod exercised oversight over the operations of the college, but by 1840 directed its attentions solely to the operation of the seminary.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During this period Rutgers College, the college&lt;U+2019&gt;s grammar school (now <a href="Rutgers_Preparatory_School" title="wikilink">Rutgers Preparatory School</a>), and the seminary shared one building, known as <a href="Old_Queens" title="wikilink">Old Queens</a> (built 1809-1823) until the two schools separated operations entirely in 1856.</p>
<p>According to Bruggink and Baker, in 1792 (seven years after Livingston began to teach in his home), there were 116 Reformed churches served by 40 ministers. In 1830, twenty years after starting instruction in New Brunswick and organizing the seminary, there were 159 ministers serving 194 churches.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>When the seminary's leaders proposed the idea, the Synod of New York removed financial support from both Rutgers and the seminary.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Colonel James Nielson, David Bishop, and Charles Dayton&lt;U+2014&gt;prominent citizens in New Brunswick&lt;U+2014&gt;donated plots of land totaling almost 8 acres (32,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) consisting of part of a hill extending from George Street to College Avenue. At the same time, Ann Hertzog of Philadelphia donated $30,000 for the construction of a building to be named &quot;Peter Hertzog Theological Hall&quot; in memory of her husband. Hertzog Hall (built 1855&lt;U+2013&gt;1856) became a dominant feature on the hill, which became known locally as &quot;Holy Hill&quot;. In November 1776, during the American Revolution, the hill was the site of a British artillery redoubt during the occupation of New Brunswick.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth century, the institution became known because of the efforts of missionaries serving throughout the world.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In the 1870s, the campus was expanded with the construction of two buildings&lt;U+2014&gt;one housing a gymnasium and additional lecture space; the second, a library. The seminary desired to build a library first, citing the need to house its expanding collection of books. However, local businessman and seminary benefactor James Suydam donated funds to build the gynasium, to be named Suydam Hall, because he was extremely concerned with student health.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Suydam Hall was built in 1873 and was designed by architect <a href="Henry_Janeway_Hardenbergh" title="wikilink">Henry Janeway Hardenbergh</a>.

<p>The Master of Arts (M.A.) program requires eighteen months to two years of full-time coursework and a offers degree concentrations in Biblical Studies, Pastoral Care, Historical and Constructive Theology, Church and Society. The program is intended for ministry candidates who do not require an M.Div., those who desire to enrich their studies, and for those looking to supplement a professional degree or prepare for a theological Ph.D. program.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) is a three-year program with a specialized focus toward Metro-Urban Ministry. It is a research degree that combines academic research and a focus on ministry or mission work through &quot;a theological understanding of the life and work of the church in urban communities.&quot; A D.Min. degree candidate has the option of two courses of study: one concerning the challenges of ministry in an ethnically-diverse urban environment; or the challenges of a &quot;Prisons, Public Policy, and Transformative Justice&quot; ministry. Students in both programs engage in coursework and research augmented by a collaboration between the seminary and Rutgers University&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Edward_J._Bloustein_School_of_Planning_and_Public_Policy" title="wikilink">Edward J.
