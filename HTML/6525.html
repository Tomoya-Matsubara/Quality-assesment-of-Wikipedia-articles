<p><strong>Geoffrey &quot;Geoff&quot; Smith</strong> (born 14 March 1928) is an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> former professional <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">footballer</a> who played 253 league games for <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a> as a <a href="Goalkeeper_(association_football)" title="wikilink">goalkeeper</a>, including 200 consecutive appearances. When he retired, he held club records for the number of <a href="shutout#Association_football" title="wikilink">clean sheets</a> in a season and total clean sheets.</p>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="Cottingley,_Bradford" title="wikilink">Cottingley, Bradford</a>, moved to nearby <a href="Keighley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keighley</a> with his family before serving in <a href="Malayan_Union" title="wikilink">Malaya</a> in the British Army at the end of his teens. His first trial at Bradford City was unsuccessful but after playing amateur football for <a href="Lancashire_Combination" title="wikilink">Lancashire Combination League</a> sides <a href="Nelson_F.C." title="wikilink">Nelson</a> and <a href="Rossendale_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Rossendale United</a>, he was signed by Bradford's new manager <a href="Ivor_Powell" title="wikilink">Ivor Powell</a> in 1952. He was at Bradford City for seven seasons and played in every league game between the final match of the <a href="1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54 season</a> and October 1958. He eventually retired in 1959. After his football career, Smith and his wife ran two different off-licences for the remainder of their working life.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="Cottingley,_Bradford" title="wikilink">Cottingley</a> on the outskirts of <a href="Bradford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bradford</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, on 14 March 1928. He had a brother Jack<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and during their childhood, the Smith family moved to <a href="Keighley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keighley</a>, where Smith first played <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> for St Anne's Church. At the age of 18, Smith was called up to the army. He served in an infantry unit in <a href="Malayan_Union" title="wikilink">Malaya</a> for two years before he returned to Keighley.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<p>Smith resumed his football career back at home with Keighley Central Club. A <a href="Goalkeeper_(association_football)" title="wikilink">goalkeeper</a>, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local <a href="Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> side <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a>, who were at the time in the <a href="Football_League_Third_Division_North" title="wikilink">Third Division North</a>. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Instead, Smith joined <a href="Lancashire_Combination" title="wikilink">Lancashire Combination League</a> side <a href="Nelson_F.C." title="wikilink">Nelson</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for <a href="Leeds_United_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Leeds United</a> but had been released when <a href="Frank_Buckley_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Major Frank Buckley</a> took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Smith played for Nelson for three years<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> at a time when the club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed <a href="Rossendale_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Rossendale United</a>, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bradford-city">Bradford City</h3>
<p>In December 1952, on the advice of Smith's friend Roy Brook, who was in Bradford's second team, new Bradford City manager <a href="Ivor_Powell" title="wikilink">Ivor Powell</a> invited Smith back to City for another trial and he played for the reserves against <a href="Gainsborough_Trinity_F.C." title="wikilink">Gainsborough Trinity</a> and <a href="Notts_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Notts County</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This time, Smith's trial was successful and Bradford City &lt;U+2013&gt; still a Third Division North side &lt;U+2013&gt; signed him on amateur forms.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Smith had played only seven games for the reserves in the <a href="Midland_Football_League" title="wikilink">Midland League</a> and was still unpaid when he was given his first-team debut against <a href="Scunthorpe_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Scunthorpe United</a> on 17 January 1953 coming into the side for <a href="Brendan_McManus" title="wikilink">Brendan McManus</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> whom Smith said was &quot;having a rough time&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It was not a good start for Smith, with City losing 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0, but he followed this with a <a href="shutout#Association_football" title="wikilink">clean sheet</a> in his second game against <a href="Stockport_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Stockport County</a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and kept his place in the side for the remainder of the season, playing 19 games, before he signed part-time professional terms in July 1953.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He had previously worked part-time as a lorry driver, earning &lt;U+00A3&gt;4 10s (&lt;U+00A3&gt;4.50) working 48 hours per week as a lorry driver, but the club did not want him driving around the country and offered him &lt;U+00A3&gt;10 per week plus a &lt;U+00A3&gt;4 win bonus. To supplement his playing contract, the club gave Smith a job looking after their <a href="Valley_Parade" title="wikilink">Valley Parade</a> ground.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>During the mid-season break, McManus left City to join <a href="Frickley_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Frickley Athletic</a>. Instead, Powell signed <a href="Jimmy_Gooch" title="wikilink">Jimmy Gooch</a> from <a href="Preston_North_End_F.C." title="wikilink">Preston North End</a> as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, was more experienced than Smith and so took over as first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the <a href="1953-54_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54 season</a> playing the first 20 games.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw with <a href="Hartlepool_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Hartlepools United</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against <a href="Gateshead_F.C." title="wikilink">Gateshead</a> as City finished fifth.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> during which they conceded just one goal.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Gooch left City after just one season to join <a href="Watford_F.C." title="wikilink">Watford</a> leaving Smith to take over the &quot;number one&quot; shirt.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> For the next four seasons, Smith, who became a full-time professional, played every single first-team game for City which eventually led to him making 200 consecutive league appearances<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; it was a run that coincided with one of 246 league and <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a> games by <a href="defender_(football)#Full_back" title="wikilink">full back</a> <a href="George_Mulholland_(footballer)" title="wikilink">George Mulholland</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> However, for three seasons, City could not match the fifth place gained in 1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54 and they remained a Third Division North side.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1957&lt;U+2013&gt;58, under Powell's replacement as manager <a href="Peter_Jackson_(footballer_born_1905)" title="wikilink">Peter Jackson</a>, City finished in third place but missed out on the title by nine points to Scunthorpe United.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> During the season, Smith set a new club record of 18 clean sheets, one which was later equalled by <a href="Steve_Smith_(footballer_born_1957)" title="wikilink">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="Eric_McManus" title="wikilink">Eric McManus</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The following season, Smith's run of consecutive games came to an end against <a href="Reading_F.C." title="wikilink">Reading</a> in October 1958,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and <a href="Charlie_Bicknell" title="wikilink">Charlie Bicknell</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He played 26 further games in the <a href="1958&lt;U+2013&gt;59_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1958&lt;U+2013&gt;59 season</a>,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Third Division</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His last game was a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> keeping a club record 70 clean sheets.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> His record stood until it was broken by <a href="Paul_Tomlinson" title="wikilink">Paul Tomlinson</a> in the 1990s.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a <a href="Benefit_(sports)" title="wikilink">benefit match</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
