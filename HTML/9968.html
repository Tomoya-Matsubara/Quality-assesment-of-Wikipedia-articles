<p>In the 1960s, Franks helped to <a href="integration" title="wikilink">integrate</a> Grand Rapids. In the early 1960s, African Americans were not welcome in Grand Rapids' &quot;white&quot; <a href="middle-class" class="uri" title="wikilink">middle-class</a> neighborhoods, and <a href="real_estate_broker" title="wikilink">real estate agents</a> would not show them houses. In 1962, Franks' friend, J.E. Adams, found vacant land designated as a potential park site. Adams, Franks, and friends Joesph Lee and Samuel Triplett created a plan to purchase the  site and build a middle-class neighborhood for African-Americans. The announcement &quot;caused an uproar that resulted in protests, lawsuits and threats.&quot; When banks refused to finance the project, the four men purchased the land on their own for <a href="U.S._Dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>60,000 and started building. The first of 51 houses was completed in 1965. Today, the neighborhood, known as Auburn Hills (not to be confused with ), has a population of 542 and the lowest crime rate in Grand Rapids.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 2006, the Michigan Alumni Club gave Franks the &quot;Paul G.
