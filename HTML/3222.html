In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both <a href="Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">track and field</a> and football, was named <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>'s track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same <a href="academic_year" title="wikilink">academic year</a>, and earned <a href="All-America" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-America</a> track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation from high school as one of Michigan's best athletes, he attended the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> on an <a href="athletic_scholarship" title="wikilink">athletic scholarship</a> and earned first-team All-<a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams.</p>
<p>At the University of Michigan, Wheatley earned the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year Award during the <a href="1992_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">1992 football season</a>. In the <a href="Michigan_Wolverines_football" title="wikilink">Michigan Wolverines</a>' post-season <a href="bowl_game" title="wikilink">bowl game</a>, he was named the <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> for his performance in the team's 1993 <a href="Rose_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl</a> victory. Wheatley continued his track success as well, earning first-team All-Big Ten Conference and All-American honors. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time <a href="Rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing</a> leaders in numerous categories, and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of six Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor track, one award for <a href="110_meter_hurdles" title="wikilink">110 meter hurdles</a>, and two awards for individual football statistical performances).</p>
<p>Following his graduation from the University of Michigan, Wheatley was selected by the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> in the first round of the <a href="1995_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">1995 NFL Draft</a>.

Despite his success on the field, he developed a reputation as a tardy <a href="WIKT:dawdle" title="wikilink">dawdler</a>. He was traded to the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a>, but cut before the <a href="1998_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1998 season</a> began. He signed with the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a> and flourished, leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL's top ten players by rushing <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a>. With Wheatley, the Raiders went to the playoffs three years in a row, including one <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a> appearance. During his NFL career (<a href="1995_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1995</a>–<a href="2004_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2004</a>), he totaled over 6,500 <a href="All-purpose_yardage" title="wikilink">all-purpose yards</a> as a <a href="running_back" title="wikilink">running back</a> and <a href="kickoff_returner" title="wikilink">kickoff returner</a>.</p>
<p>After retiring from the NFL, Wheatley returned to his hometown to coach his high school alma mater, <a href="Dearborn_Heights,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Dearborn Heights</a>' Hamilton J. Robichaud High School, where he had previously made a name for himself as a nine-time <a href="Michigan_High_School_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">Michigan High School Athletic Association</a> (MHSAA) state champion athlete. As a player, he had led the school to its only state football championship. In his first year as head football coach, his team rebounded from an 0–9 record to compile a 9–2 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1994. After a year of success coaching high school, he was hired in 2008 to serve as running backs coach for <a href="Team_Michigan" title="wikilink">Team Michigan</a> in the <a href="All_American_Football_League" title="wikilink">All American Football League</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Wheatley was born in , a city nicknamed &quot;Baby Saigon&quot; for its high crime rate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Inkster is located in <a href="Metro_Detroit" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Detroit</a>, east of both <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor</a> and the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>. Wheatley's father (also named Tyrone)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> suffered a mortal <a href="gunshot" class="uri" title="wikilink">gunshot</a> wound to the head in 1974 when Wheatley was two years old.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Wheatley's <a href="stepfather" class="uri" title="wikilink">stepfather</a> died of a heart attack when he was 13, leaving behind Wheatley, his sister, and half-brother, two-year-old Leslie Mongo.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shortly afterward, Wheatley's mother, Patricia,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> was <a href="layoff" title="wikilink">laid off</a> and became an <a href="alcoholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholic</a>. With the effective loss of his two parents, Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt, where he lived through the rest of his childhood.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Due to family difficulties, Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Mongo was ten years younger than Wheatley,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and graduated high school in New Jersey in 2004&lt;U+2014&gt;thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated high school.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Wheatley was involved in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age. Wheatley made it clear to his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo&lt;U+2014&gt;the youngest of his siblings&lt;U+2014&gt;in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to <a href="gang" class="uri" title="wikilink">gang</a> shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the  outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a <a href="letter_of_intent" title="wikilink">letter of intent</a> with the <a href="Utah_State_Aggies_football" title="wikilink">Utah State Aggies football</a> team as a <a href="defensive_back" title="wikilink">defensive back</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>By <a href="1998_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1998</a>, Wheatley was the only four-year veteran in the Giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator, he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The Giants fell to 8–8 while relying on Barber, Way and <a href="Gary_Brown" title="wikilink">Gary Brown</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> During the season, Wheatley often performed <a href="scout_team" title="wikilink">scout team</a> duties and was inactive for some games. Fassel was not sympathetic to Wheatley's desire for playing time and thought that Wheatley was overweight.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Over the course of the season, there was controversy about a season long weight limit of  that had been placed on Wheatley.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Wheatley's playing weight limit had been set at  in <a href="training_camp" title="wikilink">training camp</a> and had been raised to 235 on Wheatley's request.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> He had played at  in the final game of his college career.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> By week 11, Wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in New York although two different coaching staffs had issues with him. He points out <a href="double_standard" title="wikilink">double standards</a> that gave him bad feelings in retrospect. In situations where he was not the only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic, he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for <a href="Drunk_driving_(United_States)" title="wikilink">D.U.I.</a> were not vilified.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and thought he was the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00 a.m. team meetings.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Charles Way, by contrast, Wheatley's closest friend on the team and <a href="roommate" class="uri" title="wikilink">roommate</a> on the road, was nicknamed &quot;Teacher's Pet.&quot;<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a>, there was a misperception of Wheatley as a &quot;cancer&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> in the locker room by most accounts. Although he had some issues, his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The general opinion of Wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent, but as a package he was an enigma.
