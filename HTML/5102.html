<p>The <strong>Jeremiah Wright controversy</strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="political" class="uri" title="wikilink">political</a> issue that gained national attention in March 2008 when <a href="ABC_News" title="wikilink">ABC News</a>, after reviewing dozens of <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">U.S. 2008 Presidential Election</a> candidate <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>'s pastor <a href="Jeremiah_Wright" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Wright</a>'s sermons,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> excerpted parts which were subject to intense media scrutiny.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Wright is a retired senior pastor of <a href="Trinity_United_Church_of_Christ" title="wikilink">Trinity United Church of Christ</a> in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> and former pastor of <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> Barack Obama.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Obama denounced the statements in question, but after critics continued to press the issue of his relationship with Wright he gave a speech titled &quot;<a href="A_More_Perfect_Union_(speech)" title="wikilink">A More Perfect Union</a>,&quot; in which he sought to place Dr. Wright's comments in a historical and sociological context. In the speech, Obama again denounced Wright's remarks, but did not disown him as a person. The controversy began to fade, but was renewed in late April when Wright made a series of media appearances, including an interview on <a href="Bill_Moyers_Journal" title="wikilink">Bill Moyers Journal</a>, a speech at the <a href="NAACP" class="uri" title="wikilink">NAACP</a> and a speech at the <a href="National_Press_Club" title="wikilink">National Press Club</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After the last of these, Obama spoke more forcefully against his former pastor, saying that he was &quot;outraged&quot; and &quot;saddened&quot; by his behavior, and in May he resigned his membership in the church.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> first met Wright in the late 1980s, while he was working as a <a href="community_organizer" title="wikilink">community organizer</a> in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> before attending <a href="Harvard_Law_School" title="wikilink">Harvard Law School</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Wright officiated at the wedding ceremony of Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as their children's <a href="baptism" title="wikilink">baptisms</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The title of Obama's 2006 memoir, <em><a href="The_Audacity_of_Hope" title="wikilink">The Audacity of Hope</a></em>, was inspired by one of Wright's sermons, which was also a theme of Obama's 2004 <a href="2004_Democratic_National_Convention_keynote_address" title="wikilink">keynote address</a> to the Democratic National Convention.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Wright served as both a role model and a spiritual mentor for Obama, and the senator would check with Wright prior to making any bold political moves.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to the Reverend <a href="Jim_Wallis" title="wikilink">Jim Wallis</a>, who is a leader of the religious left, &quot;If you want to understand where Barack gets his feeling and rhetoric from, just look at Jeremiah Wright.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Wright was scheduled to give the public <a href="invocation" class="uri" title="wikilink">invocation</a> before Obama's presidential announcement, but Obama withdrew the invitation the night before the event.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Wright wrote a rebuttal letter to the editor disputing the characterization of the account as reported in an article in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, Wright was appointed to Barack Obama's African American Religious Leadership Committee, a group of over 170 national black religious leaders who supported Obama's bid for the Democratic nomination.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, it was announced in March 2008 that Wright was no longer serving as a member of this group.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversial-sermon-excerpts">Controversial sermon excerpts</h2>
<p>Most of the controversial excerpts that gained national attention in March 2008 were taken from two sermons: one titled &lt;U+201C&gt;The Day of Jerusalem&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fall&lt;U+201D&gt; delivered on <a href="September_16" title="wikilink">September 16</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> and another, titled &quot;Confusing God and Government&quot;, delivered on <a href="April_13" title="wikilink">April 13</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>.</p>
<h3 id="u201cthe-day-of-jerusalemu2019s-fallu201d">&lt;U+201C&gt;The Day of Jerusalem&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fall&lt;U+201D&gt;</h3>
<p>In a sermon delivered shortly after the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001, Wright made comments about an interview of former U.S. Ambassador <a href="Edward_Peck" title="wikilink">Edward Peck</a> he saw on <a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a>. Wright said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I heard Ambassador Peck on an interview yesterday. Did anybody else see him or hear him? He was on Fox News. This is a white man, and he was upsetting the Fox News commentators to no end. He pointed out &lt;U+2014&gt; did you see him, John? &lt;U+2014&gt; a white man, he pointed out, ambassador, that what Malcolm X said when he got silenced by Elijah Muhammad was in fact true &lt;U+2014&gt; America's chickens are coming home to roost.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wright spoke of the United States <a href="Trail_of_Tears" title="wikilink">taking land from the Indian tribes</a> by what he labeled as terror, bombing <a href="Grenada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grenada</a>, <a href="Panama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panama</a>, <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a>, <a href="Hiroshima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiroshima</a>, and <a href="Nagasaki,_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">Nagasaki</a>, and argued that the <a href="Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States supported state terrorism</a> against the <a href="Palestinian_people" title="wikilink">Palestinians</a> and South Africa. He said that his parishioners' response should be to examine their relationship with God, not go &quot;from the hatred of armed enemies to the hatred of unarmed innocents.&quot; His comment (quoting <a href="Malcolm_X" title="wikilink">Malcolm X</a>) that &quot;America's chickens are coming home to roost&quot; was widely interpreted as meaning that America had brought the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> upon itself.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="ABC_News" title="wikilink">ABC News</a> broadcast clips<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> from the sermon<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> in which Wright said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We bombed Hiroshima, we bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye... and now we are indignant, because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, Wright continued :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Violence begets violence. Hatred begets hatred. And terrorism begets terrorism. A white ambassador said that y'all, not a black militant. Not a reverend who preaches about racism. An ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised. The ambassador said the people that we have wounded don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have the military capability we have. But they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them. And we need to come to grips with that.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="u201cconfusing-god-and-governmentu201d">&lt;U+201C&gt;Confusing God and Government&lt;U+201D&gt;</h3>
<p>Clips from a sermon that Wright gave, entitled &lt;U+201C&gt;Confusing God and Government&lt;U+201D&gt;, were also shown on <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <em><a href="Good_Morning_America" title="wikilink">Good Morning America</a></em><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and <a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a>. In the sermon, Wright first makes the distinction between God and governments, and points out that many governments in the past have failed: &quot;Where governments lie, God does not lie. Where governments change, God does not change.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Wright then states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;[The United States] government lied about their belief that all men were created equal. The truth is they believed that all white men were created equal. The truth is they did not even believe that white women were created equal, in creation nor civilization. The government had to pass an amendment to the Constitution to get white women the vote. Then the government had to pass an equal rights amendment to get equal protection under the law for women. The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body, and between Uncle Clarence who sexually harassed Anita Hill, and a closeted Klan court, that is a throwback to the 19th century, handpicked by Daddy Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, between Clarence and that stacked court, they are about to undo Roe vs. Wade, just like they are about to un-do affirmative action. The government lied in its founding documents and the government is still lying today. Governments lie.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;The government lied about Pearl Harbor too. They knew the Japanese were going to attack. Governments lie. The government lied about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. They wanted that resolution to get us in the Vietnam War. Governments lie. The government lied about Nelson Mandela and our CIA helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years. The South African government lied on Nelson Mandela. Governments lie.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wright then stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The government lied about the <a href="Tuskegee_Study_of_Untreated_Syphilis_in_the_Negro_Male" title="wikilink">Tuskegee experiment</a>. They purposely infected African American men with syphilis. Governments lie. The government lied about bombing Cambodia and Richard Nixon stood in front of the camera, &lt;U+2018&gt;Let me make myself perfectly clear&lt;U+2026&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt; Governments lie. The government lied about the drugs for arms Contra scheme orchestrated by Oliver North, and then the government pardoned all the perpetrators so they could get better jobs in the government. Governments lie.... The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color. Governments lie. The government lied about a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and a connection between 9.11.01 and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Governments lie.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He spoke about the government's <a href="rationale_for_the_Iraq_War" title="wikilink">rationale for the Iraq War</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;The government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq being a threat to the United States peace. And guess what else? If they don&lt;U+2019&gt;t find them some weapons of mass destruction, they gonna do just like the <a href="Los_Angeles_Police_Department#Controversy" title="wikilink">LAPD</a>, and plant the some weapons of mass destruction. Governments lie.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wright then commented on God and government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the United States of America government, when it came to treating her citizens of Indian descent fairly, she failed. She put them on reservations. When it came to treating her citizens of Japanese descent fairly, she failed. She put them in internment prison camps. When it came to treating her citizens of African descent fairly, America failed. She put them in chains, the government put them on slave quarters, put them on auction blocks, put them in cotton field, put them in inferior schools, put them in substandard housing, put them in scientific experiments, put them in the lowest paying jobs, put them outside the equal protection of the law, kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness. The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America.' No, no, no, not God Bless America. God damn America &lt;U+2014&gt; that's in the Bible &lt;U+2014&gt; for killing innocent people. God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent..&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reaction">Reaction</h2>
<h3 id="barack-obama">Barack Obama</h3>
<p>When Wright's comments were aired in the national media, Obama distanced himself from them, saying to <a href="Charles_Gibson" title="wikilink">Charles Gibson</a> of ABC News, &quot;It's as if we took the five dumbest things that I've ever said or you've ever said in our lives and compressed them and put them out there &lt;U+2014&gt; I think that people's reaction would, understandably, be upset.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> At the same time, Obama stated that &quot;words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Obama later added, &quot;Had the reverend not retired, and had he not acknowledged that what he had said had deeply offended people and were inappropriate and mischaracterized what I believe is the greatness of this country, for all its flaws, then I wouldn't have felt as comfortable staying at the church.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Obama first denied that he had ever heard Pastor Wright's controversial comments before.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Illinois Senator later admitted, &quot;Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Obama said the remarks had come to his attention at the beginning of his presidential campaign but contended that because Wright was on the verge of retirement, and because of Obama's strong links to Trinity, he had not thought it appropriate to leave the church.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He began distancing himself from Wright when he called his pastor the night before the February 2007 announcement of Obama's presidential candidacy to withdraw his request that Wright deliver an invocation at the event. A spokesperson later said, &quot;Senator Obama is proud of his pastor and his church, but... decided to avoid having statements and beliefs being used out of context and forcing the entire church to defend itself.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Wright attended the announcement, prayed with Obama beforehand, and in December 2007 Obama named him to the African American Religious Leadership Committee of his campaign.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Obama campaign released Wright after the controversy.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Many critics found this response inadequate; <a href="Mark_Steyn" title="wikilink">Mark Steyn</a>, writing in the conservative publication <em><a href="National_Review" title="wikilink">National Review</a></em>, stated: &quot;Reverend Wright['s] appeals to racial bitterness are supposed to be everything President Obama will transcend. Right now, it sounds more like the same-old same-old.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>On March 18, in the wake of the controversy, Obama delivered a speech entitled &quot;<a href="A_More_Perfect_Union_(speech)" title="wikilink">A More Perfect Union</a>&quot; at the <a href="National_Constitution_Center" title="wikilink">National Constitution Center</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>. During the course of the 37-minute speech, Obama spoke of the divisions formed through generations through <a href="slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavery</a>, <a href="Racial_segregation" title="wikilink">segregation</a>, and <a href="Jim_Crow_laws" title="wikilink">Jim Crow laws</a>, and the reasons for the kinds of discussions and rhetoric used among blacks and whites in their own communities. While condemning the remarks by the pastor, he sought to place them in historical context by describing some of the key events that have formed Wright's views on race-related matters in America. Obama did not disown Wright, whom he has labeled as &quot;an old uncle&quot;, as akin to disowning the black community or disowning his white grandmother, <a href="Madelyn_Dunham" title="wikilink">Madelyn Dunham</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The speech was generally well received.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Obama said that some of the comments by his pastor reminded him of what he called America's &quot;tragic history when it comes to race.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

If his pastor went to Libya, Tripoli with <a href="Louis_Farrakhan" title="wikilink">Louis Farrakhan</a>, a virulent, anti-Semitic racist, his church gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan.

<p>Wright's church, <a href="Trinity_United_Church_of_Christ,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Trinity United Church of Christ</a>, criticized the media coverage of his past sermons, saying in a statement that Wright's &quot;character is being assassinated in the public sphere.... It is an indictment on Dr. Wright&lt;U+2019&gt;s ministerial legacy to present his global ministry within a 15- or 30-second sound bite.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Lara Cohen, news director at the <em><a href="Us_Weekly" title="wikilink">Us Weekly</a></em>, noted that her publication &quot;has been accused of distracting people from the 'Important Issues'&quot; because of its focus on <a href="Supermarket_tabloid" title="wikilink">Supermarket tabloid</a> concerns, and said that mainstream media &quot;talking heads love to tut-tut about how attention to celebrity gossip is causing the great dumbing-down of American society.&quot; She charged that, in light of the sensationalized coverage about Wright, mainstream media outlets no longer had grounds to make these criticisms of <em>Us Weekly</em>, and turned the charge back upon the mainstream media. Cohen state, &quot;The true hallmark of sensationalized journalism is ginning up controversy to drive sales, and for the mainstream news media Wright was a tailor-made tabloid icon. With newspaper sales at record lows, network news ratings tanking and 24-hour news channels desperate to fill up all 24 hours, Wright's outbursts were the mainstream media's equivalent of Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch—a train wreck no one could turn away from. And so they milked it, regardless of the impact on the very race they were supposedly covering objectively.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>Many academics commented on Wright, <a href="black_theology" title="wikilink">black theology</a>, and the concomitant political controversy within a broader context of American history and culture.</p>
<p>In 2004, prior to the Wright controversy, Anthony E. Cook, a professor of law at <a href="Georgetown_University" title="wikilink">Georgetown University</a>, provided a detailed comparative analysis of sermons delivered after 9-11 by <a href="Jerry_Falwell" title="wikilink">Jerry Falwell</a>, <a href="T.D._Jakes" title="wikilink">T.D.

Cook noted that the overall intent of Falwell's and Jakes's sermons was to use the Christian religion as a justification for the <a href="War_on_Terror" title="wikilink">War on Terror</a>, while Wright's overall intent was to side against war and to get listeners to engage in introspection about their daily behavior and relationship with God.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Martin E.

<p>Bill J.

There were also clips of his ministry and parishioners at various points in time since he became pastor in 1972, in an attempt to show what Trinity stands for and has accomplished. Wright stated that his comments were &quot;taken out of context&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> and that &quot;the persons who have heard the entire sermon understand the communication perfectly.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> He went on to say: &quot;When something is taken like a sound bite for a political purpose and put constantly over and over again, looped in the face of the public, that's not a failure to communicate.

<p>On <a href="April_27" title="wikilink">April 27</a>, Wright gave a keynote address at a fundraising dinner for the <a href="Detroit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>-chapter of the <a href="NAACP" class="uri" title="wikilink">NAACP</a>. In front of nearly 10,000, he discussed the controversy, saying, &quot;I am not running for the Oval Office,&quot; referring to what he perceived as Republican attempts to make the controversy part of the campaign.

<p>In his speech to the NAACP, Wright speculated that, &quot;Africans have a different meter, and Africans have a different tonality. Europeans have seven tones, Africans have five.

<h3 id="obamas-response">Obama's response</h3>
<p>Obama attempted to further distance himself from Wright, as he expressed outrage and shock at a press conference on April 29:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday... The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago. His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church. They certainly don&lt;U+2019&gt;t portray accurately my values and beliefs. And if Reverend Wright thinks that that&lt;U+2019&gt;s political posturing, as he put it, then he doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t know me very well. And based on his remarks yesterday, well, I may not know him as well as I thought either.... What became clear to me is that he was presenting a world view that contradicts who I am and what I stand for, and what I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing. Anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what I'm about knows that I am about trying to bridge gaps and I see the commonality in all people. ...[A]fter seeing Reverend Wright&lt;U+2019&gt;s performance, I felt as if there was a complete disregard for what the American people are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems. ...[W]hatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed, as a consequence of this.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

It's a legitimate concern, but if it didn't weigh him down too much after the Philadelphia speech in March, I wouldn't expect it to do him in this time. Wright's &quot;performance&quot; yesterday struck me as new and brazen enough to warrant a different reaction than Obama would have had in the past.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> <a href="Victor_Davis_Hanson" title="wikilink">Victor Davis Hanson</a> wrote, &quot;Obama, by what he wrote in his memoirs, by what he said when he spoke in his early campaign speeches, by his frequent praise of Wright, and by his 20-year presence in front of, and subsidies to, Wright knew exactly the racist and anti-American nature of his odious pastor.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> American <a href="linguist" class="uri" title="wikilink">linguist</a> and social commentator <a href="John_McWhorter" title="wikilink">John McWhorter</a> wrote, &quot;now that the Reverend Wright has gone on tour and given us full doses of these professionally alienated postures from another time, it is good to see that Mr. Obama has had the courage to decisively break with him.

<p>At the end of March 2008, as over 40 states had already held their Democratic primary processes, Barack Obama built on his national <a href="Gallup" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallup</a> daily tracking poll results to become the first candidate to open a double-digit lead since Super Tuesday, when his competitor Hillary Clinton had a similar margin. On <a href="March_30" title="wikilink">March 30</a> the poll showed Obama at 52% and Clinton at 42%. The Rassmussen Reports poll, taken during the same time frame, showed an Obama advantage of five points.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> These polls followed weeks of heavy campaigning and heated rhetoric from both camps, and another late-March poll found Obama maintaining his positive rating and limiting his negative rating, better than his chief rival Clinton, even considering Obama's involvement in controversy during the period. The <a href="NBC_News" title="wikilink">NBC News</a> and <a href="Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">Wall Street Journal</a> poll showed Obama losing two points of positive rating and gaining four points of negative rating, while Clinton lost eight points of positive rating and gained five points of negative rating.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the revival of the controversy surrounding Wright in late April 2008, several polls showed that Obama's image among voters had suffered.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> According to a poll taken by the <a href="Gallup_Organization" title="wikilink">Gallup Organization</a>, Obama's nationwide favorable rating dropped from 50% to 45% while his challenger for the nomination, Hillary Clinton's, rating rose to 49%.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In this poll, McCain edged Obama by four percentage points in general election match ups, while Clinton was tied with McCain.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> As of May 5, a Gallup poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters showed Obama with a 5% lead over Clinton for the Democratic nomination.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>In poll data released <a href="3_May" title="wikilink">3 May</a> <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a> from the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>CBS News</em>, Obama's favorable/unfavorable rating among white Democrats remained the same from last summer. During the same period, Hillary Clinton's unfavorable rating among black Democrats increased by 36 percentage points. The <em>Times</em> theorized that the opinion shift among blacks was due to tactics of the Clinton campaign labelled 'racially tinged' by many vocal elements within the media, including the alleged 'amplifying' by Hillary Clinton of the Wright affair at numerous times.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
