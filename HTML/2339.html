<p><strong>Scavenger</strong> is the name of several <a href="fictional_characters" title="wikilink">fictional characters</a> in the <a href="Transformers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transformers</a> universes. Scavenger is usually depicted as a <a href="villain" class="uri" title="wikilink">villain</a> who turns into a construction vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="transformers-generation-1">Transformers: Generation 1</h2>

<p>Scavenger is a member of the <a href="Constructicons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constructicons</a> who turns into an <a href="excavator" class="uri" title="wikilink">excavator</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He combines with the other Constructicons to form the combiner robot <strong>Devastator</strong>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Scavenger is an unashamedly pathetic Decepticon. Desperate to prove his worth to his team-mates, he uses his one true gift - his shovel's ability to detect various magnetic, ionic, electrical or gas readings - to locate items of value, although invariably, all he can usually find is junk. He transforms into an <a href="excavator" class="uri" title="wikilink">excavator</a>, and the right arm of Devastator.</p>
<p>A recolor of the Scavenger toy was sold in Europe which didn't have a given name and didn't combine with his fellow Constructicons.</p>
<h3 id="marvel-comics">Marvel Comics</h3>
<p>The origins of the Constructicons in <a href="Marvel_Comics" title="wikilink">Marvel Comics</a>' <em>Transformers</em> series was not nearly so complicated. Seeking to bolster the size of his forces on Earth in 1985, Decepticon Commander <a href="Shockwave_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Shockwave</a> arranged for the construction of six new Decepticon bodies, which were then infused with life by the power of the <a href="Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership" title="wikilink">Creation Matrix</a>, tapped from the head of the imprisoned <a href="Optimus_Prime" title="wikilink">Optimus Prime</a>. Thus, the Constructicons were born, and were immediately put to work building a massive radio transmission dish that <a href="Soundwave_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Soundwave</a> used to beam a message to Cybertron. When the Autobots attempted to interfere, the Constructicons revealed their hidden power and merged into Devastator to fight them off, allowing the message to successfully go through.</p>
<p>Scavenger made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel <em>Generation 2</em> comic series, in a story called &quot;New Dawn.&quot; Megatron lead his Decepticons against <a href="Jhiaxus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jhiaxus</a>' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="animated-series">Animated series</h3>
<p>Scavenger first appeared in the season 1 episode &quot;Heavy Metal War&quot;. Originally to be named <strong>Scrounge</strong>, Scavenger was erroneously referred to by this name once in the Constructicons' debut animated series episode. He appears in <em><a href="The_Transformers:_The_Movie" title="wikilink">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em>. He was with the Decepticons when they ambushed the Autobot shuttle. He kills Prowl with a single blast from his gun.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>Scavenger appeared in the 1986 <a href="Ballantine_Books" title="wikilink">Ballantine Books</a> story <em><a href="The_Invisibility_Factor" title="wikilink">The Invisibility Factor</a></em> by <a href="Josepha_Sherman" title="wikilink">Josepha Sherman</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dreamwave-productions">Dreamwave Productions</h3>
<p>When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Scavenger joined up with the Decepticons under <a href="Megatron_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Megatron</a>.</p>
<p>Scavenger and the Constructions were successful in designing the first combiner, when they designed a united form for themselves called Devastator.</p>
<p>When Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. The Constructicons joined up with the <a href="Ultracons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ultracons</a> under the leadership of <a href="Ratbat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ratbat</a>.</p>
<p>When the Constructicons came with Earth they were reformatted into Earth-like construction vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="fun-publications">Fun Publications</h3>
<p>The <em><a href="Transformers_Classics" title="wikilink">Transformers Classics</a></em> comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine is set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of <em>Generation 2</em> did not occur. The story occurs fifteen years after Megatron was presumed dead in the crash of the Ark. Megatron survived, and eventually upgraded his body (based on his Classics toy) and gathered many other Decepticons to him. Soundwave helped him in recovering the body of Astrotrain, who was then used to help locate the placement of other fallen Decepticons around the globe. Those who joined Megatron included Laserbeak, <a href="Ramjet_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Ramjet</a>, Ravage, <a href="Skywarp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skywarp</a>, <a href="Soundwave_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Soundwave</a>, <a href="Starscream_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Starscream</a> and the <a href="Constructicons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constructicons</a>). Megatron also reactivated Thrust, Dirge and Thundercracker, but the three left him to join up with Bludgeon's troops - mostly because they couldn't work with Starscream, who had killed them once. Megatron's based his command from the wreck of the Ark in the Yukon, where he keeps the fallen body of Ratchet as a trophy and the severed, but living, head of Shockwave as an advisor.</p>

<p>Scavenger was a Basic-sized <a href="Vehicon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vehicon</a> which transformed into a Cybertronian Demolitions Vehicle. He did not appear in the TV series, nor is he related to any previous Transformer with the name Scavenger.

<p>Counted among the tank-type Vehicons, Scavenger is a powerhouse, crushing his enemies with brute force and very little subtlety - and he loves it. Commanded by <a href="Tankor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tankor</a> and armed with deadly electricity claws, Scavenger loves little more than what he was created for: pure destruction.</p>

<p>The second Autobot to bear the name Scavenger, he is painted as a homage to the Generation 1 Constructicons, and is called Devastar in Japan, the Japanese name of <a href="Constructicons" title="wikilink">Devastator</a>. His Decepticon appearance and name relates to his undercover work.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="armada-series">Armada series</h3>
<p>Scavenger made his first appearance in the show as a bounty hunter. One could suppose that his enormous strength and exceptional fighting skill were already well-known to all the Transformers because <a href="Megatron_(Unicron_Trilogy)" title="wikilink">Megatron</a> himself requested his services and promised to reward him handsomely if he assisted him to obtain the <a href="Star_Saber" title="wikilink">Star Saber</a> (much to the other Decepticons' displeasure). Scavenger helped Megatron to gather the <a href="Skyboom_Shield" title="wikilink">Skyboom Shield</a> up. Also he confronted <a href="Hot_Shot_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Hot Shot</a> in the several battles and defeated him easily, though the young warrior wielded the Star Saber. It seemed that Scavenger was a dangerous rogue who was in alliance with the Decepticons, but this was called into question when he later saved Hot Shot from being destroyed by the Decepticons when the latter has been abandoned by <a href="Sideways" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sideways</a> on the Moon. The truth was finally revealed, and it turned out that Scavenger was, in fact, actually an Autobot spying on the Decepticons. However, not all the 'Bots were friendly disposed towards him, and some of them, like <a href="Smokescreen_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Smokescreen</a>, considered him being a traitor. But soon those who mistrusted Scavenger had to acknowledge themselves wrong when he saved <a href="Optimus_Prime_(Unicron_Trilogy)" title="wikilink">Optimus Prime</a>'s life during just another battle with the Decepticons.</p>
<p>The main features of Scavenger's character were his self-possession and independency. When being among the 'Cons, he allowed himself to have the sly digs at Megatron himself, and the Decepticons' leader preferred to pay no attention to this. Later, when joining the 'Bots, he was the first who dared to take part of <a href="Starscream_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Starscream</a> when the latter arrived to the A-Base after his breaking with the Decepticons. Indeed, Scavenger always did and said everything he considered his duty to do or to say, and he never took much care of what the others would think about him. Also Scavenger was known for his harsh personality, which was contrasted by his tendency to sleep when off-duty. He trained the Armada incarnation of Optimus Prime as well as <a href="Blurr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blurr</a> and (over the course of the series), Hot Shot who, in his turn, conveyed his lessons to his own trainee <a href="Sideswipe_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Sideswipe</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dreamwave-productions-1">Dreamwave Productions</h3>
<p>Scavenger would also appear in the <a href="Dreamwave_Productions" title="wikilink">Dreamwave Productions</a>' <a href="Transformers:_Armada_(comics)" title="wikilink">comic</a> version of Armada. An Autobot from the very beginning, Scavenger was unable to stop the Decepticons from using the Mini-Cons to take over Cyber City. Later, when the Mini-Con distress beacon was activated, Scavenger accompanied Prime to Earth, battling <a href="Cyclonus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyclonus</a> and <a href="Starscream_(Unicron_Trilogy)" title="wikilink">Starscream</a>. He took part in many of the adventures on Earth, but nearly met his end after a full-scale Decepticon attack on the Autobot base in the wake of Optimus Prime's disappearance. With <a href="Smokescreen_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Smokescreen</a> nearly killed by <a href="Megatron_(Unicron_Trilogy)" title="wikilink">Megatron</a>, Scavenger, along with <a href="Hot_Shot_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Hot Shot</a> and <a href="Red_Alert_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Red Alert</a> attacked the Decepticon leader as he attempted to make a deal with Unicron, seemingly knocking him into Unicron's mouth and killing him.</p>
<p>Armada Scavenger continued to appear among the Autobots in the Transformers: Energon comic series by Dreamwave. His main appearance was in Issue #27 of the <em>Energon</em> Comic where he was one of the Autobots who volunteered to head to Earth to help battle the Terrorcon invasion.</p>

<p>Scavenger appeared in the text story from <a href="Fun_Publications" title="wikilink">Fun Publications</a> called &quot;Force of Habit.&quot; This story explained where he was during the events of the <em>Cybertron</em> story. <a href="Ultra_Magnus" title="wikilink">Ultra Magnus</a> was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys.

<p>Transtech Scavenger was among the concept characters for the proposed Transtech TV series.</p>
<p>After the <a href="Beast_Machines" title="wikilink">Beast Machines</a> line ended, <a href="Hasbro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hasbro</a> planned a follow-up series called <a href="Transtech" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transtech</a>. The Transtech concept was a line intended to take Transformers to their most futuristic. Hasbro commissioned sets of designs from <a href="Draxhall_Jump" title="wikilink">Draxhall Jump</a>. The series was supposedly to bring back some of the characters who died in <em><a href="Beast_Wars" title="wikilink">Beast Wars</a></em> along with some Generation 1 characters, all in new, more <a href="Organic_life" title="wikilink">organic</a>-looking bodies, though with vehicle alternate modes instead of the animals used in <em>Beast Machines</em>.
