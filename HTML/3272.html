<p>In mathematics, a <strong>separable algebra</strong> is a kind of <a href="semisimple_algebra" title="wikilink">semisimple algebra</a>. It is a generalization to <a href="associative_algebra" title="wikilink">associative algebras</a> of the notion of a <a href="separable_extension" title="wikilink">separable field extension</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition-and-first-properties">Definition and First Properties</h2>
<p>Let <em>K</em> be a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a>. An associative <em>K</em>-algebra <em>A</em> is said to be <strong>separable</strong> if for every <a href="field_extension" title="wikilink">field extension</a> <span class="math inline">$\scriptstyle L/K$</span> the algebra <span class="math inline">$\scriptstyle A\otimes_K L$</span> is semisimple.</p>
<p>There is a classification theorem for separable algebras: separable algebras are the same as finite products of matrix algebras over <a href="division_algebras" title="wikilink">division algebras</a> whose centers are finite dimensional <a href="separable_extension" title="wikilink">separable field extensions</a> of the field <em>K</em>. If <em>K</em> is a <a href="perfect_field" title="wikilink">perfect field</a> --- for example a field of characteristic zero, or a finite field, or an algebraically closed field --- then every extension of <em>K</em> is separable. As a result, if <em>K</em> is a perfect field, separable algebras are the same as finite products of matrix algebras over division algebras whose centers are finite-dimensional field extensions of the field <em>K</em>. In other words, if <em>K</em> is a perfect field, there is no difference between a separable algebra over <em>K</em> and a finite-dimensional <a href="semisimple_algebra" title="wikilink">semisimple algebra</a> over <em>K</em>.</p>
<p>There are a several equivalent characterizations of separable algebras. First, an algebra <em>A</em> is separable if and only if there exists an element</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$p = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \otimes y_i$$</span><br /></p>
<p>in <span class="math inline">$A^e = A \otimes_K A^{\rm op}$</span> such that</p>
<dl>

<dd><span class="math inline">$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i = 1_A$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and <em>ap</em> = <em>pa</em> for all <em>a</em> in <em>A</em>. Such an element <em>p</em> is called a <strong>separability idempotent</strong>, since it satisfies <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>p</em></span>. A generalized theorem of Maschke shows these this characterization of separable algebras is equivalent to the definition given above.</p>
<p>Second, an algebra <em>A</em> is separable if and only if it is <a href="projective_module" title="wikilink">projective</a> when considered as a left module of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span> in the usual way.</p>
<p>Third, an algebra <em>A</em> is separable if and only if it is <a href="flat_module" title="wikilink">flat</a> when considered as a right module of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span> in the usual (but perhaps not quite standard) way. See Aguiar's note below for more details.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a result of Eilenberg and Nakayama that any separable algebra can be given the structure of a symmetric <a href="Frobenius_algebra" title="wikilink">Frobenius algebra</a>. Since the underlying vector space of a Frobenius algebra is isomorphic to its dual, any Frobenius algebra is necessarily finite dimensional, and so the same is true for separable algebras.</p>
<p>A separable algebra is said to be <strong>strongly separable</strong> if there exists a separability idempotent that is <strong>symmetric</strong>, meaning</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$e = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \otimes y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \otimes x_i$$</span><br /></p>
<p>An algebra is strongly separable if and only if its trace form is nondegenerate, thus making the algebra into a special Frobenius algebra.</p>
<h2 id="commutative-separable-algebras">Commutative separable algebras</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">$\scriptstyle L/K$</span> is a field extension, then <em>L</em> is separable as an associative <em>K</em>-algebra if and only if the extension of field is <a href="separable_extension" title="wikilink">separable</a>. If L/K has <a href="Primitive_element_(field_theory)" title="wikilink">primitive element</a> a with irreducible polynomial <span class="math inline">$p(x) = (x - a) \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i x^i$</span>, then a separability idempotent is given by <span class="math inline">$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i \otimes_K \frac{b_i}{p'(a)}$</span>. The tensorands are dual bases for the trace map: if <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>σ</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> are the distinct K-monomorphisms of L into an algebraic closure of K, the trace mapping Tr of L into K is defined by Tr(x) = <span class="math inline">$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i(x)$</span>. The trace map and its dual bases make explicit L as a <a href="Frobenius_algebra" title="wikilink">Frobenius algebra</a> over K.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>If <em>K</em> is a field and <em>G</em> is a finite group such that the <a href="Order_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">order</a> of <em>G</em> is invertible in <em>K</em>, then the <a href="group_ring" title="wikilink">group ring</a> <em>K</em>[<em>G</em>] is a separable <em>K</em>-algebra. A separability idempotent is given by <span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{o(G)} \sum_{g \in G} g \otimes_K g^{-1}$</span>.</p>

<p>Let R be an associative ring with unit 1, and S a subring of R containing 1. Notice that an R-R-bimodule (see <a href="module_theory" title="wikilink">module theory</a> and <a href="homological_algebra" title="wikilink">homological algebra</a>) restricts to an S-S-bimodule. The ring extension R over S is said to be a separable extension if all short exact sequences of R-R-bimodules that are split as R-S-bimodules also split as R-R-bimodules. For example, the multiplication mapping m <br /><span class="math display"><em>R</em>⊗<sub><em>S</em></sub><em>R</em> → <em>R</em></span><br /> given by <span class="math inline"><em>m</em>(∑<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>r</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>⊗<sub><em>S</em></sub><em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) = ∑<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>r</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is an R-R-bimodule epimorphism, which is split as an R-S-bimodule epi by the right inverse mapping <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> → <em>R</em>⊗<sub><em>S</em></sub><em>R</em></span> given by <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> ↦ <em>r</em> ⊗ 1</span>. If R is a separable extension over S, then the multiplication mapping is split as an R-R-bimodule epi, so there is a right inverse s of m satisfying for s(1) := e, re = er for all r in R, and m(e) = 1. Conversely, if such an element (called a separability element in the tensor-square) exists, one shows by a judicious use of this element (like Maschke, applying its components within and without the splitting maps) that R is a separable extension of S.</p>
<p>Equivalently, the relative Hochschild cohomology groups <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>(<em>R</em>, <em>S</em>; <em>M</em>)</span> of (R,S) in any coefficient bimodule M is zero for n &gt; 0. Examples of separable extensions are many including first separable algebras where R = separable algebra and S = 1 times the ground field. More interestingly, any ring R with elements a and b satisfying ab = 1, but ba different from 1, is a separable extension over the subring S generated by 1 and bRa.</p>
<p>An interesting theorem in the area is that of J. Cuadra that a separable Hopf-Galois extension R | S has finitely generated natural S-module R. A fundamental fact about a separable extension R | S is that it is left or right semisimple extension: a short exact sequence of left or right R-modules that is split as S-modules, is split as R-modules. In terms of G. Hochschild's relative homological algebra, one says that all R-modules are relative (R,S)-projective. Usually relative properties of subrings or ring extensions, such as the notion of separable extension, serve to promote theorems that say that the over-ring shares a property of the subring. For example, a separable extension R of a semisimple algebra S has R semisimple, which follows from the preceding discussion.</p>
<p>There is the celebrated Jans theorem that a finite group algebra A over a field of characteristic p is of finite representation type if and only if its Sylow p-subgroup is cyclic: the clearest proof is to note this fact for p-groups, then note that the group algebra is a separable extension of its Sylow p-subgroup algebra B as the index is coprime to the characteristic. The separability condition above will imply every finitely generated A-module M is isomorphic to a direct summand in its restricted, induced module. But if B has finite representation type, the restricted module is uniquely a direct sum of multiples of finitely many indecomposables, which induce to a finite number of constituent indecomposable modules of which M is a direct sum. Hence A is of finite representation type if B is. The converse if proven by a similar argument noting that every subgroup algebra B is a B-bimodule direct summand of a group algebra A.</p>
