<p>During the period spanning the independence and <a href="partition_of_India" title="wikilink">partition of India and Pakistan</a> in 1947, the 562 <a href="princely_state" title="wikilink">princely states</a> that had existed outside <a href="British_India" title="wikilink">British India</a> under British <a href="suzerainty" class="uri" title="wikilink">suzerainty</a> were given a choice of acceding to either <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> or <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> or remaining outside them. Although the states were theoretically free to choose, <a href="Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="wikilink">Earl Mountbatten</a> stated that &quot;geographic compulsions&quot; meant that most of them would choose India. Mountbatten took the position that only states that shared a common border with Pakistan should choose to accede to it, but he had no power to impose this point of view on the states.</p>
<ul>

<li>15 Sep 1947 Accession to Pakistan accepted.</li>
<li>9 Nov 1947 Occupied by India.</li>

<li>24 Feb 1948 Referendum approves accession to India.</li>
<li>25 Feb 1948 Accession to India in effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>On September 15, 1947, Nawab <a href="Muhammad_Mahabat_Khanji_III" title="wikilink">Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III</a> of Junagadh, a princely state located on the south-western end of <a href="Gujarat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gujarat</a> and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing that Junagadh adjoined Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh — <a href="Mangrol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mangrol</a> and <a href="Babariawad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babariawad</a> — reacted by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the two states. Rulers of the other neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending troops to the Junagadh frontier, and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by <a href="Samaldas_Gandhi" title="wikilink">Samaldas Gandhi</a>, formed a government-in-exile, the <em>Aarzi Hukumat</em> (&quot;temporary government&quot;).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>India believed that if Junagadh was permitted to accede to Pakistan, communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and refused to accept the Nawab's choice of accession. The government pointed out that the state was 96% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession. India <a href="blockade" title="wikilink">cut off</a> supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the <a href="principality" title="wikilink">principalities</a> of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. Before leaving, the Nawab had emptied the state treasury of its cash and securities.</p>
<p>On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir <a href="Shah_Nawaz_Bhutto" title="wikilink">Shah Nawaz Bhutto</a>, the father of the more famous <a href="Zulfiqar_Ali_Bhutto" title="wikilink">Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto</a>, decided to invite the <a href="Government_of_India" title="wikilink">Government of India</a> to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the Regional Commissioner of <a href="Saurashtra_(region)" title="wikilink">Saurashtra</a> in the Government of India to this effect.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Government_of_Pakistan" title="wikilink">Government of Pakistan</a> protested, saying that since the Nawab had chosen to accede to Pakistan, the Dewan had no authority to negotiate a settlement with India. Also, if India could acquire Kashmir (with an overwhelming Muslim majority) because its ruler had decided to accede to India, then Pakistan could claim Junagadh</p>
<p>The government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the Dewan to intervene.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> A <a href="plebiscite" class="uri" title="wikilink">plebiscite</a> was conducted in February 1948,but it was not internationally monitored and Pakistan claims was not based on the plebiscite but on the logic of Kashmir Annexation, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Junagadh became a part of the Indian state of Saurashtra until 1 November 1956, when Saurashtra became part of <a href="Bombay_state" title="wikilink">Bombay state</a>.
