<p>The 29th Battalion was originally formed during the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, being raised in <a href="Victoria,_Australia" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> as part of the <a href="Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 10 August 1915.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Under the command of <a href="Lieutenant_Colonel" title="wikilink">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Alfred Bennett, an officer with over 20 years service in the part-time military forces, the battalion undertook initial training at <a href="Seymour,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Seymour</a> and then later <a href="Broadmeadows,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Broadmeadows Camp</a> along with the three other battalions of the <a href="8th_Brigade_(Australia)" title="wikilink">8th Brigade</a>, <a href="5th_Division_(Australia)" title="wikilink">5th Division</a>, to which it was assigned.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In November 1915 the battalion embarked upon the troopship HMAT <em>Ascanius</em> in <a href="Port_Melbourne" title="wikilink">Port Melbourne</a> and departed Australian waters, disembarking at <a href="Port_Suez" title="wikilink">Port Suez</a>, <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> on 7 December 1915.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The battalion arrived in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a> too late to take part in the fighting at <a href="Gallipoli_campaign" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a> however,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and as a result they were initially used to undertake defensive duties to protect the <a href="Suez_Canal" title="wikilink">Suez Canal</a> from <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> forces. They also undertook a comprehensive training program and by the time their orders arrived to transfer to Europe in June 1916, they had reached their peak.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> They subsequently embarked the troopship HMT <em>Tunisian</em> in <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, bound for <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> on 14 June.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The battalion arrived at <a href="Marseilles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marseilles</a> on 23 June and afterwards was transported by rail to <a href="Hazebrouck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hazebrouck</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> On 8 July the 5th Division was called up to the front from training behind lines in order to replace the battalions of the <a href="4th_Division_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Australian 4th Division</a> which were being transferred to the Somme. The 29th Battalion undertook a difficult two-day  approach march over cobbled roads with loads of up to  before arriving at the front on the night of 10/11 July.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Taking up a position between Boutillerie and Condonerrie in the Bois Grenier, they relieved the <a href="13th_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">13th Battalion</a> and on 19 July subsequently took part in an attack against the German positions around the &quot;Delangre Farm&quot; which was being held by the <a href="21st_Bavarian_Reserve_Infantry_Regiment" title="wikilink">21st Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Following the attack, the battalion held the line for another 11 days, beating off a particularly heavy German counterattack on 20 July, before they were eventually relieved.

<p>For the next two and half years they fought in a number of major battles in the trenches along the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> including <a href="Battle_of_Polygon_Wood" title="wikilink">Polygon Wood</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Amiens_(1918)" title="wikilink">Amiens</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_the_St_Quentin_Canal" title="wikilink">St Quentin Canal</a>, as well as playing a supporting role in a number of others including <a href="Second_Battle_of_Bullecourt" title="wikilink">Bullecourt</a> and <a href="Spring_Offensive" title="wikilink">Morlancourt</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> During the Allied <a href="Hundred_Days_Offensive" title="wikilink">Hundred Days Offensive</a> that was launched on 8 August 1918, the battalion took part in the 8th Brigade's advance up the treacherous Morcourt Valley, subsequently achieving a considerable feat by capturing the town of <a href="Vauvillers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vauvillers</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The battalion fought its last battle of the war in late September alongside the <a href="30th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">US 30th Infantry Division</a>, when they breached the German defences along the <a href="Hindenburg_Line" title="wikilink">Hindenburg Line</a> as part of the final Allied offensive of the war.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Aimed at the <a href="Le_Catelet" title="wikilink">Le Catelet</a> Line near <a href="Bellicourt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bellicourt</a>, the battalion began its advance on <a href="Nauroy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nauroy</a> on 29 September, moving on the left flank beside elements of the <a href="117th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)" title="wikilink">US 117th Infantry Regiment</a>, with the <a href="32nd_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">32nd Battalion</a> in support. The attack proved highly successful and 59 prisoners were captured along with four field guns and a quantity of German small arms. Against this the battalion lost 17 men killed and 63 wounded.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Following this, they were withdrawn from the front line.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> By this time casualties amongst the <a href="Australian_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian Corps</a> had reached critical level and as a result many battalions&lt;U+2014&gt;from an authorised strength of over 1,000 men<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;were only able to field between 300 to 400.

As a result of this, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks and training and recruitment were scaled back significantly.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1927, territorial titles were introduced into the Australian Army and the battalion adopted the title of the &quot;East Melbourne Regiment&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1929, following the election of the <a href="James_Scullin" title="wikilink">Scullin</a> <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Labor</a> government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain the part-time military force on a volunteer-only basis.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In order to reflect the change, the Citizen Forces was renamed the &quot;Militia&quot; at this time.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The end of compulsory training and the fiscal austerity that followed with the economic downturn of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> meant that the manpower available to many Militia units at this time dropped well below their authorised establishments and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Subsequently the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the <a href="22nd_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">22nd</a> in 1930, forming the <a href="29th/22nd_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">29th/22nd Battalion</a>, although they were later split again in August 1939 and the 29th re-raised in its own right.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-world-war">Second World War</h3>
<p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force for service overseas due to the provisions of the <em>Defence Act (1903)</em>, which precluded compelling the Militia to serve outside of Australian territory.

<p>In March 1942, the 4th Brigade was sent to <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> to undertake garrison duties and man defences along the coast to defend against a possible Japanese invasion.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> By mid-1942, however, due to manpower shortages that occurred in the Australian economy as a result of over <a href="Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">mobilisation of its military forces</a>, the Australian government decided to disband a number of Militia units in order to release their personnel back into the civilian workforce.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> As a result of this decision, in August 1942, the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the <a href="46th_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">46th Battalion</a> to form the <a href="29th/46th_Battalion_(Australia)" title="wikilink">29th/46th Battalion</a>.
