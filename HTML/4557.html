<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>Santorum and his wife, Karen Garver Santorum, have seven children: Elizabeth Anne (born 1991); Richard John (&quot;Johnny&quot;), Jr. (born 1993); Daniel James (born 1995); Sarah Maria (born 1998); Peter Kenneth (born 1999); Patrick Francis (born 2001); and Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Maria (born 2008). Bella was subsequently diagnosed with <a href="Trisomy_18" title="wikilink">Trisomy 18</a>, a serious genetic disorder which is fatal before birth in 90 per cent of cases.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1996, their son Gabriel Michael was born prematurely and lived for only two hours (a <a href="Medical_ultrasonography" title="wikilink">sonogram</a> taken before Gabriel was born revealed that his posterior urethral valve was closed and that the prognosis for his survival was therefore poor). While pregnant, Karen Santorum developed a life-threatening intrauterine infection and a fever that reached nearly 105 degrees. She went into labor when she was 20 weeks pregnant and allowed doctors to give her <a href="Oxytocin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxytocin</a> to speed the birth.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Karen Santorum wrote a book about the experience: <em>Letters to Gabriel: The True Story of Gabriel Michael Santorum</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In it, she writes that the couple brought the deceased infant home from the hospital and introduced the dead child to their living children as &quot;your brother Gabriel&quot; and slept with the body overnight before returning it to the hospital. The anecdote was also written about by Michael Sokolove in a 2005 <em><a href="New_York_Times_Magazine" title="wikilink">New York Times Magazine</a></em> story on Santorum.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Karen is also the author of a book on etiquette for children.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum and his family usually attend <a href="Latin_Mass" title="wikilink">Latin Mass</a> at <a href="Saint_Catherine_of_Siena" title="wikilink">Saint Catherine of Siena</a> Church, near Washington, D.C. On November 12, 2004, Santorum and his wife were invested as Knight and Dame of Magistral Grace of the <a href="Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta" title="wikilink">Knights of Malta</a> in a ceremony at <a href="St._Patrick&#39;s_Cathedral,_New_York" title="wikilink">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>After earning his Juris Doctor, Santorum became an administrative assistant to Republican State Senator <a href="Doyle_Corman" title="wikilink">Doyle Corman</a> (until 1986). He was director of the Pennsylvanian Senate's local government committee from 1981 to 1984, then director of the Pennsylvanian Senate's Transportation Committee until 1986.</p>
<p>In 1990, at age 32, Santorum was elected to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. House of Representatives</a> from <a href="Pennsylvania&#39;s_18th_District" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania's 18th District</a>, located in the eastern suburbs of <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>. He scored a significant upset, defeating a seven-term <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> incumbent, <a href="Doug_Walgren" title="wikilink">Doug Walgren</a>. Although the 18th was heavily Democratic, Santorum attacked Walgren for living outside the district for most of the year. He was re-elected in 1992, in part because the district lost its share of Pittsburgh as a result of redistricting. In Congress, as a member of the <a href="Gang_of_Seven" title="wikilink">Gang of Seven</a>, Santorum worked to expose congressional corruption by naming the guilty parties in the <a href="House_banking_scandal" title="wikilink">House banking scandal</a>.</p>
<p><img src="SantroumBarn.jpg" title="fig:A barn painted with Santorum&#39;s logo and slogan. The barn was used in a 1994 political advertisement." alt="A barn painted with Santorum&#39;s logo and slogan. The barn was used in a 1994 political advertisement." width="200" /> In 1994, at the age of 36, Santorum was <a href="United_States_Senate_election_in_Pennsylvania,_1994" title="wikilink">elected to the U.S. Senate</a>, defeating the incumbent Democrat, <a href="Harris_Wofford" title="wikilink">Harris Wofford</a>, who was 32 years older. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was &quot;Join the Fight!&quot; Santorum was <a href="U.S._Senate_election,_2000" title="wikilink">re-elected</a> in 2000 defeating Congressman <a href="Ron_Klink" title="wikilink">Ron Klink</a> by a 52.4% to 45.5% margin.</p>
<p>In 1996 he endorsed <a href="Arlen_Specter" title="wikilink">Arlen Specter</a> for president.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In a 2002 <a href="PoliticsPA" class="uri" title="wikilink">PoliticsPA</a> <a href="feature_story" title="wikilink">feature story</a> designating politicians with <a href="Yearbook" title="wikilink">yearbook superlatives</a>, he was named the &quot;Most Ambitious&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>As chairman of the <a href="Senate_Republican_Conference" title="wikilink">Senate Republican Conference</a>, Santorum directed the communications operations of Senate Republicans and was a frequent party spokesperson. He was the youngest member of the Senate leadership and the first Pennsylvanian to hold such a prominent position since Senator <a href="Hugh_Scott" title="wikilink">Hugh Scott</a> was Republican leader in the 1970s. In addition, Santorum served on the Senate Agriculture Committee; the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Senate Special Committee on Aging; and the <a href="Senate_Finance_Committee" title="wikilink">Senate Finance Committee</a>, of which he was the chairman of the Subcommittee on <a href="Social_Security_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Social Security</a> and Family Policy.</p>
<p>In January 2005, Santorum announced his intention to run for <a href="United_States_Senate_Republican_Whip" title="wikilink">United States Senate Republican Whip</a>, the second-highest post in the Republican caucus after the <a href="Pennsylvania_United_States_Senate_election,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 election</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The move came because it was presumed the incumbent whip, <a href="Mitch_McConnell" title="wikilink">Mitch McConnell</a> of <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>, was viewed as having the inside track to succeeding <a href="Bill_Frist" title="wikilink">Bill Frist</a> of <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a> as Senate Republican leader.</p>
<p>During the lame-duck session of the <a href="109th_United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">109th Congress</a>, Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against <a href="Robert_Gates" title="wikilink">Robert Gates</a> to become Secretary of Defense. He opposed Gates' advocacy of engaging <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a> and <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> to solve the problem, saying that talking to &quot;radical Islam&quot; would be an error.</p>
<p>During his third term re-election campaign for his Senate seat against <a href="Bob_Casey,_Jr." title="wikilink">Bob Casey, Jr.</a>, Santorum introduced the term &quot;Islamic fascism&quot;, while questioning &quot;his opponent's ability to make the right decisions on national security at a time when 'our enemies are fully committed to our destruction.'&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum sat at the Senate's <a href="candy_desk" title="wikilink">candy desk</a> for ten years and kept it stocked with <a href="The_Hershey_Company" title="wikilink">Hershey&lt;U+2019&gt;s chocolates</a>, <a href="Peanut_Chews" title="wikilink">Peanut Chews</a> and <a href="Hot_Tamales" title="wikilink">Hot Tamales</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum was defeated 59% to 41% in the <a href="United_States_Senate_election_in_Pennsylvania,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 U.S. Senate election</a> by Democratic candidate Bob Casey, Jr. This was the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent Senator since <a href="United_States_Senate_election_in_South_Dakota,_1980" title="wikilink">1980</a>.</p>
<h2 id="political-ideology">Political ideology</h2>
<p>He is known for his &lt;U+201C&gt;confrontational, partisan, &lt;U+2018&gt;in your face&lt;U+2019&gt; style of politics and government.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 2005, Santorum gave a speech that outlined the successes and failures&lt;U+2014&gt;but more centrally the future&lt;U+2014&gt;of conservatism, at the <a href="Heritage_Foundation" title="wikilink">Heritage Foundation</a>'s First International Conservative Conference on Social Justice. In November 2005, he adapted his speech into an <a href="Editorial" title="wikilink">op-ed</a> piece for the political website <a href="Townhall.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Townhall.com</a> outlining his vision for &quot;<a href="Compassionate_Conservatism" title="wikilink">Compassionate Conservatism</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>The <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> reported that on July 20, 2006, Santorum stated that &quot;Islamic fascism rooted in Iran is behind much of the world's conflict, but he is opposed to military action against the country&quot;, in a speech where he &quot;also defended the treatment of prisoners in <a href="Guantanamo_Bay" title="wikilink">Guantanamo Bay</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The senator indicated that &quot;effective action against Iran&quot; would require America's fighting &quot;for a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 7, 2006, Santorum outlined his views on foreign policy in an <a href="Editorial" title="wikilink">op-ed</a> piece for the <em><a href="Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a></em> and discussed Islamic fascism, closing with a rally cry:</p>

<p>Santorum has referred to his grandfather's historical encounter with Italian fascism as an inspiration for his 2012 presidential campaign.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legislation-and-issues">Legislation and issues</h2>
<p>Santorum has attracted support and criticism because of his <a href="socially_conservative" title="wikilink">socially conservative</a> and strong views, including his views on <a href="same-sex_marriage" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a>, homosexuality, and <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a>. His views are presented in his 2005 book, <em><a href="It_Takes_a_Family" title="wikilink">It Takes a Family</a></em>, published by the <a href="Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute" title="wikilink">Intercollegiate Studies Institute</a> of <a href="Wilmington,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a>, Delaware.</p>
<p>Santorum has been active in addressing the issues of welfare reform and government accountability. He is a self-described conservative who favors restricting or prohibiting <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a>. Santorum has said he is personally against abortion and has expressed disapproval of homosexuality, issues that he believes should be decided by elected officials rather than the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a>: &lt;U+201C&gt;what I&lt;U+2019&gt;d like to do is have these kinds of incredibly important moral issues be decided by the American public, not by nine unelected, unaccountable judges.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="illegal-immigration">Illegal immigration</h3>
<p>In 2006, Santorum opposed the Senate immigration reform proposal.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Instead, Santorum stated that the U.S. should act to enforce currently existing laws. He has openly stated his strong opposition to amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He supports the construction of a barrier along the U.S.&lt;U+2013&gt;Mexican border, an increase in the number of border patrol agents on the border, and the stationing of National Guard troops along the border. He also believes that undocumented immigrants should be deported immediately when they commit crimes, and that undocumented immigrants should not receive benefits from the government. Finally, the former senator believes that English should be established as the national language in the United States.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="intelligent-design">Intelligent design</h3>

<p>In 2001, Santorum tried unsuccessfully to insert language which came to be known as the &quot;<a href="Santorum_Amendment" title="wikilink">Santorum Amendment</a>&quot; into the <a href="No_Child_Left_Behind" title="wikilink">No Child Left Behind</a> bill that sought to promote the teaching of <a href="intelligent_design" title="wikilink">intelligent design</a> while questioning the academic standing of <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> in <a href="Public_school_(government_funded)" title="wikilink">public schools</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The amendment, crafted with the assistance of the <a href="Discovery_Institute" title="wikilink">Discovery Institute</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> would have required schools to discuss possible controversies surrounding scientific topics, and gave the theory of evolution as an example, opening the door for intelligent design as an opposing theory to be presented in science classrooms.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A federal court in Santorum's own state, along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the <a href="American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="wikilink">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, say the Institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a false perception that evolution is &quot;a theory in crisis&quot;, portraying it as being the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Though not included in the final version of the Act made law, the language from the amendment was included in a report attached to the Act known as the Conference Report. The Discovery Institute and many intelligent design proponents, including two Ohio Congressmen, have repeatedly invoked this to suggest that intelligent design should be included in public school science standards as an alternative to evolution.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In a 2002 <em><a href="Washington_Times" title="wikilink">Washington Times</a></em> op-ed article Santorum wrote that intelligent design &quot;is a legitimate scientific theory that should be taught in science classes.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> By 2005 Santorum had adopted the <a href="Discovery_Institute" title="wikilink">Discovery Institute</a>'s <a href="Teach_the_Controversy" title="wikilink">Teach the Controversy</a> approach,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> stating in an interview with <a href="National_Public_Radio" title="wikilink">National Public Radio</a> &quot;I'm not comfortable with intelligent design being taught in the science classroom.

<h3 id="workplace-religious-freedom-act">Workplace Religious Freedom Act</h3>
<p>Santorum and U.S. Senator <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a>, (<a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">D</a>-<a href="Massachusetts" title="wikilink">MA</a>), were the lead sponsors of the <a href="Workplace_Religious_Freedom_Act" title="wikilink">Workplace Religious Freedom Act</a> (WRFA), which would require employers to accommodate the religious observances of their employees as long as such accommodations would not impose an &quot;undue hardship&quot; on the employer. Thus, employers would be required to afford employees flexible work shifts so that they could observe religious holidays and to permit employees to wear religiously required clothing at work. Versions of the WRFA have been introduced in 1997, 2000, and 2003, but have failed to be enacted.</p>
<h3 id="national-weather-service">National Weather Service</h3>

<p>On April 14, 2005, Santorum introduced the <a href="National_Weather_Service_Duties_Act_of_2005" title="wikilink">National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005</a> to &quot;clarify the duties and responsibilities of the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> and the <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">National Weather Service</a> (NWS), and for other purposes&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> This legislation, if enacted, would prohibit the NWS from publishing weather data to the public when private-sector entities, such as <a href="AccuWeather" class="uri" title="wikilink">AccuWeather</a>, a company based in Santorum's home state, perform the same function commercially. Accuweather employees have contributed at least $5500 to Santorum since 1999, according to the Federal Election Commission.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Opponents of this bill contend that weather data is collected at taxpayer expense, and therefore it should be made freely available to the public, and not provided solely to private corporations that will charge fees for access. They also claim that the vague language in the bill is an attempt to prevent the NWS from issuing free forecasts because such functions are currently provided by the private sector and would be considered competition.</p>
<p>The bill was never enacted or voted upon, dying in committee.</p>
<h3 id="statements-regarding-homosexuality">Statements regarding homosexuality</h3>

<p>A controversy arose following Santorum's statements about homosexuality in an interview with the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> that was published on April 20, 2003. In response to a question about how to prevent <a href="child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">sexual abuse of children</a> by priests, Santorum said the priests were engaged in &quot;a basic homosexual relationship&quot;, and went on to say that he had &quot;[...] no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts&quot;; that the right to privacy, as detailed in <em><a href="Griswold_v._Connecticut" title="wikilink">Griswold v. Connecticut</a>,</em> &quot;doesn't exist in my opinion in the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a>&quot;; that, &quot;whether it's <a href="polygamy" class="uri" title="wikilink">polygamy</a>, whether it's adultery, whether it's <a href="sodomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">sodomy</a>, all of those things are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family&quot;; and that <a href="sodomy_law" title="wikilink">sodomy laws</a> properly exist to prevent acts that &quot;undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family&quot;. When the Associated Press reporter asked whether homosexuals should not then engage in homosexual acts, Santorum replied, &quot;Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>When questioned for his remarks, Santorum stated that they were intended not to equate homosexuality with <a href="incest" class="uri" title="wikilink">incest</a> and <a href="pedophilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pedophilia</a>, but rather as a critique of the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults (such as <a href="bigamy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bigamy</a>, incest, etc.).</p>
<p>In protest of the remarks, syndicated columnist <a href="Dan_Savage" title="wikilink">Dan Savage</a> launched a contest among his readers in May 2003 to coin a new word &quot;santorum&quot; with an unflattering sexual definition, and followed this with a Google bombing campaign to spread the new term. Since 2004, Savage's <a href="Google_bomb" title="wikilink">Google bomb</a> has regularly been the top search result for Santorum's surname, leading to what commentators have dubbed <a href="Campaign_for_&quot;santorum&quot;_neologism" title="wikilink">&quot;Santorum's Google problem&quot;</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Santorum has characterized the campaign as a &quot;type of vulgarity&quot; common on the Internet.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In an interview with <a href="Politico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Politico</a> on September 20, 2011, Santorum stated that he had contacted Google directly, asking for the removal of search results with the unflattering term.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2005, a controversy developed over comments about <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, Massachusetts, that Santorum made in a 2002 article about the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church_sex_abuse_scandal" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal</a>. Santorum wrote: </p>
<p>These comments came to wider attention through an opinion column in the <em><a href="Philadelphia_Daily_News" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Daily News</a></em> on June 24, 2005. Columnist <a href="John_Baer" title="wikilink">John Baer</a> cited Santorum's article, stating, &quot;I'd remind you this is the same Senate leader who recently likened Democrats fighting to save the <a href="filibuster" class="uri" title="wikilink">filibuster</a> to <a href="Reducto_ad_Hitlerum" title="wikilink">Nazis</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum's remarks were criticized, especially in <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>. On July 12, 2005, <em><a href="Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">Boston Globe</a></em> columnist Brian McGrory called on Santorum to explain his statement, and reported that Robert Traynham, Santorum's Director of Communications, told him &quot;It's an open secret that you have <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a> and <a href="MIT" class="uri" title="wikilink">MIT</a> that tend to tilt to the <a href="Left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left</a> in terms of academic biases. I think that's what the senator was speaking to.&quot; Julie Teer, a spokeswoman for Governor of Massachusetts, Republican <a href="Mitt_Romney" title="wikilink">Mitt Romney</a>, said &quot;What happened with the church sex abuse scandal was a tragedy, but it had nothing to do with geography or the culture of Boston.&quot;</p>
<p>Later that day, Senator <a href="Ted_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Ted Kennedy</a> (D-Massachusetts) delivered a personal rebuke to Santorum on the Senate floor, saying &quot;The people of Boston are to blame for the clergy sexual abuse? That is an irresponsible, insensitive and inexcusable thing to say.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Santorum has stood by his 2002 article and has not apologized.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2005, <a href="Rush_Limbaugh" title="wikilink">Rush Limbaugh</a> interviewed Santorum about Kennedy's speech. Santorum said that he was being targeted by the <a href="Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee" title="wikilink">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>, which, he said, coordinated with the media to publicize Kennedy's speech. He argued that his statement about Boston was taken out of context from an article he had written three years earlier. Santorum agreed with Limbaugh's summary that it was &quot;no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston.&quot; Santorum reiterated his broader theme of a cultural connection, saying that it is &quot;no surprise that the culture affects people's behavior. [...] the liberal culture&lt;U+2014&gt;the idea that [...] sexual inhibitions should be put aside and people should be able to do whatever they want to do, has an impact on people and how they behave.&quot; When asked why Boston specifically was mentioned, Santorum pointed out that, in July 2002, the outrage of American Catholics, as well as his own, was focused on the <a href="Archdiocese_of_Boston" title="wikilink">Archdiocese of Boston</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hurricane-katrina">Hurricane Katrina</h3>
<p>On September 4, 2005, Santorum spoke to a <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> television station, <a href="WTAE-TV" title="wikilink">WTAE</a>, about the evacuation warnings given for <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>:</p>

<p>The campaign of Bob Casey, Jr., his Democratic opponent for the Senate, criticized Santorum's remarks.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 6, in a follow-up interview with WTAE, Santorum said,</p>

<p>On September 8, during an interview with <a href="public_radio" title="wikilink">public-radio</a> station <a href="WITF-FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">WITF-FM</a>, in <a href="Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Harrisburg</a>, Pennsylvania, Santorum said</p>

<p>Santorum was the sponsor of legislation proposed to <em>prevent</em> the National Weather Service from issuing those warnings, thus competing with <a href="private_sector" title="wikilink">private-sector</a> weather services, as discussed <a href="Rick_Santorum#Legislation_and_issues" title="wikilink">above</a>.</p>
<p>Santorum added a <a href="synthetic_fuel" title="wikilink">synthetic-fuel</a> tax-credit amendment to a larger bill introduced in the Senate by <a href="Charles_Grassley" title="wikilink">Charles Grassley</a>, the <a href="Iowa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iowa</a> Republican who headed the <a href="United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Finance" title="wikilink">Senate Finance Committee</a>. <em><a href="Time_Magazine" title="wikilink">Time Magazine</a></em> called this tax-credit scheme &quot;a multibillion-dollar <a href="scam" class="uri" title="wikilink">scam</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The amendment was inserted in the <a href="Taxation_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Tax Relief Act</a> of 2006, which provides aid for Hurricane Katrina victims and sets new policies for <a href="tax-exempt" class="uri" title="wikilink">tax-exempt</a> groups.</p>
<h3 id="pennsylvania-residency-and-tuition-fee">Pennsylvania residency and tuition fee</h3>
<p>In November 2004, a controversy developed over education costs for Santorum's children. Santorum's legal address is a three-bedroom house in <a href="Penn_Hills,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Penn Hills</a>, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, which he purchased for $87,800 in 1997 and is located next to the home of his wife's parents. But since 2001, he has spent most of the year in <a href="Leesburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Leesburg</a>, Virginia, a town about one hour's drive west of Washington, D.C., and about 90 minutes' drive south of the Pennsylvania border, in a house he purchased for $643,000. The <em>Penn Hills Progress</em>, a local paper, reported that Santorum and his wife paid about $2,000 per year in property taxes on their Pennsylvania home ($487.20 per year to Allegheny County, 2006 through 2008, based on a 2007 value of $106,000,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> plus Penn Hills School District tax). The paper also found that another couple&lt;U+2014&gt;possibly renters&lt;U+2014&gt;were registered voters at the same address.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time the issue arose, Santorum's five older children attended the <a href="Western_Pennsylvania_Cyber_Charter_School" title="wikilink">Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School</a>,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> with 80 percent of tuition costs paid by the Penn Hills School District.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> At a meeting in November 2004, the Penn Hills School District announced that it did not believe Santorum met the qualifications for residency status, because he and his family spent most of the year in Virginia. They demanded repayment of tuition costs totaling $67,000.</p>
<p>When news reports showed Sen. Santorum was renting his Penn Hills home, Santorum withdrew his five children from the cyber education program that Penn Hills School District paid for. That saved Penn Hills taxpayers about $38,000 a year.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Although Santorum said he would make other arrangements for his children's education, he insisted that he did not owe the school board any back tuition. Once the controversy surfaced, the children were withdrawn from the cyber school and were then home schooled.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 8, 2005, a Pennsylvania state hearing officer had ruled that the Penn Hills School District had not filed objections to Santorum's residency in a timely manner and dismissed the complaint. Santorum hailed the ruling as a victory against what he termed &quot;baseless and politically motivated charges&quot;. Santorum told reporters that &quot;[n]o one's children&lt;U+2014&gt;and especially not small, school-age children&lt;U+2014&gt;should be used as pawns in the '<a href="Opposition_research" title="wikilink">politics of personal destruction</a>.'&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the 2006 senate campaign, Santorum ran television commercials with Santorum's son saying &quot;My dad's opponents have criticized him for moving us to Washington so we could be with him more.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education agreed to pay the district $55,000 to settle the dispute over money withheld from the district to pay for the children of U.S. Senator Rick Santorum to attend a cyber charter school.</p>
<p>The matter rose again in May 2006. Santorum has said that his family stays during holidays and at times on weekends at the Penn Hills house. But the <em>Progress</em> reported in May that the house appeared unoccupied, and Casey's campaign noted that in a press release. Santorum then accused Casey's campaign of supporting trespassing on his property, saying of Casey &quot;Now that he is a nominee, it is time for him to start acting like a candidate instead of a thug.&quot; Casey, in a statement, called the charges &quot;false and malicious.&quot; His campaign, in a news release, described Santorum's actions as &quot;weirdness&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 2006, Santorum formally asked that the county remove the homestead tax exemption from his Penn Hills residence. He said that he had made similar requests to county officials in conversations in 2005 and earlier in 2006, but to no avail. In his letter, Santorum insisted that he was entitled to the exemption, which is worth about $70 annually, but chose not to take advantage of it because of the political dispute.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> While homeowners in the county are eligible for a tax savings averaging $70 a year on their primary residences, the county council president noted that Santorum had &quot;said during a televised debate that he spends about 30 days in his Penn Hills house each year.&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Allegheny County Election Office records indicate that, while a registered voter in the county, Santorum had since 1995 voted absentee.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The only way for Santorum to not pay for his children's private education was to enroll them in the Penn Hills School District. Virginia state law only requires local school districts to pay for private school tuition fee when a student has disabilities and enrolls in a school that can satisfy his or her needs, according to Charles Pyle, Virginia Department of Education spokesman. Otherwise, children in Virginia must attend their local public schools.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum's supporters have said that the controversy is politically motivated because the school board is controlled by Democrats (Erin Vecchio, the school board member who first publicly raised the issue, is the chair of the local Democratic Party). They also have said that since Santorum votes in Penn Hills and pays <a href="property_tax" title="wikilink">property</a> and school taxes there, he is entitled to the same privileges as any other Penn Hills resident and should not be deprived of these privileges as a result of his service in the U.S. Senate.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Non-residency issues have raised questions of hypocrisy, in that Santorum had previously castigated Representative Doug Walgren for moving away from his district.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="declaration-regarding-wmds-in-iraq">Declaration regarding WMDs in Iraq</h3>
<p>In June 2006, Santorum declared that <a href="weapons_of_mass_destruction" title="wikilink">weapons of mass destruction</a> (WMDs) had been found in Iraq.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The specific weapons he referred to were chemical munitions dating back to the <a href="Iran&lt;U+2013&gt;Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iran&lt;U+2013&gt;Iraq War</a> that were buried in the early 1990s. The report stated that while agents had degraded to an unknown degree, they remained dangerous and possibly lethal.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Officials of the Department of Defense, CIA intelligence analysts, and the White House have all explicitly stated that these expired casings are not part of the WMDs threat that <a href="Operation_Iraqi_Freedom" title="wikilink">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a> was launched to contain.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum's declaration was based, in part, on declassified portions of a classified report from the National Ground Intelligence Center of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Portions were declassified in a summary that made six key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 2003, Coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded or vacant <a href="mustard_gas" title="wikilink">mustard</a> or <a href="sarin" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarin</a> nerve agent casings.</li>
<li>Despite many efforts to locate and destroy Iraq&lt;U+2019&gt;s pre&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Gulf_War" title="wikilink">Gulf War</a> chemical munitions, filled and unfilled warheads are believed to still exist. They have no viable military capability, however.</li>
<li>Pre&lt;U+2013&gt;Gulf War chemical munitions could be sold on the <a href="black_market" title="wikilink">black market</a>. Use of these weapons by terrorists or <a href="Iraqi_insurgency" title="wikilink">insurgent</a> groups could have implications for Coalition forces in Iraq.</li>
<li>The most likely munitions remaining are sarin- and mustard-filled projectile casings.</li>
<li>The purity of the agent inside the munitions depends on many factors, including the manufacturing process, potential additives, and environmental storage conditions. While agents degrade over time, the residue could be hazardous upon dermal contact.</li>
<li>It has been reported in open press that insurgents and Iraqi groups desire to acquire and use chemical weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="animal-rights">Animal rights</h3>
<p>In 2005 a coalition of <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a> groups, spearheaded by the <a href="Humane_Society_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Humane Society of the United States</a> (HSUS) and the <a href="Doris_Day_Animal_League" title="wikilink">Doris Day Animal League</a> (DDAL) mounted a failed effort to push the <em>Pet Animal Welfare Statute of 2005</em> (PAWS) through Congress. The bill was proposed by Senator Santorum and sponsored by Senator <a href="Dick_Durbin" title="wikilink">Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (then-R-PA). PAWS would have reclassified most small and hobby breeders as commercial breeders subjecting them to <a href="USDA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USDA</a> regulations, allowed home inspections and placed fees and compliance expenses on pet breeders. Fellow Congressmen were told that PAWS was &quot;the <a href="puppy_mill" title="wikilink">puppy mill</a> bill&quot;. This was Santorum's third failed attempt at pet-related legislation.</p>
<h3 id="aclu-suit">ACLU suit</h3>
<p>In 2005, four teenagers were ejected from a bookstore in Wilmington, Delaware, where Santorum was scheduled for a book signing, after they were overheard expressing critical opinions of the senator.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a> filed suit, which was settled in 2007. As a result of the settlement, the Delaware State Police were required to pay legal fees for the plaintiffs and provide training to officers on free speech rights. The Santorum staff members who requested the ejection were required to apologize and to relinquish their salaries for the event&lt;U+2014&gt;$2,500.00&lt;U+2014&gt;to plaintiffs in damages.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>As a key member of the <a href="Gang_of_Seven" title="wikilink">Gang of Seven</a> (a group of seven freshmen Republican Congressmen), Santorum helped expose a <a href="House_banking_scandal" title="wikilink">scandal</a> at the House Bank. The Gang of Seven's reform-minded agenda is often cited as a foundation of the <a href="Republican_Revolution" title="wikilink">1994 Republican takeover</a> of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>In 1996, as a U.S. senator, Santorum served as Chairman of the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> Task Force on Welfare Reform.. The legislation that became the <a href="Welfare_Reform_Act_of_1996" title="wikilink">Welfare Reform Act of 1996</a> written by Florida congressman <a href="E._Clay_Shaw,_Jr." title="wikilink">E. Clay Shaw, Jr.</a>, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a>.</p>
<p>Though not a named author of the special Schiavo legislation, Santorum played a key role in shepherding the bill through the Senate to a vote on March 20, 2005. Santorum has frequently stated that he does not believe a &quot;<a href="right_to_privacy" title="wikilink">right to privacy</a>&quot; exists under the Constitution, even within marriage; he has been especially critical of the Supreme Court decision in <em><a href="Griswold_v._Connecticut" title="wikilink">Griswold v. Connecticut</a></em> (1965), which held that the Constitution guaranteed the aforementioned right, and on that basis, overturned a law prohibiting the sale and use of <a href="birth_control" title="wikilink">contraceptives</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum is also a supporter of partial privatization of <a href="Social_Security_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Social Security</a>. Since the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 presidential election</a>, Santorum has held forums across Pennsylvania on the topic.</p>
<p>In 2005, Santorum sponsored the <a href="Iran_Freedom_and_Support_Act" title="wikilink">Iran Freedom and Support Act</a>, which appropriated $10 million aimed at <a href="regime_change" title="wikilink">regime change</a> in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the <a href="Lautenberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lautenberg</a> amendment which would have closed the loophole which allows companies like <a href="Halliburton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halliburton</a> to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>In reference to the <a href="Iraq_war" title="wikilink">Iraq war</a> in 2006, Santorum drew an analogy with <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> in one of his addresses:</p>

<p>Santorum informed senator <a href="John_Ensign" title="wikilink">John Ensign</a> that Ensign's affair with a staff member was about to become publicly known.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="campaign">2006 campaign</h2>


<p>In 2006, Santorum sought re-election to a third term in the U.S. Senate. His Democratic opponent was State Treasurer <a href="Robert_P._Casey,_Jr." title="wikilink">Bob Casey, Jr.</a>, the son of popular former governor <a href="Robert_P._Casey" title="wikilink">Robert Casey, Sr.</a>(D) Santorum's seat was a prime target of Democratic efforts to gain Senate seats in the <a href="U.S._Senate_election,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 elections</a>. Casey's candidacy was bolstered by his opposition to abortion, negating one of Santorum's key issues.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Republican strategists took as a bad omen Santorum's primary result in 2006, in which he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Republican gubernatorial nominee <a href="Lynn_Swann" title="wikilink">Lynn Swann</a>, also unopposed, garnered 22,000 more votes statewide than Santorum in the primary, meaning thousands of Republican voters abstained from endorsing Santorum for another Senate term. This may have been partly due to Santorum's support for Arlen Specter, over Congressman <a href="Pat_Toomey" title="wikilink">Pat Toomey</a> in the 2004 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Even though Santorum is only slightly less conservative than Toomey, he joined virtually all of the state and national Republican establishment in supporting the moderate Specter. This led many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans to consider Santorum's support of Specter to be a betrayal of their cause.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 22, 2006, the polling firm Rasmussen Reports declared that Santorum was the &quot;most vulnerable incumbent&quot; among the Senators running for re-election.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> However, in August 2006, polling showed Santorum with his highest approval rating in months, 48 percent, a twelve-point jump between July and August. Nearly as many Pennsylvanians, 45 percent, said they had an unfavorable view of the Senator.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>For most of the campaign, Santorum was behind by 15 points or more. Most polls during the summer of 2006 showed the race between Casey and Santorum becoming <a href="Pennsylvania_United_States_Senate_election,_2006#Opinion_polling" title="wikilink">increasingly competitive</a>, but a poll released by <a href="Quinnipiac_University" title="wikilink">Quinnipiac University</a> on September 26 showed Casey's margin ballooning back to a double-digit lead.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>One day before the Quinnipiac poll was released, a Pennsylvania state judge ruled against a potential third-party candidate, Carl Romanelli of the Green Party. Romanelli fell about 8,900 petition signatures shy of the threshold needed to be placed on the statewide ballot in November. On October 4, 2006, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court also rejected Romanelli's legal challenge.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> This was a potential blow to the Santorum campaign, as Romanelli was expected to siphon off some Casey voters.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>There is also some question as to whether Romanelli and Pennsylvania's Green Party violated federal election laws when they accepted tens of thousands of dollars in donations from people also backing Santorum's campaign.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum found himself mired in controversy over his residency. For many years, he has maintained a modest home in <a href="Penn_Hills,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Penn Hills</a>, a suburb of Pittsburgh, which he claims as his official residence.  However, his family lived in the <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> suburbs of Washington when the Senate was in session. Since this meant Santorum spent most of the year away from Pennsylvania, critics argued it was not unlike the living arrangements he denounced in his 1990 House race against Walgren. Santorum accused Walgren of being out of touch with his Pittsburgh-area district, symbolized by his home in the Virginia suburbs. On <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>'s <a href="Meet_the_Press" title="wikilink">Meet the Press</a> on September 3, 2006, Santorum admitted that he only spends &quot;maybe a month a year, something like that&quot; at his Pennsylvania residence.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum also drew criticism for enrolling five of his six children in an online &quot;cyber school&quot; in Pennsylvania's <a href="Allegheny_County" title="wikilink">Allegheny County</a> (home to Pittsburgh and most of its suburbs), despite the fact the children lived in Virginia. The <a href="Penn_Hills" title="wikilink">Penn Hills</a> School District was billed $73,000 in tuition for the cyber classes.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>At least one of Santorum's television ads called into question his campaign's use of the facts regarding Casey and persons who have donated money to the Casey campaign. According to the ad, some of the persons who have given Casey money are or have been under investigation for various crimes. An editorial in Casey's hometown newspaper, <em><a href="The_Times-Tribune_(Scranton)" title="wikilink">The Scranton Times-Tribune</a></em>, points out that all but one of the contributions &quot;[was] made to Casey campaigns when he was running for other offices, at which time none of the contributors were known to be under investigation for anything.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In fact, two of the persons cited in the Santorum campaign ad had actually given contributions to Mr. Santorum's 2006 Senate campaign. Another died in 2004.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> However, the Santorum campaign pointed out that the money the Santorum campaign received from those donors was not kept by the campaign, but rather donated to educational institutions.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>A heated debate between the candidates occurred on October 11, 2006.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> There, according to coverage by <em><a href="Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a></em>, the candidates appeared &quot;less statesmanlike than either Gov. Ed Rendell or challenger Lynn Swann, who had debated each other in Pittsburgh the [previous] week&quot;.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>In late October, during the Lebanon County Republican Committee&lt;U+2019&gt;s annual dinner at the Lantern Lodge, Santorum said &quot;If we are not successful here and things don&lt;U+2019&gt;t go right in the election, there&lt;U+2019&gt;s a good chance that the course of our country could change.&quot; &quot;We are in the equivalent of the late 1930s, and this election will decide whether we are going to continue to appease or whether we will stand and fight while we have a chance to win without devastating consequences.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum on August 28 gave a speech to Pennsylvania media at the Pennsylvania Press Club luncheon in Harrisburg (which he earlier gave to the National Club) claiming that terrorist attacks on America by &quot;radical Islamists&quot; were part of a more than three-century-old plot to restore Shia clerics to power and bring &quot;the <a href="Muhammad_al-Mahdi" title="wikilink">12th Imam</a>&quot; out of hiding. He said, according to the online news service, <a href="Capitolwire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Capitolwire</a>: &lt;U+201C&gt;They believe, as all Shias do, in the Hidden Imam, the 12th Imam,&quot; the 12th descendant in a straight line from Mohammed the Prophet, who disappeared in 874, at the age of 5. &lt;U+201C&gt;The Shia believe that he is the Messiah and he is in hiding and that he will return. &lt;U+2026&gt; They believe &lt;U+2026&gt; he will return with radical Islam, when Shia dominates the world. Well, for over 1,000 years, ... the East and West fought, up until 1683 ... In 1683, not that long ago, the Islamists had surrounded the gates of Vienna and were on the verge of toppling it after a siege; ... but the West united, and led by the Poles, [King] John Sobieski and the Polish Hussars defeated [the Arab forces] in a one-day battle on the plains outside Vienna. &lt;U+201C&gt;What was the high-water mark of this 1,000-year war? It was the day before. What was the date the day before? Sept. 11, 1683.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>This speech eventually led to Santorum launching a tour called &quot;The Gathering Storm,&quot; comparing himself to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who alerted his nation and the world to the Nazi menace in the 1930s, and then fought with America, Russia and others to defeat the Germans, Italians and Japan in World War II in the 1940s.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The Associated Press' Jennifer Yates wrote on Oct. 27 that Santorum said: &quot;This is a moment, a critical crossroads in American history,&quot; as she noted that &quot;Santorum, who invoked Winston Churchill's memoir &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; about the causes of World War II&quot; then told her and audiences: &quot;The parallel is so profound.&quot;</p>
<p>Days before, Yates reported, Santorum said: Casey's election and that of other Democrats trying to take over the U.S. House and Senate would be &quot;a disaster for the future of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>On the Sunday before the election, Casey responded to the comment, telling Capitolwire: &quot;Who runs a campaign like that? No one believes terrorists are going to be more likely to attack us, because I defeat Rick Santorum. Does even he believe that?&quot;</p>
<p>Santorum wrote that many women have disclosed to him that it is more &quot;socially affirming to work outside the home than to give up their careers to take care of their children.... What happened in America so that mothers and fathers who leave their children in the care of someone else &lt;U+2013&gt; or worse yet, home alone after school between three and six in the afternoon &lt;U+2013&gt; find themselves more affirmed by society? Here, we can thank the influence of radical feminism.&quot; Polls showed many female voters resented this description of why they worked, especially Republican and independent women whose abandonment of Santorum doomed his campaign, reported the online news service Capitolwire, based in Harrisburg. In a question-and-answer session on Aug. 28 at the Pennsylvania speech, Santorum tried again to address the issue and said his problem was that federal taxes now consumed 27 percent of family wages, and the second wage earner in most families made only 25 percent of the first's wages.</p>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;First, I would say, read the book and I think if you read the book, you can answer the question yourself. Because anyone who has read the book instead of the comments pulled out by the <a href="Democratic_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Democratic National Committee</a> about the book, which was four sentences, by the way, in a 430-page book, &lt;U+2026&gt; would tell you I am supportive of families in a variety of different ways. ... What does the average second-earner in the family make? Twenty five percent of the first earner. ... Because of our tax code, we make it virtually impossible to maintain a standard of living and at the same time, be home with your children. ... Number two, look, I believe that women should have choices when it comes to the workforce. And they should be real choices. &quot;And look, I came from a family where my mother worked, all her life, made more money than my dad (N.B.: his mother and father were a registered nurse and psychiatrist, respectively). I have more people working in my office who are women, in senior policy positions, than men. So I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have a hang-up with women working. I do have a hang-up with the government and others in society not nurturing, supporting and encouraging parents to be home with their kids when they need to be home. And I think we need to do more as a society to help them.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>In the November election, Santorum lost, with 41% of the vote to Casey's 59%,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> the largest margin of defeat ever for an incumbent Republican Senator in Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="post-senate-career">Post-Senate career</h2>
<p>Before failing to win re-election in 2006, Santorum had frequently been mentioned as a possible <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 presidential candidate</a>. Such speculation faded when, during the course of the campaign and in light of unimpressive poll numbers, he declared that, if re-elected, he would serve a full term. After he lost, Santorum once again ruled out a presidential run.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2007 Santorum joined Eckert Seamans Cherin &amp; Mellott, LLC, where he primarily practiced law in the firm's <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> and Washington, D.C. offices providing business and strategic counseling services to the firm's clients. He also joined the <a href="Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center" title="wikilink">Ethics and Public Policy Center</a>, a D.C.-based conservative <a href="think_tank" title="wikilink">think tank</a>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Santorum was also a contributor on the <a href="Fox_News_Channel" title="wikilink">Fox News Channel</a>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Santorum also writes an Op/Ed piece titled &quot;The Elephant in the Room&quot; for the Commentary Page of the <a href="Philadelphia_Inquirer" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Santorum told the <em><a href="Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a></em> that he would address many geopolitical issues, and then joked, &quot;I don't do <a href="Anna_Nicole_Smith" title="wikilink">Anna Nicole Smith</a>, that's all.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> After leaving the Senate, Santorum joined the Board of Directors of <a href="Universal_Health_Services" title="wikilink">Universal Health Services</a>, a hospital management company based in <a href="King_of_Prussia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">King of Prussia</a>, Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>On February 1, 2008, Santorum said he would vote for <a href="Mitt_Romney" title="wikilink">Mitt Romney</a> in the 2008 Presidential Republican primary race, stating: &quot;If you're a Republican, if you're a Republican in the broadest sense, there is only one place to go right now and that's Mitt Romney.&quot;.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> He has criticized John McCain, questioning his pro-life voting record and whether Sen. McCain holds true conservative values. In September 2008, Santorum expressed support for McCain, citing <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a> as a step in the right direction: &quot;Knowing McCain, he's choosing someone in whom he sees a lot of himself...He tries to find people who have a similar head as he does, and if he sees him in [Palin]...that gives me a better feel for him and a little more confidence in him.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In 2011 he said McCain, who was tortured as a <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoner of war</a>, did not understand how the &quot;<a href="Enhanced_interrogation_techniques" title="wikilink">enhanced interrogation</a>&quot; process works.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>On April 12, 2007, political action committee America's Foundation, <a href="Highmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Highmark</a> and a former Highmark vice president were fined by the Federal Election Committee for sponsoring Santorum with corporate money.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The problem had been reported by Highmark, which uncovered the matter during an internal review.</p>
<p>Santorum was mentioned as a candidate for <a href="Governor_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Governor of Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania_gubernatorial_election,_2010" title="wikilink">2010</a>.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> At one point, he was said to have &quot;quietly but efficiently put his fingerprints on a wide-array of conservative causes in the state.&quot;<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> However, Santorum declined to seek the gubernatorial nomination and instead endorsed eventual winner <a href="Tom_Corbett" title="wikilink">Tom Corbett</a>.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="presidential-campaign">2012 presidential campaign</h2>

<p>In the fall of 2009, Santorum hinted that he was considering a run for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2012" title="wikilink">2012 presidential election</a>. On September 11, 2009, Santorum spoke to a group of Catholic leaders in Orlando, Florida and told them, &quot;I hate to be calculating, but I see that 2012 is not just throwing somebody out to be eaten, but it's a real opportunity for success.&quot; He scheduled various appearances with political non-profit organizations that took place in Iowa.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>Santorum repeated his consideration of a 2012 run in an e-mail and letter sent on January 15, 2010 to supporters of his political action committee, saying, &quot;After talking it over with my wife Karen and our kids &lt;U+2013&gt; I am considering putting my name in for the 2012 presidential race. I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, but I have a burning desire to have a different president of the United States&quot;.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011.</p>
<p>Santorum formally announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination on ABC's <em>Good Morning America</em> on June 6, 2011, saying he's &quot;in it to win.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 16th, 2011, Rick Santorum announced that he was replacing Michael Biundo as National Political Director with Ajay Bruno, a rising conservative political operative. The reasons cited were the minimal traction gained in the campaign as well as many internal problems with poor staffing choices. <a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

A number of bills require that students be taught to &quot;critically analyze&quot; evolution or to understand &quot;the controversy.&quot; But there is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of the theory of evolution.
