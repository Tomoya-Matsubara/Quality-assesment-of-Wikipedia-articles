<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil was born in <a href="Mustafino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mustafino</a>, a village in the <a href="Orenburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orenburg</a> <a href="guberniya" class="uri" title="wikilink">guberniya</a> in the family of <a href="junkman" class="uri" title="wikilink">junkman</a>. He graduated <em><a href="X&lt;U+00F6&gt;s&lt;U+00E4&gt;yeni&lt;U+00E4&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">X&lt;U+00F6&gt;s&lt;U+00E4&gt;yeni&lt;U+00E4&gt;</a></em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="madrassah" class="uri" title="wikilink">madrassah</a> in Orenburg. His first publishing were revolutionary verses. The long-going Turkic poetic tradition of <em><a href="aruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">aruz</a></em> traced in C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's early works, which attributed to <em><a href="Ghisyanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghisyanism</a></em>, <em>a style of revolt</em>, found in the Tatar poetry of early 1920s. In 1919 he entered underground <a href="Komsomol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Komsomol</a> cell of Orenburg, which was under the <a href="White_movement" title="wikilink">Whites</a> that time. Then Musa participated in the <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a>, but due to his nonage he didn't fight at the front, but in special <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a> unit, cleaning out pro-White gangs. In 1920 C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil returned to the native village, establishing pro-communist youth organization <em>The Red Flower</em> there. He also became an Komsomol activist in Mustafino. He represented his village at the governorate Komsomol conference.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="literary-life">Literary life</h2>
<p>In 1920 the <a href="Tatar_ASSR" title="wikilink">Tatar ASSR</a> was proclaimed and <a href="Kazan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kazan</a> was established as its capital. In 1922 Musa as many other Tatar poets moved to Kazan. This early period of C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's life is co-called <em>Red period</em>, mostly due to his favorite <a href="epithet" class="uri" title="wikilink">epithet</a>: his most prominent verses of that period are <em>The Red Host</em>, <em>The Red Holyday</em>, <em>The Red Hero</em>, <em>The Red Way</em>, <em>The Red Force</em> and <em>The Red Banner</em>. In Kazan C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil worked as copyist in <em>Q&lt;U+0131&gt;z&lt;U+0131&gt;l Tatarstan</em> newspaper and studied at <a href="rabfak" class="uri" title="wikilink">rabfak</a> of the Oriental Pedagogical Institute. He became acquainted with prominent Tatar poets <a href="Qawi_N&lt;U+00E4&gt;cmi" title="wikilink">Qawi N&lt;U+00E4&gt;cmi</a>, <a href="Hadi_Taqta&lt;U+015F&gt;" title="wikilink">Hadi Taqta&lt;U+015F&gt;</a>, <a href="&lt;U+011E&gt;&lt;U+00E4&gt;del_Qutuy" title="wikilink">&lt;U+011E&gt;&lt;U+00E4&gt;del Qutuy</a> and others. Since 1924 he is a member of <em>October</em> literary society, backing <a href="Proletkult" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proletkult</a>. He is published in numerous magazines and newspapers of Kazan. Since 1924 his poetry departed from Ghisyanism and aruz, and, probably influenced by Taqta&lt;U+015F&gt;, turns to the Tatar folk verse, closer to the European than to the Oriental tradition. His first collection of verses, <em>Barab&lt;U+0131&gt;z</em> (<em>We are going</em>) was published in 1925. The most of those poems are about pre-revolutionary life. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1925-26 C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil became an instructor of <a href="Orsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orsk</a> <a href="uyezd" class="uri" title="wikilink">uyezd</a> Komsomol cell, where he visited Tatar and <a href="Kazakhs" title="wikilink">Kazakh</a> <a href="aul" title="wikilink">auls</a>, agitating for Komsomol there. In 1926 he became the member of Orenburg governorate Komsomol committee. In 1927 Musa moved to <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, where he combine his study in the <a href="Moscow_State_University" title="wikilink">Moscow State University</a> and job in <a href="Tatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatar</a>-<a href="Bashkir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bashkir</a> section of the Central Committee of Komsomol. In 1929 C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil joined <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>. The same year his second collection, <em>&lt;U+0130&gt;pt&lt;U+00E4&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;k&lt;U+00E4&gt;</em> (i.e. <em>To the Comrade</em>; <a href="Ja&lt;U+014B&gt;alif" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ja&lt;U+014B&gt;alif</a>: <em>Ipt&lt;U+0259&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;k&lt;U+0259&gt;</em>) was published. There were verses, full of optimism and admiration with the future trends. Living in Moscow, C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil met Russian poets Zharov, Bezymensky, <a href="Mikhail_Arkadyevich_Svetlov" title="wikilink">Svetlov</a>, attend <a href="Vladimir_Mayakovsky" title="wikilink">Vladimir Mayakovsky</a>'s performances. He entered <a href="Moscow_Association_of_Proletarian_Writers" title="wikilink">Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers</a> (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0410&gt;&lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+041F&gt; - MAPP), and became its third secretary and a leader of its Tatar section. Now his hero is a village fellow, striving to the new life, admiring with the &quot;voice of machines&quot;. C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil tried to find &quot;new poetic language&quot;, full or &quot;proletarian colours&quot;. However, in the end of 1920s lyricism appeared in C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's poetry.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1931 C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil graduated Literature Faculty of Moscow University. Until 1932 he was a chief editor of <em>Kecken&lt;U+0259&gt; ipt&lt;U+0259&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;l&lt;U+0259&gt;r</em>, later renamed to <em>Okt&lt;U+0259&gt;br Balas&lt;U+044C&gt;</em> (<em><a href="Little_Octobrist" title="wikilink">Little Octobrist</a></em>), the Tatar magazine for children. Then he headed the section of literature and art in the central Tatar newspaper <em>Kommunist</em>. In 1934 Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil published two collections. The first of them, <em>The Millions, Decorated with Orders</em> was devoted mostly to youth and Komsomol, whereas in the second, <em>Verses and Poems</em>, the best of his writing were collected. The mainstream lyric was full of optimism and spirits. However, many of his lyrical poems weren't published, as being in dissonance with <a href="Stalinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalinism</a>. Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil lived in the various places of the <a href="USSR" class="uri" title="wikilink">USSR</a>, combining several jobs.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1935, the first Russian translations of his poems were published. His verses, set to music, became popular Tatar songs. In 1930s C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil also translated to the <a href="Tatar_language" title="wikilink">Tatar language</a> writngs of poets of the <a href="USSR" class="uri" title="wikilink">USSR</a> peoples, such as <a href="Shota_Rustaveli" title="wikilink">Shota Rustaveli</a>, <a href="Taras_Shevchenko" title="wikilink">Taras Shevchenko</a>, <a href="Pushkin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pushkin</a>, <a href="Nekrasov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nekrasov</a>, <a href="Vladimir_Mayakovsky" title="wikilink">Mayakovsky</a> and <a href="Vasily_Lebedev-Kumach" title="wikilink">Lebedev-Kumach</a>. In the late 1930s he tended to write epic poems, such as <em>The Director and the Sun</em> (1935), <em>Cihan</em> (1935-1938), <em>The Postman</em> (1938). A a <a href="playwright" class="uri" title="wikilink">playwright</a> of <a href="Tatar_State_Opera" title="wikilink">Tatar State Opera</a> he wrote four librettos for Tatar operas, and the most prominent of them is <em>Alt&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00E4&gt;&lt;U+00E7&gt;</em> (<em>Golden Hair Maiden</em>) of <a href="N&lt;U+00E4&gt;cip_Cihanov" title="wikilink">N&lt;U+00E4&gt;cip Cihanov</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1939-1940, he became the chairman of the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> To this day Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil is regarded as one of the most significant authors in the <a href="Tatar_language" title="wikilink">Tatar language</a>.</p>

<p>After <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>'s invasion of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> in June 1941, C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil volunteered to the Red Army. Briefly graduating <a href="Political_commissar" title="wikilink">political officer</a> courses, he arrived to the <a href="Volkhov_Front" title="wikilink">Volkhov Front</a> and became <a href="war_correspondent" title="wikilink">war correspondent</a> in <em>Otvaga</em> newspaper. C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil also wrote verse, patriotic but later turns to the <em>front lyricism</em>, i.e. about feelings of war people.</p>
<p>In June 1942, C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's unit was encircled, when they tried to run a blockade he was seriously wounded, shell-shocked and captured. After months in concentration camps for Soviet prisoners-of-war, including <a href="Stalag-340" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalag-340</a> in <a href="Latvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latvia</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and <a href="Spandau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spandau</a>, C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil was transferred to <a href="D&lt;U+0119&gt;blin" class="uri" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+0119&gt;blin</a>, a fortified stronghold in <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>. There Musa met his fellow countrymen, for the Nazis were assembling prisoners of <a href="Idel-Ural" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idel-Ural</a> and Eastern nationalities in the camp. He sought out people he could trust in and together they subsequently formed a resistance group.</p>
<p>In late 1942, the Nazis started forming what they called <em>national legions</em>. Among others, <a href="Volga_Tatar_Legion" title="wikilink">the Idel-Ural legion</a> was formed in <a href="Jedlina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jedlina</a>, Poland, of prisoners-of-war belonging to the nations of the <a href="Volga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volga</a> basin. Since the majority were <a href="Volga_Tatars" title="wikilink">Volga Tatars</a>, the Germans usually called it the Volga-Tatar legion. The Nazis brainwashed the prisoners in a rabidly <a href="chauvinist" title="wikilink">chauvinistic</a> and <a href="anti-Soviet" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Soviet</a> spirit, to prepare the legionnaires for action against the <a href="Soviet_Army" title="wikilink">Soviet Army</a>. He joined the <a href="Wehrmacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wehrmacht</a> propaganda unit for the legion under the <a href="Pseudonym" title="wikilink">false name</a> Gumeroff. <a href="C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil&#39;s_group" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's group</a> set out to wreck the Nazi plans, to convince the men to use the weapons they would be supplied with against the Nazis themselves. The members of the resistance group infiltrated the editorial board of the <em>Idel-Ural</em> newspaper the German command produced, and printed and circulated anti-fascist leaflets among the legionnaires into esoteric action groups consisting of 5 men each. The very first battalion of the Volga-Tatar legion that was sent to the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Eastern front</a> mutinied, shot all the German officers, and defected to the <a href="Soviet_partisans" title="wikilink">Soviet partisans</a> in <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>.</p>
<p>In August 1943, Nazi spies managed to track down the resistance group. Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil and most of his militant comrades were seized. There followed nightmare days and nights of interrogations, torture, and more torture. The <a href="Gestapo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gestapo</a> broke his left arm and injured his kidneys. His body was covered with welts from the beatings he got with an electric cord and rubber hose. His crushed fingers were swollen and would not bend. But the poet did not give up. Behind bars he continued his fight against <a href="Nazism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazism</a>. He had only his poetry for a weapon.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="August_10" title="wikilink">August 10</a>, <a href="1943" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943</a>, he was arrested with his comrades and sent to <a href="Moabit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moabit</a> Prison in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>. He sat in a cell with <a href="Demographics_of_Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgian</a> patriot and resistance fighter <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Timmermans" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Timmermans</a>, and also with one <a href="Polish_people" title="wikilink">Polish</a> prisoner. C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil studied <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> in prison to communicate with the cellmates. As the regime was not so harsh, he managed to compile at least hundred of all his verses, composed in the prison, to the small self-made notebooks. He and his group of 12 were sentenced to death on <a href="February_12" title="wikilink">February 12</a>, <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a> and guillotined at <a href="Pl&lt;U+00F6&gt;tzensee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pl&lt;U+00F6&gt;tzensee</a> Prison, Berlin, on <a href="August_25" title="wikilink">August 25</a>.

A soldier who paused there before the next attack noticed several lines in <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a> on one of the clean pages of a book that was lying about: &quot;I am the Tatar poet Musa C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil, held in Moabit prison as a prisoner-of-war against whom political charges have been preferred, and will most likely be shot soon. If some Russian finds this note, convey my regards to my writer-friends in Moscow and break the news to my family&quot;.

They were published as two books under the title <em>Moabit D&lt;U+00E4&gt;ft&lt;U+00E4&gt;re</em> (<em>The Moabit Notebook</em>). C&lt;U+00E4&gt;lil's widow &lt;U+00C4&gt;min&lt;U+00E4&gt; Zalyalova gave the originals to the National Museum of <a href="Tatarstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatarstan</a> for safekeeping.</p>
