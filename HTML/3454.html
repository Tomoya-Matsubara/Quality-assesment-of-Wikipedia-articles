<p><strong>Alphonse &quot;Buddy&quot; Fletcher, Jr.</strong> (born 1966) is an African-American <a href="philanthropist" class="uri" title="wikilink">philanthropist</a> who had previously been a successful <a href="money_manager" title="wikilink">money manager</a>. Fletcher first became notable when employed by <a href="Kidder,_Peabody_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.</a> During this time, he had an agreement entitling him to 25% of the profits he earned for the firm. However, when he generated $25 million one year, the firm did not uphold its agreement, and Fletcher sued for racial discrimination and <a href="US$" class="uri" title="wikilink">US$</a>3 million in back pay. He eventually won an arbitration award of $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Fletcher had worked at <a href="Bear_Stearns" title="wikilink">Bear Stearns</a> before working for Kidder and founded his own firm, Fletcher Asset Management, after the dispute with Kidder Peabody. Having donated tens of millions of dollars to various charitable causes, Fletcher has become a major philanthropist. He has established several lasting legacies with his charitable efforts; two such efforts include the establishment of the <a href="Fletcher_Foundation" title="wikilink">Fletcher Foundation</a> and the endowment of a <a href="Harvard_University_Professor" title="wikilink">University Professorship</a> at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>. He has also been a serious contender for statewide public office in the United States state of <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>.</p>

<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Fletcher's first experience with investment, risk and return occurred when he was in junior high school. He and his father developed a computer program to determine dogs to invest in at the <a href="dog_racing" title="wikilink">dog racing</a> tracks. His program was able to select dogs that would win place or show, but due to the odds of the dogs it was selecting and the <a href="Commission_(remuneration)" title="wikilink">commission</a> that the <a href="race_track" title="wikilink">race track</a> extracted, his work was not profitable.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>He attended <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a> where he received an <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">A.B.</a> degree as an <a href="applied_mathematics" title="wikilink">applied mathematics</a> major in 1987.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was elected first marshall (class president) of the 1987 class.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He earned a <a href="Master&lt;U+2019&gt;s_degree" title="wikilink">Master&lt;U+2019&gt;s degree</a> in Environmental Management from the <a href="Yale_School_of_Forestry_and_Environmental_Studies" title="wikilink">Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> While an undergraduate student, he was enrolled in the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> <a href="Reserve_Officers&#39;_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> Aerospace Studies Program at the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant" title="wikilink">second lieutenant</a> and served in the United States Air Force Ready Reserve until his <a href="honorable_discharge" title="wikilink">honorable discharge</a> in 1997.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="professional-career">Professional career</h2>
<p>The United States National <a href="Defense_(military)" title="wikilink">Defense</a> budget cuts caused people to encourage Fletcher to find a private sector job despite his ROTC training. After graduating from college in 1987, he became a <a href="Trader_(finance)" title="wikilink">trader</a> for Bear Stearns.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He was subsequently hired by Kidder Peabody where he emerged as an elite trader.

<h3 id="alphonse-fletcher-vs.-kidder-peabody">Alphonse Fletcher vs. Kidder Peabody</h3>
<p>By age 25, Fletcher was Kidder's top equity trader, and he was earning $2 million a year.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> At the time, Kidder was owned by <a href="General_Electric" title="wikilink">General Electric</a> (GE).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> As part of his relationship with Kidder, the company agreed to pay him one quarter of the profits that he made for the firm, but when he earned the firm $25 million dollars, they only paid him half of the amount promised. He sued for the other half ($3 million in back pay).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In addition to the pay dispute he filed a $5 million dollar (plus <a href="punitive_damages" title="wikilink">punitive damages</a>) discrimination suit.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Fletcher claimed the firm had kept their promise to white employees and claimed <a href="racial_discrimination" title="wikilink">racial discrimination</a> because white employees were paid more generously for similar work.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Alleging a violation of State Human Rights Law, Fletcher filed a discrimination claim in the New York State Courts.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <a href="New_York_Supreme_Court,_Appellate_Division" title="wikilink">New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division</a> ruled that an arbitration panel would hear his case.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Jurisdiction in the case was a hotly contested matter. In the Individual Assignment System (IAS) of the <a href="New_York_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">New York Supreme Court</a>, Fletcher sued Kidder under the New York State Human Rights Law, alleging racial discrimination in employment in violation of Executive Law &lt;U+00A7&gt; 296(1)(a). In response, Kidder moved to stay the judicial proceedings and compel arbitration on the basis of the broad arbitration clause that they had signed during securities exchange registration applications. Fletcher contended that the <a href="Federal_Arbitration_Act" title="wikilink">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA), which preempts state law, mandated enforcement of Kidder's promise to submit &quot;controversies ... arising out of [his] employment&quot; to arbitration. The IAS court denied the motion, reasoning that &quot;it would be against public policy to contract in advance for a waiver of the right to obtain judicial redress of alleged racial discrimination.&quot; The <a href="New_York_Supreme_Court,_Appellate_Division" title="wikilink">New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division</a>, however, &quot;reversed and granted the requested relief after concluding that the FAA and the cases decided under that statute mandated enforcement of [Kidder's] arbitration agreement&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The <a href="United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> declined to hear the case.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Fletcher eventually won an arbitration award of $1.3 million.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
