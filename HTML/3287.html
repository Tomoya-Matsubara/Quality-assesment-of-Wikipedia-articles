<p>In July 1874, a select committee declared Montgomery's election to be &quot;null and void&quot;, as he had a contract for the supply of <a href="Railroad_tie" title="wikilink">railway sleepers</a> with the general government in breach of election rules. The select committee accepted that the breach was inadvertent.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Montgomery stood for re-election in the second by-election, on 10 August 1874<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and was returned unopposed.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
