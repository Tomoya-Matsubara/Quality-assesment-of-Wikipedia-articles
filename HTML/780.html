<p>The <strong>Bulldog Bash</strong> is considered to be one of Europe's most popular, annual, motorcycle festivals with a reported attendance of 50,000 people in 2007. It takes place over a weekend in mid-August, at the <a href="Shakespeare_County_Raceway" title="wikilink">Shakespeare County Raceway</a>, which is situated outside <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in England.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The event started as a small gathering organised by the <a href="Hells_Angels" title="wikilink">Hells Angels</a> motorcycle club for bikers. Since 1987, the event has grown to one of the largest motorcycle festivals in Europe, with a record 50,000 people reported to have attended in 2007.</p>
<p>It is believed that the popularity of the event is due to the organisers' philosophy of hosting a festival that meets all the criteria of their own 'perfect party', organised by bikers, for bikers.</p>
<p>The festival has been hosted at the <a href="Shakespeare_County_Raceway" title="wikilink">Shakespeare County Raceway</a> in <a href="Stratford-on-Avon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stratford-on-Avon</a> in England since 1987, and always takes place in mid August. Since its inception, it has followed largely the same format (though expanded for larger crowds and more recently included bigger name bands): providing entertainment aimed at the motorcycle riding fraternity, including live <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a>, <a href="beer" class="uri" title="wikilink">beer</a> tents, <a href="motorcycle_racing" title="wikilink">motorcycle racing</a>, <a href="drag_racing" title="wikilink">drag racing</a> &amp; <a href="stunt_riding" title="wikilink">stunt riding</a> demonstrations. <a href="Sex_industry" title="wikilink">Adult entertainment</a> traditionally features high on the bill, including <a href="Wet_T-shirt_contest" title="wikilink">Wet T-shirt contest</a>, <a href="erotic_dance" title="wikilink">erotic dance</a> shows and <a href="Toplessness" title="wikilink">topless</a> bike wash.</p>
<p>The event currently runs over four days, gates opening on Thursday, and running through Friday and Saturday and wrapping up on Sunday.</p>
<p>The USA equivalents on a much larger scale are <a href="Sturgis_Motorcycle_Rally" title="wikilink">Sturgis Motorcycle Rally</a> and <a href="Daytona_Beach_Bike_Week" title="wikilink">Daytona Beach Bike Week</a>.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-crime">Security and crime</h2>
<p>Despite the general public's association of violence and crime with the Hells Angels, the Bulldog Bash has a consistent record of causing the <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> Police little trouble, compared to other events of this scale.</p>
<p>There are no police patrolling the site (though they have a small base just off site), no personal searches conducted by police - the <a href="Hells_Angels" title="wikilink">Hells Angels</a> maintain security inside the festival grounds themselves.</p>
<p>Inspector Dave Patterson from the <a href="Warwickshire_Police" title="wikilink">Warwickshire Police</a> is quoted to have said about the <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> event: &quot;There was just four crimes reported on site and only three arrests during the four day event. Although traffic to and from the <a href="Long_Marston,_Warwickshire" title="wikilink">Long Marston</a> site was greater than normal, the traffic plan worked well.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The four crimes recorded on the <a href="Police_Media_Portal" title="wikilink">Police Media Portal</a> were all theft related.</p>
