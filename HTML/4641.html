<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>
<p>In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> including <a href="Andorra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andorra</a> who currently do not have a senior women's national football team. The country only has a national U-18 team.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The nation has not competed at the Women's World Cup.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The national team has never been ranked,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a team was not ranked in the world by FIFA in March 2012.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> While a youth national team exists,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> between 2002 and 2006, it did not play a single international match.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background-and-development">Background and development</h2>
<p>With a <a href="FIFA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIFA</a> trigramme of AND<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and having become a <a href="EFA" class="uri" title="wikilink">EFA</a> affiliated in 1996, the national association did not respond to a survey about the status of women's football in the country. In May of the the following year, the official who answered another survey from FIFA reckoned there to be 37 active female players, all described as &quot;100% beginners/amateurs&quot;. It was further suggested women's football had begun that year in Andorra and that there had been no previous interest in any women's sport. There was no participation in national or international competitions, though three women were employed in the association.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As of 2009, the programme was geared for young girls with player registration starting at the age of six. There are only six women's teams in the country, all for girls under the age of sixteen and includes a national and schools competition.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> There is also a national women's competition that took place in 2010/2011.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> 16% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 48% for youth football and 25% for infrastructure.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching, no women's football seminar held in the country and no FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
