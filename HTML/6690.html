<p><img src="Chimpanzee_congo_painting.jpg" title="fig:A painting by Congo." alt="A painting by Congo." /> <strong>Congo</strong> (1954&lt;U+2013&gt;1964) was a <a href="chimpanzee" class="uri" title="wikilink">chimpanzee</a> who learned how to draw and paint. Zoologist and surrealist painter <a href="Desmond_Morris" title="wikilink">Desmond Morris</a> first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings over two years. His style has been described as &quot;lyrical <a href="abstract_impressionism" title="wikilink">abstract impressionism</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography-and-works">Biography and works</h2>
<p>Congo was born in 1954. He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist <a href="Desmond_Morris" title="wikilink">Desmond Morris</a> offered Congo a pencil.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Morris said, &quot;He took [the pencil] and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw <a href="circle" title="wikilink">circles</a>, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Similarily, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>He soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictoral images, but usually of a vague &quot;radiating fan pattern&quot; in the <a href="abstract_impressionism" title="wikilink">abstract impressionism</a> style.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Through that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routinely painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and &quot;throw fits&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show <em><a href="Zootime" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zootime</a></em>, which was presented live from the <a href="London_Zoo" title="wikilink">London Zoo</a> by Desmond Morris.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He died at ten years of age in 1964 of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Media reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. <a href="Andalusian_people" title="wikilink">Andalusian</a> painter <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a> was reportedly a &quot;fan&quot; of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at <a href="Bonhams" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonhams</a> alongside works by <a href="Pierre-Auguste_Renoir" title="wikilink">Renoir</a> and <a href="Warhol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warhol</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; Congo's painting sold for more than expected whilst Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for US$26,000.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
