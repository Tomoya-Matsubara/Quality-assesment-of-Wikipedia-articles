<p><strong>El Greco</strong> (probably a combination of the <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Castilian</a> and the <a href="Venetian_language" title="wikilink">Venetian language</a> for &quot;The <a href="Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a>&quot;, <a href="1541" class="uri" title="wikilink">1541</a> – <a href="April_7" title="wikilink">April 7</a> <a href="1614" class="uri" title="wikilink">1614</a>) was a <a href="painting" title="wikilink">painter</a>, <a href="sculpture" title="wikilink">sculptor</a>, and <a href="architecture" title="wikilink">architect</a> of the <a href="Spanish_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Spanish Renaissance</a>. He usually signed his paintings in <a href="Greek_alphabet" title="wikilink">Greek letters</a> with his full name, <strong>Dom&lt;U+00E9&gt;nicos Theotoc&lt;U+00F3&gt;poulos</strong> (), underscoring his Greek descent.</p>
<p>El Greco was born in <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, which was at that time part of the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a>; at 26 he travelled to <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a> itself to study, then a common practice of young Greek men who wished to pursue a wider education. In 1570 he moved to <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, El Greco enriched his style with elements of <a href="Mannerism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mannerism</a> and of the <a href="Italian_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Venetian Renaissance</a>. In 1577 he emigrated to <a href="Toledo,_Spain" title="wikilink">Toledo</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best known paintings.</p>
<p>El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the <a href="20th_century" title="wikilink">20th century</a>. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both <a href="Expressionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Expressionism</a> and <a href="Cubism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cubism</a>, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as <a href="Rainer_Maria_Rilke" title="wikilink">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> and <a href="Nikos_Kazantzakis" title="wikilink">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical <a href="pigmentation" class="uri" title="wikilink">pigmentation</a>, marrying <a href="Byzantine_art" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> traditions with those of <a href="Western_civilization" title="wikilink">Western civilization</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for <em>The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception</em> El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1.5 feet &quot;because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure'&quot;. A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of <a href="Paul_C&lt;U+00E9&gt;zanne" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00E9&gt;zanne</a> and <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Picasso</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light. As Jonathan Brown notes, &quot;each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Fernando Marias and Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Bustamante Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Modern scholarly research emphasizes on the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="Harold_Wethey" title="wikilink">Harold Wethey</a> asserts that &quot;although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish <a href="mysticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">mysticism</a>&quot;. He believes that in El Greco's mature works &quot;the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality.

<h3 id="suggested-byzantine-affinities">Suggested Byzantine affinities</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> while, others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The discovery of the <em>Dormition of the Virgin</em> on <a href="Syros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syros</a>, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka &quot;far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with <a href="Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a> professors <a href="Cyril_Mango" title="wikilink">Cyril Mango</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_Jeffreys" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Jeffreys</a>, who assert that &quot;despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his <a href="Works_of_El_Greco" title="wikilink">famous paintings</a> was his signature in Greek lettering&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Nicos Hadjinicolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is &quot;neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western European</a>.

<p>The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of <a href="Platonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Platonism</a> and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of <a href="Plotinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plotinus</a> and <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius_the_Areopagite" title="wikilink">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvarez Lopera, curator at the <a href="Museo_del_Prado" title="wikilink">Museo del Prado</a>, Madrid, concludes that the presence of &quot;Byzantine memories&quot; is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He [El Greco] has discovered a realm of new possibilities. Not even he, himself, was able to exhaust them. All the generations that follow after him live in his realm. There is a greater difference between him and Titian, his master, than between him and Renoir or C&lt;U+00E9&gt;zanne.

</blockquote>
<p>To the English artist and critic <a href="Roger_Fry" title="wikilink">Roger Fry</a> in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best &quot;with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public&quot;.

<p>The early cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights.

<p>The exact number of El Greco's works has been a hotly contested issue. In 1937 a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco. Palluchini attributed to El Greco a small <a href="triptych" class="uri" title="wikilink">triptych</a> in the Galleria Estense at <a href="Modena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Modena</a> on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych (&quot;&quot;, Created by the hand of Dom&lt;U+00E9&gt;nicos).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palluchini&gt;R. Palluchini, <em>Some Early Works by El Greco</em>, 130–135</ref> Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue  with a greatly reduced corpus of materials. Whereas art historian Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cam&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor S&lt;U+0153&gt;hner, a German researcher of <a href="Spanish_art" title="wikilink">Spanish art</a>, recognized only 137.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco's .<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>Since 1962 the discovery of the <em>Dormition</em> and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and . The discovery of the <em>Dormition</em> led to the attribution of three other signed works of &quot;Dom&lt;U+00E9&gt;nicos&quot; to El Greco (<em>Modena Triptych</em>, <em>St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child</em>, and <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>) and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic – some signed, some not (such as <em>The Passion of Christ (Piet&lt;U+00E0&gt; with Angels)</em> painted in 1566),<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> – which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Even Wethey accepted that &quot;he [El Greco] probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey's catalogue  is at the centre of these disagreements.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>A few sculptures, including <em>Epimetheus and Pandora</em>, have been attributed to El Greco.

<p><strong>a.</strong>  Theotoc&lt;U+00F3&gt;poulos acquired the name &quot;El Greco&quot; in Italy, where the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of origin was a common practice.

<p><strong>c.</strong>  There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace.

Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old Fodele was (the village later changed location because of the raids of the pirates).<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65, stating his place of birth as Candia. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>d.</strong>  This document comes from the notarial archives of Candia and was published in 1962.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <em>Menegos</em> is the Venetian dialect form of , and  (=) is a Greek term for painter.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>e.</strong>  According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On <a href="December_26" title="wikilink">December 26</a>, <a href="1566" class="uri" title="wikilink">1566</a> El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a &quot;panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background&quot; (&quot;un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato&quot;) in a lottery.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The Byzantine icon by young Dom&lt;U+00E9&gt;nicos depicting the <em>Passion of Christ</em>, painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on <a href="December_27" title="wikilink">December 27</a> <a href="1566" class="uri" title="wikilink">1566</a> in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after December 27, 1566.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that El Greco left Crete in 1567.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> According to other archival material — drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan <a href="cartographer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cartographer</a> — he was in Venice by 1568.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>f.</strong>  Mancini reports that El Greco said to the Pope that if the whole work was demolished he himself would do it in a decent manner and with seemliness.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>g.</strong>  Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was 62,000.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>h.</strong> El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on <a href="June_18" title="wikilink">June 18</a>, <a href="1603" class="uri" title="wikilink">1603</a>. He agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict. He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the appraisers.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The brotherhood took advantage of this act of good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Finally, El Greco assigned his legal representation to Preboste and a friend of him, Francisco Xim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez Montero, and accepted a payment of 2,093 <a href="ducat" title="wikilink">ducats</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Jer&lt;U+00F3&gt;nima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco, and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>j.</strong>  The myth of El Greco's madness came in two versions. On the one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> On the other hand, the public and the critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would retain the image of El Greco as a &quot;mad painter&quot; and, therefore, his &quot;maddest&quot; paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his &quot;madness&quot;.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>k.</strong>  This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German <a href="psychologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychologist</a> David Kuntz.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a>.
