<p>The <strong>Falkland Islands</strong> (;  ) are an <a href="archipelago" class="uri" title="wikilink">archipelago</a> in the South <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> on the <a href="Patagonian_Shelf" title="wikilink">Patagonian Shelf</a>. The principal islands are about 300 miles (500 km) east of <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>'s southern <a href="Patagonia" title="wikilink">Patagonian</a> coast, at a latitude of about 52&lt;U+00B0&gt;S. The archipelago, with an area of 4,700 square miles (12,200 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), comprises <a href="East_Falkland" title="wikilink">East Falkland</a>, <a href="West_Falkland" title="wikilink">West Falkland</a> and 776 smaller islands. As a <a href="British_Overseas_Territories" title="wikilink">British overseas territory</a>, the Falklands have <a href="self-governing" title="wikilink">internal self-governance</a>, with the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is <a href="Stanley,_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Stanley</a>, on East Falkland.</p>
<p>Controversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a>, <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">British</a>, <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>, and <a href="Argentina" title="wikilink">Argentine</a> settlements. Britain <a href="Reassertion_of_British_sovereignty_over_the_Falkland_Islands_(1833)" title="wikilink">reasserted its rule in 1833</a>, although Argentina maintained its <a href="Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute" title="wikilink">claim</a> to the islands. In 1982, after Argentina's <a href="1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">invasion of the islands</a>, the <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a> resulted in the surrender of Argentine forces and the return of the islands to British administration.</p>
<p>The population (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily consists of native <a href="Falkland_Islanders" title="wikilink">Falkland Islanders</a>, the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, <a href="Gibraltarian_people" title="wikilink">Gibraltarian</a> and <a href="Scandinavia" title="wikilink">Scandinavian</a>. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of <a href="Saint_Helena" title="wikilink">Saint Helena</a>, and <a href="Chile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chile</a> has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the <a href="British_Nationality_(Falkland_Islands)_Act_1983" title="wikilink">British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983</a>, Falkland Islanders are legally <a href="British_nationality_law" title="wikilink">British citizens</a>.</p>
<p>The islands lie on the boundary of the <a href="Oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">subarctic and temperate maritime climate</a> zones, with both major islands having mountain ranges reaching . They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the <a href="Falkland_Islands_Government" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands Government</a>, remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>

<p>The Falkland Islands take their name from the <a href="Falkland_Sound" title="wikilink">Falkland Sound</a>, a <a href="strait" class="uri" title="wikilink">strait</a> separating the archipelago's two main islands. The name &quot;Falkland&quot; was applied to the channel by <a href="John_Strong_(mariner)" title="wikilink">John Strong</a>, captain of an <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">English</a> expedition, which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of <a href="Anthony_Cary,_5th_Viscount_of_Falkland" title="wikilink">Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland</a>, the <a href="Treasurer_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Treasurer of the Navy</a> who sponsored their journey.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> The Viscount's title originates from the town of <a href="Falkland,_Fife" title="wikilink">Falkland</a>, <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, whose name comes from &quot;folkland&quot; (land held by <a href="Anglo-Saxon_law#Folk-right_and_privilege" title="wikilink">folk-right</a>). The name was not applied to the islands until 1765, when <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">British</a> captain <a href="John_Byron" title="wikilink">John Byron</a> of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>, claimed them for <a href="George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George III</a> as &quot;Falkland's Islands&quot;.<ref>See:</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> The term &quot;Falklands&quot; is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Spanish name for the archipelago, <em>Islas Malvinas</em>, derives from the French <em>&lt;U+00CE&gt;les Malouines</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;the name given the islands by <a href="Kingdom_of_France" title="wikilink">French</a> explorer <a href="Louis-Antoine_de_Bougainville" title="wikilink">Louis-Antoine de Bougainville</a> in 1764. Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of <a href="Saint-Malo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Malo</a> (the point of departure for his ships and colonists).<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> The port, located in the <a href="Brittany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brittany</a> region of western France, was in turn named after <a href="Malo_(saint)" title="wikilink">St. Malo</a> (or Maclou), the Christian <a href="Evangelism" title="wikilink">evangelist</a> who founded the city.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the twentieth session of the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a>, the <a href="United_Nations_Fourth_Committee" title="wikilink">Fourth Committee</a> determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as <em>Falkland Islands (Malvinas)</em>. In Spanish, the territory was designated as <em>Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands)</em>. The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is <em>Falkland Islands (Malvinas)</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Although <a href="Fuegians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fuegians</a> from <a href="Patagonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patagonia</a> may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the islands were uninhabited at the time of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether these early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a>'s and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the island's water and game.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>.</ref></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of <a href="Port_Louis,_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Port Louis</a> on <a href="East_Falkland" title="wikilink">East Falkland</a> by French captain <a href="Louis_Antoine_de_Bougainville" title="wikilink">Louis Antoine de Bougainville</a>, and the 1766 foundation of <a href="Port_Egmont" title="wikilink">Port Egmont</a> on <a href="Saunders_Island,_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Saunders Island</a> by British captain <a href="John_MacBride_(Royal_Navy_officer)" title="wikilink">John MacBride</a>. Whether the settlements were aware of each other's existence or not, is subject to debate among historians.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony <a href="Puerto_Soledad" title="wikilink">Puerto Soledad</a> the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered Port Egmont; an <a href="Falklands_Crisis_(1770)" title="wikilink">imminent war</a>, caused by <a href="Capture_of_Port_Egmont" title="wikilink">Spain's capture of the port</a> in 1770, was avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's <a href="Viceroyalty_of_the_R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_de_la_Plata" title="wikilink">Viceroyalty of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata</a> became the only governmental presence in the territory. <a href="West_Falkland" title="wikilink">West Falkland</a> was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the <a href="British_invasions_of_the_R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_de_la_Plata" title="wikilink">British invasions of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata</a>, caused by the ongoing <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a> in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for <a href="gaucho" title="wikilink">gauchos</a> and fishermen who remained voluntarily.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships; its political status was undisputed until 1820, when Colonel <a href="David_Jewett" title="wikilink">David Jewett</a>, an American <a href="privateer" class="uri" title="wikilink">privateer</a> working for the <a href="United_Provinces_of_the_R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_de_la_Plata" title="wikilink">United Provinces of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata</a>, informed anchored ships about <a href="Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">Buenos Aires</a>' 1816 claim to Spain's territories in the South Atlantic.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants, in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German-born merchant <a href="Luis_Vernet" title="wikilink">Luis Vernet</a> permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago. Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was secure enough to bring settlers and form a permanent colony.<ref>See:</p></li>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829, and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers. Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights caused <a href="Falklands_Expedition" title="wikilink">a raid</a> by the <a href="United_States_Ship" title="wikilink">American warship</a> <a href="USS_Lexington_(1825)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Lexington</em></a> in 1831, when <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> commander <a href="Silas_Duncan" title="wikilink">Silas Duncan</a> &quot;declared the island government at an end&quot;.</p></li>

<p>Buenos Aires attempted to retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who <a href="Reassertion_of_British_sovereignty_over_the_Falkland_Islands_(1833)" title="wikilink">reasserted Britain's rule</a>. The <a href="Argentine_Confederation" title="wikilink">Argentine Confederation</a> (headed by Buenos Aires Governor <a href="Juan_Manuel_de_Rosas" title="wikilink">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a>) protested Britain's actions, and Argentine governments since then continue to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area &quot;a kind of no man's land&quot;. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman <a href="Matthew_Brisbane" title="wikilink">Matthew Brisbane</a>, returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho <a href="Antonio_Rivero" title="wikilink">Antonio Rivero</a> led a group of &quot;malcontents&quot; to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a <a href="Crown_colony" title="wikilink">Crown colony</a>, and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant <a href="Samuel_Fisher_Lafone" title="wikilink">Samuel Lafone</a> began a venture to encourage British colonisation.<ref>See:</p>

<li><p>.</ref></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Stanley,_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Stanley</a>, as Port Jackson was soon renamed, officially became the seat of government in 1845. Early in its history, Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo-shipping losses; only in emergencies would ships rounding <a href="Cape_Horn" title="wikilink">Cape Horn</a> stop at the port. Nevertheless, the Falklands' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the &quot;Wrecking Trade&quot;, the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes. Aside from this trade, commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low-value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures. Economic growth began only after the <a href="Falkland_Islands_Holdings" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands Company</a>, which bought out Lafone's failing enterprise in 1851, successfully introduced <a href="Cheviot_sheep" title="wikilink">Cheviot sheep</a> for wool farming, spurring other farms to follow suit.<ref name="Bernhardson 2011 loc = Stanley and Vicinity: History">See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> The high cost of importing materials, combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages, meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive. After 1870, the ship repair trade declined as the replacement of sail ships by <a href="steamship" title="wikilink">steamships</a> was exacerbated by the low cost of coal in South America; by 1914, with the opening of the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a>, the trade effectively ended. In 1881, the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain. For more than a century, the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago; in addition, it owned most housing in Stanley, which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>In the first half of the 20th century, the Falklands served an important role in Britain's territorial claims to <a href="Subantarctic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subantarctic</a> islands and a section of <a href="Antarctica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antarctica</a>. The Falklands governed these territories as the <a href="Falkland_Islands_Dependencies" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands Dependencies</a> starting in 1908, and retained them until their dissolution in 1985. The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic. In the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> <a href="Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> in December 1914, a Royal Navy fleet defeated an <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Imperial German</a> squadron. In the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, following the December 1939 <a href="Battle_of_the_River_Plate" title="wikilink">Battle of the River Plate</a>, the battle-damaged <a href="HMS_Exeter_(68)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Exeter</em></a> steamed to the Falklands for repairs. In 1942, fear of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago caused a battalion en route to <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> to be redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison. After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina.</p>
<p>Simmering tensions between the UK and Argentina increased during the second half of the century, when Argentine President <a href="Juan_Per&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Juan Per&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> asserted sovereignty over the archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on <a href="decolonisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">decolonisation</a> which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position. In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK Parliament</a>, and tensions between the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.</p>
<p>Concerned at the expense of maintaining the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early <a href="Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Thatcher government</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">an armed conflict</a> when Argentina <a href="1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">invaded the Falklands</a> and other <a href="South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands" title="wikilink">British territories in the South Atlantic</a>, briefly <a href="Occupation_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">occupying them</a> until a UK <a href="Expeditionary_warfare" title="wikilink">expeditionary force</a> retook the territories in June.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building <a href="RAF_Mount_Pleasant" title="wikilink">RAF Mount Pleasant</a> and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Due to the large number of <a href="Demining" title="wikilink">deminer</a> casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Based on <a href="Edward_Shackleton,_Baron_Shackleton" title="wikilink">Lord Shackleton</a>'s recommendations, the Falklands diversified from a sheep-based monoculture into an economy of tourism and, with the establishment of the Falklands <a href="Exclusive_Economic_Zone" title="wikilink">Exclusive Economic Zone</a>, fisheries. The road network was also made more extensive, and the construction of RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access to <a href="Flight_length" title="wikilink">long haul</a> flights. Oil exploration has also begun, with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits in the Falklands basin.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009, in accordance with the UK's obligations under the <a href="Ottawa_Treaty" title="wikilink">Ottawa Treaty</a>, and <a href="Sapper_Hill" title="wikilink">Sapper Hill</a> Corral was cleared of mines in 2012, allowing access to an important historical landmark for the first time in 30 years.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Argentina and the UK re-established diplomatic relations in 1990; relations have since deteriorated as neither can agree on the terms of future sovereignty discussions.<ref>See:</p>

The islands are predominantly mountainous and hilly, with the major exception the depressed plains of <a href="Lafonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lafonia</a> (a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland). The Falklands are <a href="continental_crust" title="wikilink">continental crust</a> fragments resulting from the break-up of <a href="Gondwana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondwana</a> and the opening of the South Atlantic that began 130 million years ago.

</ul>
<p>The Falklands lie approximately at latitude  &lt;U+2013&gt;  and longitude  &lt;U+2013&gt; . The archipelago's two main islands are separated by the Falkland Sound, and its deep coastal indentations form <a href="natural_harbour" title="wikilink">natural harbours</a>.<ref>See:</p>
<ul>

Outside of these significant settlements is the area colloquially known as &quot;Camp&quot;, which is derived from the Spanish term for countryside (<em>Campo</em>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="Climate_of_the_Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">climate of the islands</a> is cold, windy and humid <a href="Oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">maritime</a>. Daily weather variability is normal throughout the archipelago. Rainfall is common over half of the year, averaging  in Stanley, and sporadic light snowfall occurs nearly all year. The temperature is generally between 21.1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (70 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) and -11.1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (12 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) in Stanley, but can vary to 9 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (48 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) early in the year and -1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (30 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) in July. Strong <a href="Westerlies" title="wikilink">westerly winds</a> and cloudy skies are common. Although numerous storms are recorded each month, conditions are normally calm.</p>

<p>The Falkland Islands are a <a href="Biogeography" title="wikilink">biogeographical</a> part of the mild <a href="Antarctic_ecozone" title="wikilink">Antarctic zone</a>, with strong connections to the flora and fauna of Patagonia in mainland South America.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Land birds make up most of the Falklands' <a href="avifauna" class="uri" title="wikilink">avifauna</a>; 63 species breed on the islands, including 16 <a href="Endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a> species. There is also abundant <a href="arthropod" class="uri" title="wikilink">arthropod</a> diversity on the islands. The Falklands' flora consists of 163 native <a href="Vascular_plant" title="wikilink">vascular species</a>. The islands' only native mammal, the <a href="warrah" class="uri" title="wikilink">warrah</a> (or Falkland Islands fox), was hunted to extinction by European settlers.</p>
<p>The islands are frequented by <a href="marine_mammal" title="wikilink">marine mammals</a>, such as the <a href="southern_elephant_seal" title="wikilink">southern elephant seal</a> and the <a href="South_American_fur_seal" title="wikilink">South American fur seal</a>, and various types of <a href="cetacean" title="wikilink">cetaceans</a>; offshore islands house the rare <a href="striated_caracara" title="wikilink">striated caracara</a>.

The detrimental impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain, remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes, rabbits and rats. Endemic land animals have been the most affected by introduced species. The extent of <a href="Human_impact_on_the_environment" title="wikilink">human impact</a> on the Falklands is unclear, since there is little long-term data on habitat change.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
