<h2 id="architecture-and-layout">Architecture and layout</h2>
<p>Designed by <a href="Sancton_Wood" title="wikilink">Sancton Wood</a> (the architect also of <a href="Ipswich_railway_station" title="wikilink">Ipswich</a> and <a href="Cambridge_railway_station" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> railway stations as well as many stations in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, the principal of which is <a href="Heuston_Station" title="wikilink">Heuston Station</a>, <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>), the station was formally inaugurated in November 1847, eleven months after the opening of the <a href="Eastern_Union_Railway" title="wikilink">Eastern Union Railway</a>'s line from <a href="Ipswich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ipswich</a>.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy feature of the station, which is constructed of red brick with stone dressings, is a pair of towers (originally linked by an overall roof, removed in 1893) on either side of the tracks at the eastern end of the layout. As first built – as a terminus – the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to <a href="Newmarket" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newmarket</a> in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains from Ipswich) and Platform 2 (called at by those heading east).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>, has been credited to <a href="Frederick_Barnes" title="wikilink">Frederick Barnes</a> and Charles Russell.</p>
<h2 id="derailment">Derailment</h2>
<p>Due to the freight train derailment on a bridge near Ely, trains to Peterborough from London terminate at Bury St Edmunds with a replacement bus service in operation</p>
