<p><strong>Nicolas Steno</strong> ( 1 January 1638 &lt;U+2013&gt; 25 November 1686<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> ) was a <a href="Danish_people" title="wikilink">Danish</a> Catholic <a href="List_of_Roman_Catholic_cleric&lt;U+2013&gt;scientists" title="wikilink">bishop and scientist</a> and a pioneer in both <a href="anatomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">anatomy</a> and geology. Steno was trained in the classical texts on science; however, by 1659 he seriously questioned accepted knowledge of the natural world.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Importantly he questioned explanations for tear production, the idea that fossils grew in the ground and explanations of rock formation. His investigations and his subsequent conclusions on fossils and rock formation have led scholars to consider him one of the founders of modern <a href="stratigraphy" class="uri" title="wikilink">stratigraphy</a> and modern geology.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Born to a Lutheran family, Steno converted to Catholicism in 1667. After his conversion, his interest for natural sciences rapidly waned giving way to his interest in theology.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> At the beginning of 1675, he decided to become a priest. Four months after, he was <a href="Priesthood_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">ordained</a> in the Catholic clergy in Easter 1675. As a clergyman, he was later appointed by <a href="Pope_Innocent_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent XI</a> <a href="Apostolic_Vicariate_of_Northern_Germany" title="wikilink">Vicar Apostolic of Nordic Missions</a> and <a href="Titopolis" title="wikilink">Titular Bishop of Titopolis</a>. Steno played an active role in the <a href="Counter-Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Counter-Reformation</a> in Northern Germany. He was <a href="Veneration" title="wikilink">venerated as a saint</a> after his death and the <a href="Canonization" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic canonization process</a> was begun in 1938. <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a> <a href="beatification" title="wikilink">beatified</a> Steno in 1988.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

In 1654&lt;U+2013&gt;1655, 240 pupils of his school died because of the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">plague</a>. Across the street lived <a href="Peder_Griffenfeld" title="wikilink">Peder Schumacher</a> (who would offer Steno a post as professor in Copenhagen in 1671). At the age of 19, Steno entered the <a href="University_of_Copenhagen" title="wikilink">University of Copenhagen</a> to pursue medical studies.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> After completing his university education, Steno set out to travel through Europe; in fact, he would be on the move for the rest of his life. In the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany he came into contact with prominent physicians and scientists. These influences led him to use his own powers of observation to make important scientific discoveries. At a time when scientific questions were mostly answered by appeal to ancient authorities, Steno was bold enough to trust his own eyes, even when his observations differed from traditional doctrines.</p>

<p>During his stay in Amsterdam, Steno discovered a previously undescribed structure, the &quot;<em><a href="Parotid_duct" title="wikilink">ductus stenonianus</a></em>&quot; (the duct of the <a href="Parotid_gland" title="wikilink">parotid salivary gland</a>) in sheep, dog and rabbit heads. A dispute with Blasius over credit for the discovery arose, but Steno's name remained associated with this structure known today as the <a href="parotid_duct" title="wikilink">Stensen's duct</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In Leiden, Steno studied the boiled <a href="heart" class="uri" title="wikilink">heart</a> of a cow, and determined that it was an ordinary <a href="muscle" class="uri" title="wikilink">muscle</a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and not the center of warmth as <a href="Galenus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galenus</a> and Descartes believed.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="paleontology">Paleontology</h3>
<p>In October 1666 two fishermen caught a huge female <a href="shark" class="uri" title="wikilink">shark</a> near the town of <a href="Livorno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livorno</a>, and <a href="Ferdinando_II_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Ferdinando II de' Medici</a>, Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steno. Steno <a href="dissection" title="wikilink">dissected</a> the head and published his findings in 1667. He noted that the <a href="Shark_tooth" title="wikilink">shark's teeth</a> bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling <em>glossopetrae</em> or &quot;tongue stones&quot;. Ancient authorities, such as the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> author <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a>, in his <em><a href="Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="wikilink">Naturalis Historia</a></em>, had suggested that these stones fell from the sky or from the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a>. Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a> naturally grew in the rocks. Steno's contemporary <a href="Athanasius_Kircher" title="wikilink">Athanasius Kircher</a>, for example, attributed fossils to a &quot;lapidifying virtue diffused through the whole body of the geocosm&quot;, considered an inherent characteristic of the earth &lt;U+2013&gt; an <a href="Aristotelianism" title="wikilink">Aristotelian</a> approach. <a href="Fabio_Colonna" title="wikilink">Fabio Colonna</a>, however, had already shown in a convincing way that <em>glossopetrae</em> are shark teeth,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> in his treaty <em>De glossopetris dissertatio</em> published in 1616.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Steno added to Colonna's theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae and living sharks' teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form, using the contemporary <a href="Corpuscularianism" title="wikilink">corpuscular theory of matter</a>.</p>
<p>Steno's work on shark teeth led him to the question of how any solid object could come to be found inside another solid object, such as a rock or a layer of rock. The &quot;solid bodies within solids&quot; that attracted Steno's interest included not only fossils, as we would define them today, but minerals, crystals, encrustations, veins, and even entire rock layers or <a href="stratum" title="wikilink">strata</a>. He published his geologic studies in <em>De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus</em>, or <em>Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid</em> in 1669. This book was his last scientific work of note.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|<a href="Leibnitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leibnitz</a> came to know and esteem Steno in Hannover and expressed deep regrets that Steno had abandoned his earlier studies.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>|group=notes}} Steno was not the first to identify fossils as being from living organisms; his contemporaries <a href="Robert_Hooke" title="wikilink">Robert Hooke</a> and <a href="John_Ray" title="wikilink">John Ray</a> also argued that fossils were the remains of once-living organisms.</p>

Rom&lt;U+00E9&gt; de l'Isle</a>. Steno's ideas still form the basis of stratigraphy and were key in the development of <a href="James_Hutton" title="wikilink">James Hutton</a>'s theory of <a href="James_Hutton#Search_for_evidence" title="wikilink">infinitely repeating cycles</a> of seabed deposition, uplifting, erosion, and submersion.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Steno's landmark theory that the fossil record was a chronology of different living creatures in different eras was a <em><a href="sine_qua_non" title="wikilink">sine qua non</a></em> for Darwin's theory of <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="crystallography">Crystallography</h3>

<p>Steno gave the first accurate observations on a type of crystal in his 1669 book <em>&quot;De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The principle in <a href="crystallography" class="uri" title="wikilink">crystallography</a>, known simply as <em>Steno's law</em>, or <em>Steno's law of constant angles</em>, states that the angles between corresponding faces on crystals are the same for all specimens of the same mineral. Steno's seminal work paved the way for the law of the rationality of the <a href="Crystal_system" title="wikilink">crystallographic indices</a> of French mineralogist <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Just_Ha&lt;U+00FC&gt;y" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Just Ha&lt;U+00FC&gt;y</a> in 1801.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This fundamental breakthrough formed the basis of all subsequent inquiries into <a href="crystal_structure" title="wikilink">crystal structure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="religious-studies">Religious studies</h2>
<p>Steno's questioning mind also influenced his religious views. Having been brought up in the <a href="Lutheran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a> faith, he nevertheless questioned its teachings, something which became a burning issue when confronted with Roman Catholicism while studying in <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a>. After making comparative theological studies, including reading the Church Fathers and by using his natural observational skills, he decided that Catholicism, rather than Lutheranism, provided more sustenance for his constant inquisitiveness. In 1667, Steno converted to Catholicism on <a href="All_Souls&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">All Souls' Day</a> when Lavinia Cenami Arnolfini, a noblewoman of <a href="Lucca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucca</a>, insisted.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Steno traveled to Hungary, Austria and in Spring 1670 he arrived in Amsterdam. There he met with old friends <a href="Jan_Swammerdam" title="wikilink">Jan Swammerdam</a> and <a href="Reinier_de_Graaf" title="wikilink">Reinier de Graaf</a>. With <a href="Anna_Maria_van_Schurman" title="wikilink">Anna Maria van Schurman</a> and <a href="Antoinette_Bourignon" title="wikilink">Antoinette Bourignon</a> he discussed scientific and religious topics. The following quote is from a 1673 speech:</p>

<p>It is not clear if he met <a href="Nicolaes_Witsen" title="wikilink">Nicolaes Witsen</a>, but he did read Witsen's book on shipbuilding. In 1671 he accepted the post of professor of anatomy in the University of Copenhagen,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> but promised <a href="Cosimo_III_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Cosimo III de' Medici</a> he would return when he was appointed tutor to <a href="Ferdinando_III_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Ferdinando III de' Medici</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1675, Steno decided to continue his theological studies, which he had begun even before his conversion, toward his ordination to the priesthood.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> After only 4 months, he was ordained priest and celebrated his first mass on 13 April 1675 in the Basilica of the <a href="Santissima_Annunziata,_Florence" title="wikilink">Santissima Annunziata</a> in Florence at the age of 37.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="Athanasius_Kircher" title="wikilink">Athanasius Kircher</a> expressly asked what were the reasons why he decided to become priest.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Steno had left natural sciences for education and theology and became one of the leading figures in the <a href="Counter-Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Counter-Reformation</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Upon request of Duke <a href="John_Frederick,_Duke_of_Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg" title="wikilink">Johann Friedrich of Hanover</a>, <a href="Pope_Innocent_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent XI</a> made him <a href="Apostolic_Vicariate_of_Northern_Germany#Vicars_Apostolic_for_the_Nordic_Missions" title="wikilink">Vicar Apostolic for the Nordic Missions</a> on 21 August 1677.

<p>In 1683, Steno resigned as auxiliary bishop after an argument about the election of the new bishop, <a href="Maximilian_Henry_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Maximilian Henry of Bavaria</a> and moved in 1684 to <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> There Steno became involved again in the study of the brain and the nerve system with an old friend <a href="Dirck_Kerckring" title="wikilink">Dirck Kerckring</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Steno was invited to <a href="Schwerin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schwerin</a>, when it became clear he was not accepted in Hamburg. Steno dressed like a poor man in an old cloak. He drove in an open carriage in snow and rain. Living four days a week on bread and beer, he became emaciated.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> When Steno had fulfilled his mission, some years of difficult tasks, he wanted to go back to Italy. Before he could return, Steno became severely ill, his belly swelling day by day. Steno died in Germany, after much suffering. His corpse was shipped to Florence by Kerckring upon request of <a href="Cosimo_III_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Cosimo III de' Medici</a> and buried in the <a href="Basilica_of_San_Lorenzo,_Florence" title="wikilink">Basilica of San Lorenzo</a> close to his protectors, the <a href="De&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">De' Medici</a> family.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In 1946 his grave was opened,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> and the corpse was reburied after a procession through the streets of the city.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>After his death in 1686, Steno was venerated as a saint in the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Hildesheim" title="wikilink">diocese of Hildesheim</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Steno's piety and virtue have been evaluated with a view to an eventual <a href="canonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">canonization</a>.

His remains were placed in a lateral chapel of the church that received the name of <em>&quot;Capella Stenoniana&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He was <a href="Beatification" title="wikilink">declared &quot;beatus&quot;</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the third of four steps to being declared a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; by <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a> in 1988.
