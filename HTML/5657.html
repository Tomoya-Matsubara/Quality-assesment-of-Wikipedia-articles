<p>&quot;<strong>Best Thing I Never Had</strong>&quot; is a song recorded by the <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">American</a> singer <a href="Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Knowles" title="wikilink">Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles</a> for her fourth studio album, <em><a href="4_(Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Knowles_album)" title="wikilink">4</a></em> (2011). It was released by <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a> on June 1, 2011, as the second single from the album. &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was composed by <a href="Patrick_M._Smith" title="wikilink">Patrick &quot;J.

Recorded and produced at MSR Studio and <a href="KMA_Music" title="wikilink">KMA Studio</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, the song was originally not written as a <a href="Ballad_(music)" title="wikilink">ballad</a>, but was inspired by the drumming on <a href="Doug_E._Fresh" title="wikilink">Doug E. Fresh</a>'s 1985 single &quot;<a href="The_Show_(Doug_E._Fresh_song)" title="wikilink">The Show</a>&quot;. Knowles said that anyone, regardless of gender, should be able to relate to the song.</p>
<p>A <a href="Pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>-<a href="Contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a> song, the subjects of &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize the potential for a happy life with her. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a sequel to Knowles' 2006 single &quot;<a href="Irreplaceable" class="uri" title="wikilink">Irreplaceable</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the two songs are thematically similar. They praised Knowles' vocal delivery as well as the openness of the song's message; &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was deemed to have strong radio appeal. However, some lyrics, including &quot;showed your ass&quot; and &quot;Sucks to be you right now&quot;, were criticized. The ballad was also likened to <a href="Vanessa_Carlton" title="wikilink">Vanessa Carlton</a>'s 2002 single &quot;<a href="A_Thousand_Miles" title="wikilink">A Thousand Miles</a>&quot; (2002).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; finds Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; mining the same kind of girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help <em>4</em> join the rest of Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s discography in multiplatinum land.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
<p>The music video begins with Knowles preparing herself for her wedding ceremony. She is in her boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Knowles looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming the subject of the song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Knowles playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Knowles in high school are shown. Knowles is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Knowles and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Knowles alone on the dance floor.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The video then returns to the present, with Knowles in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Knowles and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Knowles looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
