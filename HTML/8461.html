<p>Sanchez was well regarded upon his arrival at USC.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He did not play during his freshman year, and instead took a <a href="Redshirt_(college_sports)" title="wikilink">redshirt</a> season.

<p>In April 2006, Sanchez was arrested after a female USC student accused him of <a href="sexual_assault" title="wikilink">sexual assault</a>. He was released from jail the following day and suspended, but on June 3, 2006, the <a href="Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County District Attorney</a>'s office announced no charges would be filed, and Sanchez was reinstated, remaining subject to team-related discipline for underage drinking and using fake identification on the night he was arrested.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>For the <a href="2006_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>, Sanchez competed for the starting quarterback position; however, once junior <a href="John_David_Booty" title="wikilink">John David Booty</a> underwent back surgery after the first day of spring practice, Sanchez ran the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recuperated. Coaches stated Booty would be regarded as the starting quarterback when he returned for fall training camp.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> During the 2006 season Sanchez played in 6 games completing 3 of 7 passes for 63 yards and 1 interception. He also saw playing time in <a href="2006_USC_Trojans_football_team" title="wikilink">USC's</a> games against Arizona, <a href="2006_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, and <a href="2006_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a> but he did not throw a pass.</p>

Mid-season, Sanchez was moved up to starting quarterback for the game against <a href="Arizona_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Arizona</a> after Booty suffered a broken finger in his throwing hand during a 24–23 upset loss to <a href="2007_Stanford_Cardinal_football_team" title="wikilink">Stanford</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20–13 victory, overcoming a shaky first half where he threw two key interceptions, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime. During the second half, Sanchez completed 11 of 15 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown and had a key 10-yard run for a first down, ultimately finishing the game 19 for 31 passing with 130 yards and averaged 4.2 yards a play for one touchdown, two interceptions, and was <a href="Quarterback_sack" title="wikilink">sacked</a> three times.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>With Booty still recovering, USC elected to start Sanchez for a second straight week, this time at <a href="2007_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a>; he made significant improvements, completing 21 of 38 passes for 235 yards and four touchdowns and no interceptions.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 27, Sanchez started for the final time in place of the injured Booty, at an away game against <a href="2007_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>. The game resulted in a 24–17 defeat for USC, with Sanchez having two passes intercepted by Oregon <a href="Safety_(American_football_position)" title="wikilink">safety</a> Matthew Harper in the second half. The first interception led to a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave Oregon a 14 point lead; the second interception ended USC's final chance for a comeback.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He publicly accepted the blame for the loss.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The following week, against <a href="2007_Oregon_State_Beavers_football_team" title="wikilink">Oregon State</a>, Booty returned as USC's starting quarterback, with Sanchez resuming his position as Booty's backup.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Sanchez passed for 695 yards and seven touchdowns with five interceptions over the season.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Sanchez started only three games for the Trojans in the 2007 season.</p>

<p>Sanchez entered spring practice after the <a href="2008_USC_Trojans_football_team" title="wikilink">2008 season</a> as the front-runner to take over the starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from <a href="Arkansas_Razorbacks" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a>-transfer and former Razorback starter <a href="Mitch_Mustain" title="wikilink">Mitch Mustain</a> and redshirt freshman <a href="Aaron_Corp" title="wikilink">Aaron Corp</a>; Mustain, like Sanchez a year earlier, was the top quarterback in the nation coming out of high school in 2006.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By the end of spring practice, the USC coaching staff announced that Sanchez would be the designated starting quarterback going into fall camp.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez suffered a dislocated left kneecap while warming up for practice; trainers were able to immediately put the kneecap back into place.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against <a href="University_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> on the final scrimmage of fall camp.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks under Carroll&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Carson_Palmer" title="wikilink">Carson Palmer</a>, <a href="Matt_Leinart" title="wikilink">Matt Leinart</a> and Booty&lt;U+2014&gt;who wished him well and offered general advice.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>When Sanchez was elevated to prominence at USC, he found himself a symbol of Mexican-American identity and a role model for children.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Being at USC put him in the center of the spotlight in Los Angeles, a metropolitan area populated with more than 4.6 million <a href="Hispanics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispanics</a>, three-quarters of whom are Mexican.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> He began getting attention from the media in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as <a href="Jim_Plunkett" title="wikilink">Jim Plunkett</a>, <a href="Joe_Kapp" title="wikilink">Joe Kapp</a>, <a href="Jeff_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jeff Garcia</a>, <a href="Tony_Romo" title="wikilink">Tony Romo</a>, and <a href="Marc_Bulger" title="wikilink">Marc Bulger</a>, unlike his predecessors, Sanchez was a third-generation, full-blooded Mexican-American.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> USC fans began playing up Sanchez' ethnicity by wearing items such as <a href="sarape" title="wikilink">sarapes</a>, <a href="lucha_libre" title="wikilink">lucha libre</a> masks and homemade &quot;&lt;U+00A1&gt;Viva Sanchez!&quot; T-shirts.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> His rise to fame within the Mexican-American community was compared to that of boxer <a href="Oscar_De_La_Hoya" title="wikilink">Oscar De La Hoya</a> and baseball pitcher <a href="Fernando_Valenzuela#Fernandomania" title="wikilink">Fernando Valenzuela</a>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>During his first two games as a starter in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom-made <a href="mouthguard" title="wikilink">mouthpiece</a> that featured the colors of the <a href="Mexican_flag" title="wikilink">Mexican flag</a> in honor of his heritage.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Although little noticed during his first game against Arizona, it became a prominent issue after his nationally-televised game against Notre Dame.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> An item that Sanchez wore because he thought it was &quot;cool&quot; became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of solidarity&lt;U+2014&gt;Sanchez publicly accepting his roots; for detractors, the gesture symbolized radical activism.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Sanchez, who was born and raised in the U.S., reportedly received letters urging him to go back to Mexico.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Sanchez himself stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that.
