<p>The southerly flow of the river continues through <a href="Griggs_County,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Griggs County, North Dakota</a> and <a href="Barnes_County,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Barnes County, North Dakota</a> before it turns in a northeastward direction near <a href="Lisbon,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Lisbon, North Dakota</a>. The river forms Lake Astabula behind the Baldhill Dam north of <a href="Valley_City,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Valley City, North Dakota</a>.</p>
<p>From Lisbon, the river crosses the Sheyenne National Grassland, and enters <a href="Cass_County,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Cass County, North Dakota</a> near the city of <a href="Kindred,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Kindred, North Dakota</a>. This stretch is designated a <a href="National_Wild_and_Scenic_River" title="wikilink">National Wild and Scenic River</a> and is popular with canoeists and outdoor enthusiasts. From Kindred, the river flows north-northeastward through the fertile plains of the <a href="Red_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Red River Valley</a> of the North.</p>
<p>The character of the river changes as it leaves the sandy grasslands and picks up the fertile clay soil of the Red River Valley. Previously, the river posed a flooding hazard to cities such as <a href="West_Fargo,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">West Fargo, North Dakota</a> and <a href="Harwood,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Harwood, North Dakota</a>,&lt;U+3000&gt;where it joins the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River of the North</a> and flows north to <a href="Lake_Winnipeg" title="wikilink">Lake Winnipeg</a> in <a href="Manitoba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manitoba</a> Province of <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. However, due to a diversion canal completed near <a href="Horace,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Horace, North Dakota</a>, the major Sheyenne River cities fared well in the <a href="Red_River_Flood,_1997" title="wikilink">Red River Flood, 1997</a>, which devastated the cities of <a href="Grand_Forks,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Grand Forks, North Dakota</a> and <a href="East_Grand_Forks,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">East Grand Forks, Minnesota</a>.</p>
