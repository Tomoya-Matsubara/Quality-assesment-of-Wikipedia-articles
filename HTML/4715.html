<p><strong>Vladimir Haensel</strong> (1 September, 1914 &lt;U+2013&gt; 15 December, 2002) was an American <a href="chemical_engineer" title="wikilink">chemical engineer</a> who invented the <a href="platforming" class="uri" title="wikilink">platforming</a> process - a <em>plat</em>inum catalytic process for re<em>forming</em> petroleum hydrocarbons into gasoline. In addition, he was influential in the creation of <a href="catalytic_converter" title="wikilink">catalytic converters</a> for automobiles.</p>

<p>Haensel was born 1 September 1914 in <a href="Freiburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freiburg</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, but grew up in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> where his father <a href="Paul_Haensel" title="wikilink">Paul Haensel</a> was a university professor of <a href="economics" class="uri" title="wikilink">economics</a>. He came to the USA in 1930 when his father took up an academic position. He received a <a href="BS" class="uri" title="wikilink">BS</a> degree in general <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a> from <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a>, and a Master's in <a href="chemical_engineering" title="wikilink">chemical engineering</a> from <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 1937, joining the <a href="UOP_LLC" title="wikilink">Universal Oil Products Company</a> (UOP) the same year. While there he worked for a <a href="Ph.D." class="uri" title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> in <a href="chemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemistry</a> from Northwestern University, which was awarded in 1941. In UOP he progressed to become vice-president and director of research (1969) and vice-president for science and technology (1972-79). In 1980 he became professor of chemical engineering at the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, a position he held until his death, on 15 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Hertha Skala Haensel.</p>

<p>Haensel worked on surface <a href="catalyst" title="wikilink">catalysts</a>, patenting various methods for improving chemical processes in the oil industry. <a href="Platinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Platinum</a> was known to chemists as a catalyst, but was considered too expensive for industrial use. Haensel, however, understood that only the surface mattered, so produced ceramic supports with tiny amounts of platinum metal on the surface, eventually showing that 0.01 % could be effective. It has since been realised that the platinum was in the form of <a href="nanoparticle" title="wikilink">nanoparticles</a>, long before this idea was common. The metal combined with the acid surface of <a href="alumina" class="uri" title="wikilink">alumina</a> to carry out two chemical processes, resulting in the production of <a href="gasoline" class="uri" title="wikilink">gasoline</a> with a higher <a href="octane_rating" title="wikilink">octane rating</a>. At that time, octane rating was improved by the addition of <a href="anti-knock_agent" title="wikilink">anti-knock agents</a> such as <a href="tetra-ethyl_lead" title="wikilink">tetra-ethyl lead</a>. The development of the platforming process allowed the eventual removal of lead from gasoline. In addition, <a href="hydrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> was produced, which was valuable in itself but also helped to remove <a href="sulfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">sulfur</a>, giving a cleaner, more <a href="environmentally_friendly" title="wikilink">environmentally friendly</a> process.</p>
<p>Furthermore the catalyst produced aromatic compounds such as <a href="benzene" class="uri" title="wikilink">benzene</a>, valuable for the <a href="chemical_industry" title="wikilink">chemical industry</a> and the developing <a href="plastics_industry" title="wikilink">plastics industry</a>. Thus Haensel had a major impact on three industries, and on the US economy. This was recognised in his receipt of the first National Academy of Sciences Award for Chemistry in Service to Society, 1981, &quot;For his outstanding research in the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons, that has greatly enhanced the economic value of our petroleum natural resources&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s the source of <a href="photochemical_smog" title="wikilink">photochemical smog</a> was established as automobile exhaust emissions. In his senior position in UOP, from 1956 to 1974, Haensel directed the research programs which led to <a href="catalytic_converter" title="wikilink">catalytic converters</a>.</p>
<p>He was the author, or co-author of 145 US patents.</p>
<p>In his later years (1981 - 1998), Haensel was an educator, encouraging undergraduates and postgraduates while remaining in touch with industry as a part-time consultant. His success was shown by receiving the Chancellor's Outstanding Teacher Award of the University of Massachusetts.</p>
