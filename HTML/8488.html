<p>The Climate of the <a href="Los_Angeles_Basin" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Basin</a> is most characterized by a <a href="Mediterranean_climate" title="wikilink">Mediterranean climate</a> or Dry-Summer <a href="Subtropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subtropical</a> (<a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen_climate_classification" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification</a> <em>Csb</em> on the coast, <em>Csa</em> inland), and most of the Basin receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen's <em>BSh</em> (warm <a href="semi-arid_climate" title="wikilink">semi-arid climate</a>) classification. The Los Angeles Basin receives plenty of sunshine, with 320 sunny days and only 40 rainy days on average every year.</p>
<p>Summers are warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of  and lows of , however temperatures sometimes exceed  during the summer. Winters are mild and somewhat rainy with high temperatures of  and lows of . Spring and autumn bring mild days with cool evenings and are generally dry.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a <a href="microclimate" class="uri" title="wikilink">microclimate</a>. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (10 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile from the coast inland.</p>
<p>Rainfall occurs mainly in the winter and spring months (February being the wettest month), with light rainfall, but sometimes as thunderstorms. Los Angeles averages  of precipitation per year, but is lower at the coast and higher at the mountains. Tornadoes are extraordinarily rare downtown, though <a href="waterspout" title="wikilink">waterspouts</a> can be seen during severe storms at beaches. <a href="Snow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Snow</a> is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was  on January 15, 1932.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="fall">Fall</h2>
<p>The <a href="Santa_Ana_winds" title="wikilink">Santa Ana winds</a> are strong, extremely dry offshore <a href="wind" title="wikilink">winds</a> that characteristically sweep through in <a href="Southern_California" title="wikilink">Southern California</a> and northern <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a> in late fall into winter. They can range from hot to cold, depending on the prevailing temperatures in the source regions, the <a href="Great_Basin" title="wikilink">Great Basin</a> and upper <a href="Mojave_Desert" title="wikilink">Mojave Desert</a>. However, the winds are remembered most for the hot dry weather (often the hottest of the year) that they bring in the fall.</p>
