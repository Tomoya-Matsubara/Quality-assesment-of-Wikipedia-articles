<p>The 139th <a href="The_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Boat Race</a> took place on 27 March 1993. Held annually, the Boat Race is a <a href="Rowing_(sport)#Side_by_side" title="wikilink">side-by-side rowing</a> race between crews from the Universities of <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> along the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>. Cambridge, using &quot;<a href="Oar_(sport_rowing)" title="wikilink">cleaver blades</a>&quot; for the first time in the history of the race, won by three-and-a-half lengths in a victory that was described in <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> as &quot;crushingly conclusive&quot;. The winning time of 17 minutes exactly was the fourth fastest time in the event. In winning the event, Cambridge prevented Oxford making it seventeen wins from the last eighteen races and levelling the overall score for the first time since the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1929" title="wikilink">1929 race</a>.</p>
<p>Oxford's crew featured two Olympic gold medallists and saw changes in their rowers and cox in the lead-up to the event. The race was umpired by the former Oxford <a href="Blue_(university_sport)" title="wikilink">Blue</a> <a href="Mark_Evans_(rower)" title="wikilink">Mark Evans</a> who controversially instigated changes to the start procedure of the race.</p>
<p>In the reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie_(Cambridge_University_Boat_Club)" title="wikilink">Goldie</a> defeated Oxford's Isis, while Cambridge won the <a href="Women&#39;s_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Women's Boat Race</a>.</p>

<p>The first <a href="Women&#39;s_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Women's Boat Race</a> took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. The race is conducted as part of the <a href="Henley_Boat_Races" title="wikilink">Henley Boat Races</a>, but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.

The surface area of the cleaver was approximately 20% larger than the conventional <a href="Oar_(sport_rowing)#Macon" title="wikilink">macon blades</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Oxford practised with cleaver blades in some of their outings leading up to the race, and were prepared to use them should the weather conditions be suitable, but on the day itself they opted to remain with the macon blades.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The umpire for the race was the Canadian Olympic gold medallist and former Oxford Blue <a href="Mark_Evans_(rower)" title="wikilink">Mark Evans</a> who had rowed in the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1983" title="wikilink">1983</a> and <a href="The_Boat_Race_1984" title="wikilink">1984 races</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He caused controversy by instigating a new starting method whereby he would hold the crews for up to ten seconds between the conventional &quot;set&quot; and &quot;go&quot; commands.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Evans had umpired the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1991" title="wikilink">1991 race</a> in which he had also used his own starting method in preference to the traditional <a href="Amateur_Rowing_Association" title="wikilink">Amateur Rowing Association</a> instructions.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In response to any potential delay at the start during which time the boats will be dragged along with the tide, one of the stake-boat men, Bob Hastings, responsible for holding the boats until the &quot;go&quot; command is given stated: &quot;If the boats start to drag I will let go, before I am dragged out of the stake-boat&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Both Alan Inns, former coach and advisor to Cambridge, and Steve Royle, Oxford's director of rowing, expressed concerns over Evans' methodology.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="crews">Crews</h2>
<p>The Oxford crew weighed an average of nearly  more per rower than their opponents. Oxford's <a href="Matthew_Pinsent" title="wikilink">Matthew Pinsent</a> was the heaviest rower while Cambridge's Sinclair Gore was the youngest, aged 19.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Cambridge's crew featured three returning <a href="Blue_(university_sport)" title="wikilink">Blues</a> in Dirk Bangert, David Gillard and James Behrens, while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Overall, half of the rowers were non-British (six nationalities representing Oxford, three representing Cambridge)<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and the same number were <a href="postgraduate" title="wikilink">postgraduates</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed: &quot;All our boat are at Cambridge on academic merit. They came for a particular course ... and they also row.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In contrast, an editorial in <em>The Times</em> claimed: &quot;The performers are no longer ingenuous native undergraduates but supercharged, international, professional rowing machines.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Oxford's <a href="Bruce_Robertson_(rower)" title="wikilink">Bruce Robertson</a> (men's eight) and Pinsent (coxless pair) were both gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>A late change in the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, becoming the eighth female cox in the history of the race.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was &quot;handling the pressure a lot better.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: &quot;We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole ... they're not aggressive or tough enough.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race. Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992)<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of &quot;professionals&quot; to the race. Of his selection, he noted: &quot;You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: &quot;I nearly didn't make it. I couldn't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Oxford's finishing coach was <a href="Mike_Spracklen" title="wikilink">Mike Spracklen</a> who had assisted the Dark Blues in five victorious races, while Cambridge had New Zealander <a href="Harry_Mahon" title="wikilink">Harry Mahon</a> in charge for the first time,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> assisted by John Wilson (who had helped coach Oxford to a win in the 1991 race),<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and Sean Bowden,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> who was subsequently credited with &quot;being half of the team which first turned Cambridge round&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Oxford's head coach <a href="Patrick_Sweeney_(rower)" title="wikilink">Patrick Sweeney</a> noted: &quot;If [Cambridge] get away, they will be hard to beat.
