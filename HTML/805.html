<p><strong>Swirl How</strong> is a <a href="fell" class="uri" title="wikilink">fell</a> in the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="Lake_District" title="wikilink">Lake District</a>. It stands between <a href="Coniston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coniston</a> and the <a href="Duddon_Valley" title="wikilink">Duddon Valley</a> in the southern part of the District.</p>
<p>The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins at <a href="Wrynose_Pass" title="wikilink">Wrynose Pass</a> and runs south for around 10 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a> before petering out at <a href="Broughton_in_Furness" title="wikilink">Broughton in Furness</a> on the Duddon Estuary. <a href="Alfred_Wainwright" title="wikilink">Alfred Wainwright</a> in his influential <em><a href="Pictorial_Guide_to_the_Lakeland_Fells" title="wikilink">Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells</a></em> took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work <em>The Outlying Fells of Lakeland</em>. Swirl How being the highest of the Coniston Fells therefore qualifies as one of the 214 <a href="Wainwrights" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wainwrights</a>. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>There is some doubt in the literature over the altitude of Swirl How. This takes on a greater significance since if it is the high point of the Coniston Fells, it is only so by a small margin. Its near neighbour, The <a href="Old_Man_of_Coniston" title="wikilink">Old Man of Coniston</a> is within a few feet of parity. The <a href="Ordnance_Survey" title="wikilink">Ordnance Survey</a> 1:25,000 series has no spot height for Swirl How, which would perhaps decide the issue. Birkett <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and Wainwright <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> quote 2,630 ft (802 m) whilst Richards <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the British Mountaineering Council 1:40,000 map <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> quote 2,637 ft (804 m)</p>
<p>Befitting the high point of the range, Swirl How sends out ridges to the four points of the compass, each leading to further fells. Consequently it also feeds the headwaters of four valleys.</p>
<p>The ridge northward to <a href="Great_Carrs" title="wikilink">Great Carrs</a> is named Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope climbing out of the Greenburn valley between neighbouring crags. The ridge is a grassy plateau with a pronounced downward tilt to the west. The eastern edge is precipitous, curving around the head of Greenburn. On the journey to Great Carrs the path passes a memorial. This is the site of a <a href="World_War_Two" title="wikilink">wartime</a> aircrash and bears the sad remains of a <a href="Royal_Canadian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> <a href="Handley_Page_Halifax" title="wikilink">Handley Page Halifax</a> bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial <a href="cairn" class="uri" title="wikilink">cairn</a> is on the top of the ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. It would appear that the plane approached from the west, failed to clear the ridge and tumbled down the other side. Other parts of the aircraft are preserved in the Ruskin Museum at nearby <a href="Brantwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brantwood</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The tilted plateau of the north ridge is triangular in plan, narrowing to a point at Fairfield in the west. This is the <a href="col" class="uri" title="wikilink">col</a> between Swirl How and the ridge's western outlier, <a href="Grey_Friar" title="wikilink">Grey Friar</a>. To the north of this ridge are long slopes leading down to the Duddon at Wrynose Bottom.</p>
<p>The main ridge continues southward, stepping down Great and Little How Crags to the depression of Levers Hawse. From here it rises again to <a href="Brim_Fell" title="wikilink">Brim Fell</a> with <a href="Dow_Crag" title="wikilink">Dow Crag</a> and The Old Man Of Coniston beyond. To the west of the Hawse is the valley of Tarn Head Beck, the main feeder of Seathwaite Tarn, a reservoir in a side valley of the Duddon system. This was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was dammed early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the <a href="Barrow_in_Furness" title="wikilink">Barrow in Furness</a> area. The dam is almost 400 yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth of the <a href="tarn_(lake)" title="wikilink">tarn</a> being around 80 ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> To the east of Levers Hawse is Levers Water. This smaller tarn has also been raised by damming, but in this case the original user was the Coniston Copper Mines. Following the decline of mining in the late 19th century a water treatment plant was eventually built and the tarn now supplies drinking water for Coniston village.</p>
<p>The eastern arm of Swirl How leads down the stony slope of Prison Band to the depression at Swirl Hawse. From here it rises over the subsidiary top of Black Sails to the main summit of <a href="Wetherlam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wetherlam</a>. Swirl Hawse Beck runs south from this ridge to feed Levers Water, whilst to the north of Wetherlam is Greenburn.</p>
<p>The summit of Swirl How is marked by a fine cairn on a stony top, built close to the Greenburn edge of the ridge. The view to the north takes in massed ranks of fells while in other directions the Isle of Man, Morecambe Bay and Pennines can be seen. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Direct ascents can be made via Levers Hawse to the south or Swirl Hawse to the east. Both can be gained from Coniston and Swirl Hawse is also a practicable objective from Little Langdale. The right of way shown up the western (Duddon) side of Levers Hawse does not exist as a path on the ground. Many walkers will arrive on Swirl How via one of the surrounding fells, all four ridges carrying fair paths.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
