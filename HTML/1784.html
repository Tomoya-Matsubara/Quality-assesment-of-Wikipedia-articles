<p>Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it &quot;gave all the main characters an opportunity to shine&quot; and that the episode &quot;delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level.&quot; He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional <a href="sitcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitcom</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>'s Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, &quot;<a href="Jackie_Jormp-Jomp" title="wikilink">Jackie Jormp-Jomp</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Writing for <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">The Star-Ledger</a></em> Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a <em>30 Rock</em> classic it &quot;had more than enough funny things in it to keep me satisfied.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V.

Nonetheless, Rabin gave &quot;The Ones&quot; a B-.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> David Bauder of the <em><a href="Guelph_Mercury" title="wikilink">Guelph Mercury</a></em>, however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are &quot;the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role with gusto, matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Jenna's storyline in the episode received mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> while Sepinwall reported it did not work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with <a href="Scott_Adsit" title="wikilink">Scott Adsit</a>'s <em>30 Rock</em> character, <a href="Pete_Hornberger" title="wikilink">Pete Hornberger</a>, as in this episode, &quot;as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> As with Sepinwall, <a href="Bob_Sassone" title="wikilink">Bob Sassone</a> of <a href="AOL" class="uri" title="wikilink">AOL</a>'s <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but &quot;it just went on too long and got tedious and silly.&quot; He believed it would be a good idea to have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined &quot;The Ones&quot; did not choose that path.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Tom_O&#39;Neil" title="wikilink">Tom O'Neil</a> from the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on <em>30 Rock</em>, but felt that &quot;The Ones&quot; would not be the episode she win the Outstanding Best Actress award.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
