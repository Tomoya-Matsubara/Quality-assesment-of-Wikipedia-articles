The couple met on October 5, 1997 at a picnic. They were married on June 12, 1999.</p>
<p>The Gosselin's desire to start a family was met with infertility. Kate underwent medical testing and was diagnosed with <a href="polycystic_ovary_syndrome" title="wikilink">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>. The couple turned to fertility treatments and immediately began <a href="intrauterine_insemination" title="wikilink">intrauterine insemination</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By February 2000, Kate was pregnant with twins.

<p>On the couple's appearance on <em><a href="The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show" title="wikilink">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></em>, which aired on February 22, 2008, Kate admitted that she wanted to have another child, while Jon was hesitant because he felt like the world is built for a family of four. According to Kate, a biracial infant of a teenage girl became available to adopt while Kate was an <a href="obstetrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">obstetrics</a> nurse. They decided not to adopt the baby, but instead returned to fertility treatment.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By October, Kate was again pregnant. Five weeks later (after being hospitalized for over-stimulated ovaries), at the initial ultrasound, the doctor announced that there were six sacs with seven yolks (<a href="Human_embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a>).

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>DiscoveryHealth starting filming the show in the form of two hour-long specials, then TLC continued filming for a weekly series when the sextuplets were a year old.</p>
<p>Between the specials and the series, permanent light fixtures were installed in the Gosselins' home to facilitate filming and prevent the children from tripping over the wires and cables of temporary lighting. <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> is filmed three days a week with one day set aside for the interview sessions where Jon, Kate, and occasionally the children, discuss the events which take place in each episode. Jon and Kate also work closely with producers to decide what themes will be presented in each episode. Jon and Kate have remarked that over the years the production crew has become part of the family since they have estranged themselves from their own family.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
