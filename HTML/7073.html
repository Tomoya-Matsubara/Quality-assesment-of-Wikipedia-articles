<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Amaker was born in , in 1965. He was raised by a single mother, Alma Amaker, a high school English teacher. Although not a part of Amaker's young life, his father was attending some of Amaker's basketball games by the time he was in high school.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Amaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended <a href="Wilbert_Tucker_Woodson_High_School" title="wikilink">W.T. Woodson High School</a> in <a href="Fairfax,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Fairfax</a>, Virginia, because his mother was a teacher in <a href="Fairfax_County_Public_Schools" title="wikilink">Fairfax County</a>. Her job allowed her to choose among the county schools, her choice made because the school's basketball coach, Red Jenkins, who called Amaker &quot;T-bird&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> had been impressed with his performances at his youth summer league since Amaker was 10 years old.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He began playing varsity for Woodson by December,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> making him the first freshman to play varsity in the school's history.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His mother, whom Jenkins called &quot;his first coach and his best coach&quot;, attended his practices and graded papers in the coach's office.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
