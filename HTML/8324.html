<p>The <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_Forever" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem Forever</a></em> spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011.

It is a sequel to the 1996 game <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_3D" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>, as part of the long-running <em><a href="Duke_Nukem" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem</a></em> video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered <a href="vaporware" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaporware</a> due to its severely protracted <a href="development_hell" title="wikilink">development schedule</a>; the game had been in development under <a href="3D_Realms" title="wikilink">3D Realms</a> since 1996. Director <a href="George_Broussard" title="wikilink">George Broussard</a>, one of the creators of the original <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_(1991_video_game)" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem</a></em> game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and promotional information for the game was released in one form or another from 1997 until its release in 2011.</p>
<p>After repeatedly announcing and deferring release dates, 3D Realms announced in 2001 that it would be released simply &quot;when it's done&quot;. In May 2009, 3D Realms was downsized for financial reasons, resulting in the loss of the game's development team. Statements by the company indicated that the project was due to &quot;go <a href="Release_to_manufacture" title="wikilink">gold</a>&quot; soon with pictures of final development. <a href="Take-Two_Interactive" title="wikilink">Take-Two Interactive</a>, which owns the publishing rights to the game, filed a lawsuit in 2009 against 3D Realms over their &quot;failure to finish development&quot;. 3D Realms retorted that Take-Two's legal interest in the game is limited to their publishing right. The case was settled with <a href="prejudice_(legal_procedure)" title="wikilink">prejudice</a> and details undisclosed in May 2010. On September 3, 2010, 14 years after the start of the development, <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> was officially reported by <a href="2K_Games" title="wikilink">2K Games</a> to be in development at <a href="Gearbox_Software" title="wikilink">Gearbox Software</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> with an expected release date of 2011.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The official release date was then revealed to be May 3, 2011 in North America, with a worldwide release following on May 6, 2011.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This was however delayed by a month to June 10 internationally with a North American release on June 14.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> was finally released after 15 years of development on June 10, 2011.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="Scott_Miller_(entrepreneur)" title="wikilink">Scott Miller</a> was a lifelong gamer who released his text-based video games as <a href="shareware" class="uri" title="wikilink">shareware</a> in the 1980s. By 1988, the shareware business was a $10 to $20 million a year market, but the distribution method had never been tried for video games. Miller found that gamers were not willing to pay for something they could get for free, so he came up with the idea of offering only the opening levels of his games; players could purchase the game to receive the rest of the game.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="George_Broussard" title="wikilink">George Broussard</a>, whom Miller met while he was in high school, joined Miller at his company, <a href="3D_Realms" title="wikilink">Apogee</a>, which published and marketed games developed by other companies. While Miller was quiet, with a head for business, Broussard was an enthusiastic &quot;creative impresario&quot;. Apogee (from which a new brand name was made in 1994, 3D Realms) grew from a small startup to a successful corporation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Among the titles they published was <a href="id_Software" title="wikilink">id Software</a>'s <em><a href="Commander_Keen" title="wikilink">Commander Keen</a></em> in 1990 and <em><a href="Wolfenstein_3D" title="wikilink">Wolfenstein 3D</a></em> in 1992. Commander Keen met great success, leading to the development of many sidescrollers for the <a href="MS-DOS" title="wikilink">DOS</a> platform, including many developed by Apogee and using the same engine that powered the <em>Keen</em> games, and Wolfenstein was highly successful, popularizing 3D gaming and establishing the <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> (FPS) genre.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1994, Broussard began working on 3D Realms' own first-person shooter. Rather than the faceless marine of other games, players assumed the role of <a href="Duke_Nukem_(character)" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem</a>, a character who Broussard described as &quot;a combo of <a href="John_Wayne" title="wikilink">John Wayne</a>, <a href="Clint_Eastwood" title="wikilink">Clint Eastwood</a>, and <a href="Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="wikilink">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>&quot;, and who had previously starred in two 2D platformers, <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_(1991_video_game)" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem</a></em> and <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_II" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem II</a></em>, developed by Apogee. After a year and a half of work, <em><a href="Duke_Nukem_3D" title="wikilink">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em> was released in January 1996.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Among game aspects that appealed to players were environmental interaction and adult-oriented content&lt;U+2014&gt;including blood and strippers.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Buoyed by the success, Broussard announced a follow-up, <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> was officially announced on April 28, 1997,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> with the intention of releasing the game no later than mid-1998.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Barely a year after the release of <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, the game's graphics and its game engine, the <a href="Build_engine" title="wikilink">Build engine</a>, were antiquated.

<p>In August and September, the first screenshots of <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> were released in <em><a href="PC_Gamer" title="wikilink">PC Gamer</a></em>. However, 3D Realms did not receive the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> using the Quake II engine at the 1998 <a href="Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) conference.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The trailer showed Duke fighting on the back of a moving truck and firefights with aliens.

The Unreal Engine was more realistic than Quake II and was better suited to producing open spaces&lt;U+2014&gt;3D Realms had been struggling to render the Nevada desert. Soon after E3, a programmer suggested that they make the switch. After discussions, the developers unanimously agreed to the change, which would mean scrapping much of their work so far,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> including significant changes 3D Realms had made to the Quake Engine.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In June 1998, 14 months after the Quake II announcement, 3D Realms made the switch announcement. Broussard said that the game would not be &quot;significantly delayed&quot; by the switch, but that the project would be back to where it was at E3 &quot;within a month to six weeks&quot;. Broussard also said that no content seen in the E3 trailer would be lost.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Chris Hargrove, one of the game's programmers at the time, confided that the change amounted to a complete reboot of the project.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of 1999, <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> had missed several release dates and was largely unfinished; half the game's weapons remained concepts.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Broussard shot back at criticisms of the game's lengthy development time as the price paid for developing complex modern games: A significant factor contributing to the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as he would want to include portions of it in <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to a new version of the Unreal engine that was designed for <a href="multiplayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">multiplayer</a> matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired <a href="Bear_Stearns" title="wikilink">Bear Stearns</a> to look into selling the company or merging it.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Later that year, <a href="Infogrames_Entertainment,_SA" title="wikilink">Infogrames Entertainment</a> announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The publishing rights for <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> passed to <a href="Gathering_of_Developers" title="wikilink">Gathering of Developers</a> in early December 2000.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>To placate anxious fans, Broussard decided to create another trailer for E3 2001&lt;U+2014&gt;it was the first public look at the game in three years.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The video showed a couple of minutes of in-game footage,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of interactivity (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a <a href="keypad" class="uri" title="wikilink">keypad</a> with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and <em>Duke Nukem</em> was the talk of the convention;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, &quot;Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more.

<p>By 2003, only 18 people at 3D Realms were working on the game. One former employee said that Broussard and Miller were still operating on a &quot;1995 mentality&quot;, before games became large-team, big budget development affairs. Because they were financing the project themselves, the developers could also ignore pressure from their publisher;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> their standard reply to when <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> would ship was &quot;when it's done&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He further said the company was writing off $5.5 million from its earnings due to <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>{{'}}s lengthy development time.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Broussard shot back that &quot;Take-Two needs to <a href="wikt:STFU" title="wikilink">STFU</a> ...

Closed-doors demonstrations of the technology suggested that the physics of <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> would be a step up from the critically acclaimed <em><a href="Half-Life_2" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2</a></em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Rumors suggested that the game would appear at 2005 <a href="E3_(Electronic_Entertainment_Expo)" title="wikilink">E3</a>.

<p>Broussard reported in a January 2006 interview that many of <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>{{'}}s elements had been finished; &quot;we're just basically pulling it all together and trying to make it fun&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Later that year Broussard demonstrated samples of the game, including an early level, a vehicle sequence, and a few test rooms.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Among the features seen was the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The developer seemed contrite and affected by the long delays; while a journalist demoed the game Broussard referenced note cards and constantly apologized for the state of the game.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In filing with the <a href="United_States_Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="wikilink">United States Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, Take-Two revealed they had renegotiated the <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> deal, with the developer receiving $4.25 million instead of $6 million on release of the game.

<p>Some of the staff were tired of the delays&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> was the only 3D game many had worked on, giving them little to put on a resume, and as much of 3D Realms' payment hinged on profit-sharing after release, the continual delays meant deferred income.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> By August 2006, between 7&lt;U+2013&gt;10 employees had left since 2005, a majority of the <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> team (which in recent months had shrunk to around 18 staff).<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> While <a href="Shacknews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shacknews</a> speculated that the departures would lead to further delays, 3D Realms denied the claims, stating that the employees had left over a number of months and that the game was still moving ahead.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Creative director Raphael van Lierop, hired in 2007, played through the completed content and realized that there was more finished than he expected.

<p>Despite the discontinuation of internal game development at 3D Realms, development of the game did not cease entirely. Nine ex-employees including key personnel like Allen Blum, continued game development throughout 2009 from their homes. These employees would later become Triptych Games, an independent studio<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> housed in the same building as Gearbox, whom they collaborated with on the project.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
