<p>Robert Were Fox the Younger was born on 26 April 1789 at <a href="Falmouth,_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Falmouth</a>, <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, the eldest son of <a href="Robert_Were_Fox_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Robert Were Fox</a> (1754 – 1818)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his wife, Elizabeth Tregelles.

<p>In 1814, Fox the Younger married Maria Barclay (1785 – 1858), daughter of Robert and Rachel Barclay of Bury Hill, near Dorking, Surrey. Maria's sister, Lucy, married Fox's cousin, George Croker Fox (1784&lt;U+2013&gt;1850).</p>

<p>Fox's gardens at Rosehill<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and <a href="Penjerrick_Garden" title="wikilink">Penjerrick</a>, near Falmouth, became noted for the number of exotic plants which he and his son, Barclay, had naturalized.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-work">Scientific work</h2>
<p><img src="Fox_Robert_Were_apparatus.jpg" title="fig:Experimental apparatus of Fox" alt="Experimental apparatus of Fox" /> Fox's work was in what today would be referred to as <a href="geophysics" class="uri" title="wikilink">geophysics</a>. He was distinguished for his researches on the internal temperature of the earth, contributing papers to the <a href="Royal_Geological_Society_of_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Royal Geological Society of Cornwall</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and being the first to prove that temperature definitely increases with depth (the <a href="geothermal_gradient" title="wikilink">geothermal gradient</a>), his observations being conducted in Cornish mines from 1815 for a period of forty years.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1829 he began a set of experiments on the artificial production of miniature <a href="wikt:metalliferous" title="wikilink">metalliferous</a> veins by means of the long-continued influence of electric currents, and his main results were published in 1836.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1834 Fox constructed an improved form of deflector dipping needle compass, or <a href="dip_circle" title="wikilink">dip circle</a>, for polar navigation.<ref><strong>Dipping Needle</strong> In <em>A New and Universal Dictionary of the Marine</em> by William Falconer, improved and modernised by William Burney; T. Cadell &amp; William Davey and John Murray, 1830: Pages 122, 123 and Plate IX, Figure 11, the dip of a needle is defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a certain property which all needles possess when rubbed with a lodestone of inclining the north end below the level of the horizon: this property found to increase in going northward.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p></ref> One was used by Sir <a href="James_Clark_Ross" title="wikilink">James Clark Ross</a> on his Antarctic expedition and used to discover the position of the <a href="South_magnetic_pole" title="wikilink">South magnetic pole</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>He was a key person in the development of the <a href="Royal_Cornwall_Polytechnic_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society</a> and its promotion of scientific research and training. He was an active member of the <a href="British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="wikilink">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.</p>
<p>Robert Were Fox, his cousin, George Croker Fox (1784&lt;U+2013&gt;1850) and brother, Alfred Fox, assembled excellent collections of minerals, which are now in the <a href="British_Museum_(Natural_History)" title="wikilink">British Museum (Natural History)</a>, given by <a href="Sir_Arthur_Edward_Ian_Montagu_Russell,_6th_Baronet" title="wikilink">Arthur Russell</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
