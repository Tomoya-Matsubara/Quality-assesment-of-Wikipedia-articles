<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In 1946, Transjordan gained independence from the <a href="British_Mandate_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">British Mandate for Palestine</a>. A year later, the UN adopted a <a href="United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">partition plan</a> for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by the Arab leaders and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the <a href="Jewish_Agency_for_Israel" title="wikilink">Jewish Agency for Israel</a> declared the establishment of the &quot;<a href="State_of_Israel" title="wikilink">State of Israel</a>&quot; according to the proposed UN plan. The Arab Higher Committee didn't declare a state of its own and instead, together with Transjordan, Egypt, and the other members of the Arab League of the time, started the 1948 Arab&lt;U+2013&gt;Israeli War. During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were expected to form part of the Arab state under the UN plan. Egypt <a href="Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_Egypt" title="wikilink">gained control</a> over the Gaza Strip and Transjordan <a href="Occupation_of_the_West_Bank_and_East_Jerusalem_by_Jordan" title="wikilink">gained control</a> over the West Bank. Egypt initially supported the creation of an <a href="All-Palestine_Government" title="wikilink">All-Palestine Government</a>, but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognised it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form <a href="Jordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordan</a>. The annexation was ratified in 1950. The <a href="Six-Day_War" title="wikilink">Six-Day War</a> in 1967, when Egypt, Jordan and <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> fought against Israel, ended with significant territorial expansion by Israel, including the whole of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which remain under Israeli occupation.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The <a href="Palestinian_National_Charter" title="wikilink">Palestinian National Charter</a> of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but later relocated to <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> after <a href="Black_September_in_Jordan" title="wikilink">Black September</a> in 1971. In 1974, the Arab League recognised the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and it gained observer status at the UN General Assembly. After the <a href="1982_Lebanon_War" title="wikilink">1982 Lebanon War</a>, the PLO moved to <a href="Tunisia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a>.</p>
<p>In 1979, through the <a href="Camp_David_Accords" title="wikilink">Camp David Accords</a> Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan ceded its claims to the West Bank &lt;U+2014&gt; with the exception of guardianship over <a href="Haram_al-Sharif" title="wikilink">Haram al-Sharif</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; to the PLO. In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the &quot;State of Palestine&quot;. In the month following, it was quickly recognised by many states, including Egypt and Jordan. In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the &quot;Palestinian territory&quot;, without specififying further. Because of this, some of the countries that recognised the State of Palestine in their statements of recognition refer to the &quot;1967 borders&quot;, thus recognising as its territory only the occupied Palestinian territory, and not Israel. During the negotiations of the Oslo Accords, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist, and Israel recognised the PLO as representative of the Palestinian people. Between 1993 and 1998, the PLO made commitments to change the provisions of its Palestinian National Charter that are inconsistent with the aim for a two-state solution and peaceful coexistence with Israel.</p>
<p>After Israel took control of the Palestinian territories from Jordan and Egypt, it began to establish <a href="Israeli_settlement" title="wikilink">Israeli settlements</a> there.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> These were organised into <a href="Judea_and_Samaria_Area" title="wikilink">Judea and Samaria district</a> (West Bank) and <a href="Hof_Aza_Regional_Council" title="wikilink">Hof Aza Regional Council</a> (Gaza Strip) in the <a href="Southern_District_(Israel)" title="wikilink">Southern District</a>. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the <a href="Israeli_Civil_Administration" title="wikilink">Israeli Civil Administration</a> of the <a href="Coordinator_of_Government_Activities_in_the_Territories" title="wikilink">Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories</a> and by local <a href="Municipality_(Palestinian_Authority)" title="wikilink">municipal councils</a> present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA. It was given civilian and/or security control in some areas. In 2005, following the implementation of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, the PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and <a href="territorial_waters" title="wikilink">territorial waters</a>. Following the <a href="Fatah&lt;U+2013&gt;Hamas_conflict" title="wikilink">inter-Palestinian conflict</a> in 2006, <a href="Hamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamas</a> took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and <a href="Fatah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fatah</a> took control of the West Bank (and the rest of the PNA institutions). Currently the Gaza Strip is <a href="Governance_of_the_Gaza_Strip" title="wikilink">governed by</a> Hamas, and the West Bank by Fatah.</p>
<h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
<p>Since the British Mandate, the term &quot;<a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>&quot; has been associated with the geographical area that currently covers the State of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> though the British Mandate also covered present day <a href="Jordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordan</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the early years of the First World War, negotiations took place between the British <a href="High_Commissioner" title="wikilink">High Commissioner</a> in Egypt, <a href="Henry_McMahon" title="wikilink">Henry McMahon</a> and the <a href="Sharif_of_Mecca" title="wikilink">Sharif of Mecca</a>, <a href="Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca" title="wikilink">Husayn bin Ali</a> for an alliance of sorts with the Arabs against the Ottomans in Arab Near East. On 24 October 1915, McMahon sent to Hussein a note which the Arabs treated as their &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;. In <a href="McMahon_letters" title="wikilink">McMahon's letter</a>, part of the <a href="McMahon&lt;U+2013&gt;Hussein_Correspondence" title="wikilink">McMahon&lt;U+2013&gt;Hussein Correspondence</a>, McMahon declared Britain's willingness to recognise the independence of the Arabs, both in the Levant and the Hejaz, subject to certain exemptions. It stated on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The districts of Mersin and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, cannot be said to be purely Arab, and must on that account be excepted from the proposed <a href="boundary_delimitation" title="wikilink">delimitation</a>.</em> <em>Subject to that modification, and without prejudice to the treaties concluded between us and certain Arab Chiefs, we accept that delimitation.</em> <em>As for the regions lying within the proposed frontiers, in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to interests of her ally France, I am authorized to give you the following pledges on behalf of the Government of Great Britain, and to reply as follows to your note:</em> <em>That subject to the modifications stated above, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and uphold the independence of the Arabs in all the regions lying within the frontiers proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.</em><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exemptions from Arab control of certain areas set out in the McMahon note were to seriously complicate the problems of peace in the Near East. At the time, the Arab portions of the Ottoman Empire were divided into administrative units called <em>vilayets</em> and <em>sanjaks</em>. Palestine was divided into the <em>sanjuks</em> of Acre and Nablus, both of which were a part of the <a href="vilayet_of_Beirut" title="wikilink">vilayet of Beirut</a>, and an independent <em>sanjak</em> of Jerusalem. The areas exempted from Arab control by the McMahon note included &quot;Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.&quot; The British understanding was that &quot;Damascus&quot; meant the <em>vilayet</em> and not the city of Damascus, and accordingly virtually all of Palestine was excluded from Arab control. The British entered into the secret <a href="Sykes&lt;U+2013&gt;Picot_Agreement" title="wikilink">Sykes&lt;U+2013&gt;Picot Agreement</a> on 16 May 1916 and the commitment of the <a href="Balfour_Declaration_of_1917" title="wikilink">Balfour Declaration of 1917</a>, for example, on that understanding.</p>
<p>The Arabs, however, insisted at the <a href="Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Conference</a> at the end of the War that &quot;Damascus&quot; meant the city of Damascus &lt;U+2013&gt; which left Palestine in their hands.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, in 1915, these problems of interpretation did not occur to Hussein, who agreed to the British wording. The Arab interpretation of the agreement formed the basis of Arab claims to Palestine at the Peace Conference.</p>

<p>Despite Arab objections based in part on the Arab interpretation of the McMahon correspondence noted above, Britain was given the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> <a href="Mandate_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">Mandate for Palestine</a>. The Mandate was administered as two territories: <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> and <a href="Transjordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transjordan</a>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> with the Jordan River being the boundary between them. The boundaries under the Mandate also did not follow those sought by the Jewish community, which sought the inclusion of the east bank of the Jordan into the Palestinian territory, to which the objective of the Mandate for a <a href="homeland_for_the_Jewish_people" title="wikilink">homeland for the Jewish people</a> would apply. It was made clear from before the commencement of the Mandate, and a clause to that effect was inserted in the Mandate, that the objective set out in the Mandate would not apply to Transjordan. Transjordan was destined for early independence. The objective of the Mandate was to apply only to territory west of the Jordan, which was commonly referred to as Palestine by the British administration, and as <a href="Eretz_Israel" title="wikilink">Eretz Israel</a> by the Jewish community.</p>
<h4 id="the-arab-league-and-the-arab-higher-committee-1945">The Arab League and the Arab Higher Committee (1945)</h4>
<p>The framers of the Arab League sought to include the Palestinian Arabs within the framework of the League from its inception.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> An annex to the League Pact declared:<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned <em>de jure</em> than the independence of any of the other Arab States. [...] Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In November 1945, the <a href="Arab_League" title="wikilink">Arab League</a> reconstituted the <a href="Arab_Higher_Committee" title="wikilink">Arab Higher Committee</a> comprising twelve members<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> as the supreme executive body of Palestinian Arabs in the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine. The committee was dominated by the <a href="Palestine_Arab_Party" title="wikilink">Palestine Arab Party</a> and was immediately recognised by Arab League countries. The Mandate government recognised the new Committee two months later. The Constitution of the League of Arab States says the existence and independence of Palestine cannot be questioned <em>de jure</em> even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of force majeure.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1946, Jewish leaders - including Nahum Goldmann, Rabbi Abba Silver, Moshe Shertok, and David Ben Gurion - proposed a union between Arab Palestine and Transjordan.<ref>For example:</p>

</ul>
<p>The <a href="United_Nations_Special_Committee_on_Palestine" title="wikilink">United Nations Special Committee on Palestine</a> (UNSCOP), which was formed to recommend a solution to Britain's dilemma in Palestine, subsequently reported that the proposed Arab state would not be economically viable. The report indicated that the Arab state would be forced to call for financial assistance &quot;from international institutions in the way of loans for expansion of education, public health and other vital social services of a non-self-supporting nature.&quot; A technical note from the Secretariat explained that without some redistribution of customs from the Jewish state, Arab Palestine would not be economically viable. The Committee was satisfied that the proposed Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem would be viable.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1947, the United Nations proposed the partition of Mandate Palestine into an Arab state, a <a href="Jewish_state" title="wikilink">Jewish state</a>, and a <a href="Corpus_Separatum" title="wikilink">Corpus Separatum</a> for Jerusalem. The <a href="United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine</a> was a resolution adopted on 29 November 1947 by the <a href="UN_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">General Assembly</a> of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>. Its title was United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) Future Government of Palestine. The resolution noted Britain's planned termination of the <a href="British_Mandate_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">British Mandate for Palestine</a> and recommended the partition of <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> into two states, one <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> and one <a href="Arab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arab</a>, with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area being under special international protection, administered by the United Nations. The resolution included a highly detailed description of the recommended boundaries for each proposed state.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The resolution also contained a plan for an economic union between the proposed states, and a plan for the protection of religious and minority rights. The resolution sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims to the Mandate territory of two competing nationalist movements, <a href="Zionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zionism</a> (Jewish nationalism) and Arab nationalism, as well as to resolve the plight of Jews displaced as a result of the <a href="Holocaust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a>. The resolution called for the withdrawal of British forces and termination of the Mandate by 1 August 1948, and establishment of the new independent states by 1 October 1948.</p>
<p>The Partition Plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by the Arab leaders. The Arab League threatened to take military measures to prevent the partition of Palestine and to ensure the national rights of the Palestinian Arab population. One day before the expiration of the British Mandate for Palestine, on 14 May 1948, Israel declared its independence within the borders of the Jewish State set out in the Partition Plan. <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> U.S. President Harry Truman recognised the State of Israel <em>de facto</em> the following day.

On April 12, 1948, the Arab League announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Arab armies shall enter Palestine to rescue it. His Majesty (King Farouk, representing the League) would like to make it clearly understood that such measures should be looked upon as temporary and devoid of any character of the occupation or partition of Palestine, and that after completion of its liberation, that country would be handed over to its owners to rule in the way they like.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jordan occupied the area of <a href="Cisjordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cisjordan</a>, now called the <a href="West_Bank" title="wikilink">West Bank</a>, which it continued to control in accordance with the <a href="1949_Armistice_Agreements" title="wikilink">1949 Armistice Agreements</a> and a political union formed in December 1948. Military Proclamation Number 2 of 1948 provided for the application in the West Bank of laws that were applicable in Palestine on the eve of the termination of the Mandate. On 2 November 1948, the military rule was replaced by a civilian administration by virtue of the Law Amending Public Administration Law in Palestine. Military Proclamation Number 17 of 1949, Section 2, vested the King of Jordan with all the powers that were enjoyed by the King of England, his ministers and the High Commissioner of Palestine by the Palestine Order-in-Council, 1922.

The Arab League &quot;supervised&quot; the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was &quot;without prejudice to the final settlement&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

Plascov said that the Palestinian Congresses were conducted in accordance with prevailing Arab custom.

<p>The Transjordanian Government agreed to the unification on December 7, 1948, and on December 13 the Transjordanian parliament approved the creation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The change of status was reflected by the adoption of this new official name on 21 January 1949.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Unification was ratified by a joint Jordanian National Assembly on 24 April 1950 which comprised 20 representatives each from the East and West Bank. The Act of Union contained a protective clause which preserved Arab rights in Palestine &quot;without prejudice to any final settlement&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Many legal scholars say the declaration of the Arab League and the Act of Union implied that Jordan's claim of sovereignty was provisional, because it had always been subject to the emergence of the Palestinian state.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A political union was legally established by the series of proclamations, decrees, and parliamentary acts in December 1948. Abdullah thereupon took the title King of Jordan, and he officially changed the country's name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in April 1949. The 1950 Act of Union confirmed and ratified King Abdullah's actions. Following the annexation of the West Bank, only two countries formally recognized the union: Britain and Pakistan.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Thomas Kuttner notes that de facto recognition was granted to the regime, most clearly evidenced by the maintaining of consulates in East Jerusalem by several countries, including the United States.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Joseph Weiler agreed, and said that other states had engaged in activities, statements, and resolutions that would be inconsistent with non-recognition.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Joseph Massad said that the members of the Arab League granted <em>de facto</em> recognition and that the United States had formally recognized the annexation, except for Jerusalem.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The United States extended <em>de jure</em> recognition to the Government of Transjordan and the Government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> U.S. President Truman told King Abdullah that the policy of the United States Government as regards a final territorial settlement in Palestine had been stated in the General Assembly on 30 November 1948 by the American representative. The U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution of 29 November 1947, but believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine allotted to the Arabs, it should give the Arabs territorial compensation.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Clea Bunch said that &quot;President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President's mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. In addition, Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with de jure recognition.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Sandra Berliant Kadosh analyzed United States policy toward the West Bank in 1948, based largely on the Foreign Relations Documents of the United States. She noted that the U.S. government believed that the most satisfactory solution regarding the disposition of the greater part of Arab Palestine would be incorporation in Transjordan and that the State Department approved the Principle underlying the Jericho resolutions.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Kadosh said that the delegates claimed to represent 90 percent of the population, and that they ridiculed the Gaza government.

The <a href="All-Palestine_Government" title="wikilink">All-Palestine Government</a> issued a Declaration of the Independent State of Palestine on October 1, 1948.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In 1957, the Basic Law of Gaza established a Legislative Council that could pass laws which were given to the High Administrator-General for approval.

<p>The U.S. advised the Arab states that the U.S. attitude regarding Israel had been clearly stated in the UN by Dr. Jessup on November 20, 1949. He said that the U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution. However, the U.S. believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine it should give the Arabs other territory as compensation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The Israelis agreed that the boundaries were negotiable, but did not agree to the principle of compensation as a precondition. Israel's Foreign Minister <a href="Abba_Eban" title="wikilink">Eban</a> stressed that it was undesirable to undermine what had already been accomplished by the armistice agreements, and maintained that Israel held no territory wrongfully, since her occupation of the areas had been sanctioned by the armistice agreements, as had the occupation of the territory in Palestine held by the Arab states.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1950, the UN Economic Survey Mission for the Middle East, headed by Gordon R. Clapp, recommended four development projects, involving the <a href="Zarqa_River" title="wikilink">Wadi Zerqa</a> basin in Jordan, the <a href="Wadi_Qelt" title="wikilink">Wadi Qelt</a> watershed and stream bed in Arab Palestine, the <a href="Litani_River" title="wikilink">Litani River</a> in Lebanon, and the <a href="Ghab_valley" title="wikilink">Ghab valley</a> in Syria.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> U.S. President <a href="Harry_S._Truman" title="wikilink">Harry Truman</a> subsequently announced that the Foreign Economic Assistance Act of 1950 contained an appropriation of US$27 million dollars for the development projects recommended by the Clapp Mission and to assist Palestinian refugees.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1978 the U.S. State Department published a memorandum of conversation held on June 5, 1950 between Mr. Stuart W. Rockwell of the Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation: Mr. Rifai asked when the United States was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Mr. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the United States to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the U.S. accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Mr. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the U.S. did in fact recognize the union.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-six-day-war-1967">The Six Day War (1967)</h3>
<p>Between 5 June 1967, Israel went to war, effectively seizing control of the <a href="Gaza_Strip" title="wikilink">Gaza Strip</a> and the <a href="Sinai_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Sinai Peninsula</a> from Egypt, the <a href="West_Bank" title="wikilink">West Bank</a> and <a href="East_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">East Jerusalem</a> from Jordan, and the <a href="Golan_Heights" title="wikilink">Golan Heights</a> from Syria.</p>
<p>On 9 June 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured the U.S. that it was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no &quot;colonial&quot; aspirations.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> U.S. Secretary of State <a href="Dean_Rusk" title="wikilink">Dean Rusk</a> stressed to Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the global community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The U.S. also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>On 3 November 1967, U.S. Ambassador <a href="Arthur_Goldberg" title="wikilink">Goldberg</a> called on King Hussein of Jordan, saying that the U.S. was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. According to Goldberg, the U.S. believed in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles, there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The U.S. President's Special Assistant, <a href="Walt_Rostow" title="wikilink">Walt Rostow</a>, told Israeli ambassador <a href="Avraham_Harman" title="wikilink">Harmon</a> that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the U.S. expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarisation arrangements rather than toward major changes in the armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration, but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including &quot;sovereignty&quot;. Rostow said the U.S. government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1967 war also laid the foundation for future discord in the region - as on November 22, 1967, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 242, the &quot;land for peace&quot; formula, which called for Israeli withdrawal &quot;from territories occupied&quot; in 1967 and &quot;the termination of all claims or states of belligerency.&quot;  Resolution 242 recognized the right of &quot;every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.&quot; </p>
<h3 id="rift-between-jordan-and-palestinian-leadership-1970">Rift between Jordan and Palestinian Leadership (1970)</h3>
<p>After the events of <a href="Black_September_in_Jordan" title="wikilink">Black September in Jordan</a>, the rift between the Palestinian leadership and the Kingdom of Jordan continued to widen. The Arab League affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to <em>self-determination</em> and called on all the Arab states, including Jordan, to undertake to defend Palestinian national unity and not to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs. The Arab League also 'affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated.' King &lt;U+1E24&gt;ussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament. Half of its members had been West Bank representatives. He renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank, and allowed the PLO to assume responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine. The Kingdom of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria no longer act as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people, or their territory.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rise-of-the-palestinian-liberation-organization-1974">Rise of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (1974)</h3>
<p>At the <a href="Rabat_summit_conference" title="wikilink">Rabat summit conference</a> in 1974, Jordan and the other members of the <a href="Arab_League" title="wikilink">Arab League</a> declared that the <a href="Palestinian_Liberation_Organization" title="wikilink">Palestinian Liberation Organization</a> was the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the [Arab] Palestinian people&quot;, thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.</p>
<p>In a speech delivered on 1 September 1982, U.S. President <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> called for a settlement freeze and continued to support full Palestinian autonomy in political union with Jordan. He also said that &quot;It is the United States' position that &lt;U+2013&gt; in return for peace &lt;U+2013&gt; the withdrawal provision of Resolution 242 applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>The Amman Agreement of February 11, 1985, declared that the PLO and Jordan would pursue a proposed confederation between the state of Jordan and a Palestinian state.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In 1988, King Hussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament and renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank.

<h3 id="declaration-of-independence-1988">Declaration of Independence (1988)</h3>

<p>Declassified diplomatic documents reveal that in 1974, on the eve of the UN debate that granted the PLO an observer status, some parts of the PLO leadership were considering to proclaim the formation of a Palestinian <a href="government_in_exile" title="wikilink">government in exile</a> at some point.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> This plan, however, was not carried out.</p>

It was read by <a href="Yasser_Arafat" title="wikilink">Yasser Arafat</a> at the closing session of the 19th PNC to a standing ovation.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Upon completing the reading of the declaration, Arafat, as <a href="Chairman_of_the_Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="wikilink">Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization</a> assumed the title of &quot;President of Palestine.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Referring to &quot;the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their <a href="right_to_self-determination" title="wikilink">right to self-determination</a>,&quot; the declaration recalled the <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lausanne</a> (1923) and <a href="UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_181" title="wikilink">UN General Assembly Resolution 181</a> as supporting the rights of Palestinians and Palestine.

The population of the state was referred to by the statement: &quot;The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinians wherever they may be&quot;. The state was defined as an Arab country by the statement: &quot;The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the Arab nation&quot;. The declaration was accompanied by a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of <a href="UN_Security_Council_Resolution_242" title="wikilink">UN Security Council Resolution 242</a>. This call was later termed &quot;the Historic Compromise&quot;,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> as it implied acceptance of the &quot;two-state solution&quot;, namely that it no longer questioned the legitimacy of the State of Israel.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The PNC's political communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; accompanying the declaration called only for withdrawal from &quot;<a href="East_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Arab Jerusalem</a>&quot; and the other &quot;Arab territories occupied.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> <a href="Yasser_Arafat" title="wikilink">Yasser Arafat</a>'s statements in Geneva a month later<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of the declaration, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) convened, inviting Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the PLO to give an address. An UNGA resolution was adopted &quot;acknowledging the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988,&quot; and it was further decided that &quot;the designation 'Palestine' should be used in place of the designation 'Palestine Liberation Organization' in the <a href="United_Nations_system" title="wikilink">United Nations system</a>.&quot; One hundred and four states voted for this resolution, forty-four abstained, and two &lt;U+2013&gt; the United States and Israel &lt;U+2013&gt; voted against.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> By mid-December, 75 states had recognized Palestine, rising to 89 states by February 1989.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 1988 declaration, the PNC empowered its central council to form a <a href="government-in-exile" class="uri" title="wikilink">government-in-exile</a> when appropriate, and called upon its executive committee to perform the duties of the government-in-exile until its establishment.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p>Under the terms of the <a href="Oslo_Accords" title="wikilink">Oslo Accords</a> signed between Israel and the PLO, the latter assumed control over the <a href="Jericho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jericho</a> area of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 17 May 1994. On September 28, 1995, following the signing of the <a href="Interim_Agreement_on_the_West_Bank_and_the_Gaza_Strip" title="wikilink">Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip</a>, Israeli military forces withdrew from the West Bank towns of <a href="Nablus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nablus</a>, <a href="Ramallah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramallah</a>, <a href="Jericho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jericho</a>, <a href="Jenin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jenin</a>, <a href="Tulkarem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tulkarem</a>, <a href="Qalqilya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qalqilya</a> and <a href="Bethlehem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bethlehem</a>.

<p>An analysis outlining the relationship between the PLO, the PNA (or PA), Palestine and Israel in light of the interim arrangements set out in the Oslo Accords begins by stating that, &quot;Palestine may best be described as a transitional association between the PA and the PLO.&quot; It goes on to explain that this transitional association accords the PA responsibility for local government and the PLO responsibility for representation of the Palestinian people in the international arena, while prohibiting it from concluding international agreements that affect the status of the <a href="Occupied_Palestinian_territory" title="wikilink">occupied territories</a>.

These instances of foreign relations undertaken by the PA signify that the Interim Agreement is part of a larger on-going peace process, and that the restrictions on the foreign policy operations of the PA conflict with the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, now a norm with a nature of jus cogens, which includes a right to engage in international relations with other peoples.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>In April, the UN's co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process issued a report lauding the Palestinian Authority, describing &quot;aspects of its administration as sufficient for an independent state.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> It echoed similar assessments published the week prior by the <a href="International_Monetary_Fund" title="wikilink">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a href="World_Bank" title="wikilink">World Bank</a>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>After 1967, a number of legal arguments were advanced which dismissed the right of Palestinians to self-determination and statehood. They generally proposed that Palestine was a land void of a legitimate sovereign and supported Israeli claims to the remaining territory of the Palestine Mandate.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Historian and journalist, <a href="Gershom_Gorenberg" title="wikilink">Gershom Gorenberg</a>, says that outside of the pro-settlement community in Israel, these positions are considered quirky. He says that, while the Israeli government has used them for <a href="Public_relations" title="wikilink">PR</a> purposes abroad, it takes entirely different positions when arguing real legal cases before the Israeli Supreme Court. In 2005 Israel decided to dismantle all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank. Gorenberg notes, the government's decision was challenged in the Supreme Court by settlers, and the government won the case by noting the settlements were in territory whose legal status was that of 'belligerent territory'. The government argued that the settlers should have known the settlements were only temporary.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Most UN member states questioned the claim that Israel held better title to the land than the inhabitants, and stressed that statehood was an inalienable right of the Palestinian people.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Legal experts, like David John Ball, concluded that &quot;the Palestinians, based on the principles of self-determination and the power of the U.N., appear to hold better title to the territory.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The International Court of Justice subsequently reaffirmed the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the prohibition under customary and conventional international law against acquisition of territory by war.</p>
<p>The Israeli Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, cited a case involving Gaza and said that &quot;The Judea and Samaria areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The legal representative of the state in the area is the military commander. He is not the sovereign in the territory held in belligerent occupation. His power is granted him by public international law regarding belligerent occupation. The legal meaning of this view is twofold: first, Israeli law does not apply in these areas. They have not been &quot;annexed&quot; to Israel. Second, the legal regime which applies in these areas is determined by public international law regarding belligerent occupation.&quot;<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>The court said most Israelis do not have ownership of the land on which they built their houses and businesses in the territory &quot;They acquired their rights from the military commander, or from persons acting on his behalf. Neither the military commander nor those acting on his behalf are owners of the property, and they cannot transfer rights better than those they have. To the extent that the Israelis built their homes and assets on land which is not private ('state land'), that land is not owned by the military commander. His authority is defined in regulation 55 of The Hague Regulations. . . . The State of Israel acts . . . as the administrator of the state property and as <a href="usufruct" title="wikilink">usufructuary</a> of it.&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="declaration-and-act-of-state-doctrine">Declaration and Act of State Doctrine</h4>
<p>Many states have recognized the State of Palestine since 1988. Under the principles of customary international law, when a government is recognized by another government, recognition is retroactive in effect, and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Stephen Talmon notes that many countries have a formal policy of recognizing states, not their governments. In practice, they usually make no formal declarations regarding recognition. He cites several examples including a memorandum on US recognition policy and practice, dated 25 September 1981 which said that recognition would be implied by the U.S. Government's dealings with the new government.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Many countries have expressed their intention to enter into relations with the State of Palestine. The United States formally recognized the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a country in 1997 at the request of the Palestinian Authority. At that time it asked the public to take notice of that fact through announcements it placed in the Federal Register.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The USAID West Bank/Gaza,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> has been tasked with &quot;state-building&quot; projects in the areas of democracy, governance, resources, and infrastructure.

<p>The U.S. State Department <em>Digest of International Law</em> says that the terms of the <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lausanne</a> provided for the application of the principles of state succession to the <a href="League_of_Nations_mandate#Class_A_mandates" title="wikilink">&quot;A&quot; Mandates</a>. The <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a> (1920) provisionally recognized the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also required Germany to recognize the disposition of the former Ottoman territories and to recognize the new states laid down within their boundaries. The <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lausanne</a> required the newly created states that acquired the territory to pay annuities on the Ottoman public debt, and to assume responsibility for the administration of concessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. A dispute regarding the status of the territories was settled by an Arbitrator appointed by the Council of the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>. It was decided that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created states according to the terms of the applicable post-war treaties. In its <em>Judgment No. 5, The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions</em>, the <a href="Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice" title="wikilink">Permanent Court of International Justice</a> also decided that Palestine was responsible as the successor state for concessions granted by Ottoman authorities.

<p>Article 62 (LXII) of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July 1878<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> dealt with religious freedom and civil and political rights in all parts of the Ottoman Empire.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The guarantees have frequently been referred to as &quot;religious rights&quot; or &quot;minority rights&quot;. However, the guarantees included a prohibition against discrimination in civil and political matters. Difference of religion could not be alleged against any person as a ground for exclusion or incapacity in matters relating to the enjoyment of civil or political rights, admission to public employments, functions, and honors, or the exercise of the various professions and industries, &quot;in any locality whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p>The resolution of the San Remo Conference contained a safeguarding clause for all of those rights. The conference accepted the terms of the Mandate with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the process-verbal a legal undertaking by the Mandatory Power that it would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> The draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and all of the post-war peace treaties contained clauses for the protection of minorities.

<p>Jacob Robinson was a legal advisor to the United Nations delegation of the Jewish Agency for Palestine during the special session of the General Assembly in 1947.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> He advised the Zionist Executive that the provisional states had come into existence as a result of the resolution of November 29, 1947.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>L.C. Green explained that &quot;recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government.&quot;<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>Alex Takkenberg writes that while &quot;[...] there is no doubt that the entity 'Palestine' should be considered a state <em><a href="in_statu_nascendi" title="wikilink">in statu nascendi</a></em> and although it is increasingly likely that the ongoing peace process will eventually culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian state, it is premature to conclude that statehood, as defined by international law, is at present (spring 1997) firmly established.&quot;<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Referring to the four criteria of statehood, as outlined in the 1933 <a href="Montevideo_Convention" title="wikilink">Montevideo Convention</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; that is, a permanent population, a defined territory, government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states &lt;U+2013&gt; Takkenberg states that the entity known as Palestine does not fully satisfy this criteria.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>Conversely <a href="John_V._Whitbeck" title="wikilink">John V.

[...] Yet a Palestinian executive and <a href="Palestinian_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">legislature</a>, democratically elected with the enthusiastic approval of the international community, now exercises 'effective control' over a portion of Palestinian territory in which the great majority of the state's population lives.

<p>For <a href="John_Quigley" title="wikilink">John Quigley</a> Palestine's existence as a state predates the 1988 declaration. Tracing Palestine's status as an international entity back to the collapse of the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> after <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, he recalls that the <a href="Palestine_Mandate" title="wikilink">Palestine Mandate</a> (1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1948), an arrangement made under Article 22 of the Covenant of the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>, held as its &quot;ultimate objective&quot;, the &quot;<a href="self-determination" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-determination</a> and independence of the people concerned.&quot; He says that in explicitly referring to the Covenant, the 1988 declaration was reaffirming an existing Palestinian statehood.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Noting that Palestine under the Mandate entered into <a href="Bilateral_treaty" title="wikilink">bilateral treaties</a>, including one with <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>, the Mandatory power, he cites this as an example of its &quot;sovereignty&quot; at that time. He also notes the corollary of the <a href="Stimson_Doctrine" title="wikilink">Stimson Doctrine</a> and the customary prohibition on the use of force contained in the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, &quot;[a]n entity does not necessarily cease to be a state even if all of its territory has been occupied by a foreign power&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Robert Weston Ash says that Quigley&lt;U+2019&gt;s analysis of the declaration that the Palestinian Authority provided to the International Criminal Court failed to explain a number of key issues. He says the &lt;U+201C&gt;Palestinian people&lt;U+201D&gt; to whom sovereignty reverted upon the departure of the British would have included both Jews and Arabs. He suggests that establishes a colorable Jewish &lt;U+2014&gt;as well as Arab&lt;U+2014&gt; claim to all of Palestine which tends to refute Professor Quigley&lt;U+2019&gt;s contention that there are no other claimants to that territory. Ash says there are segments of Israeli society that continue to view &lt;U+201C&gt;Judea and Samaria&lt;U+201D&gt; as areas promised to the Jews by the Balfour Declaration and says that the Geneva Convention is not applicable to Israel's presence in those territories. He cites Yehuda Blum's &quot;Missing Reversioner&quot; and Eugene Rostow's related claim that &lt;U+201C&gt;The right of the Jewish people to settle in Palestine has never been terminated for the West Bank.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Quigley has said that the International Court of Justice findings in the &quot;Wall&quot; case regarding the applicability of the Geneva Convention discredited once and for all, as a legal matter, the &lt;U+2018&gt;missing reversioner&lt;U+2019&gt; argument.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The International Criminal Court has published a summary of arguments which says that some submissions consider that it is clear that the Palestinian National Authority cannot be regarded as a &lt;U+2018&gt;State&lt;U+2019&gt;, and that some submit that Palestine is recognized as a State by many States and many institutions.

<p>Paul De Waart says that the Quartet, particularly the United States, as well as western states, do not consider Palestine to be a state as yet.

It emerged in the 1950s during the process of <a href="decolonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">decolonization</a> as a basic constituent of the right to self-determination and an essential and inherent element of state sovereignty.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>The International Court of Justice noted that a number of agreements have been signed since 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and that those agreements required Israel to transfer to Palestinian authorities certain powers and responsibilities exercised in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by its military authorities and civil administration. The Court said that Israel is under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Israel&lt;U+2019&gt;s representative at the United Nations subsequently said that under agreements reached between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority <em>already exercised jurisdiction</em> over many natural resources, while interim cooperation and arrangements were in place for others.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="israeli-response">Israeli response</h4>
<p>In response to the proposed Palestinian declaration, Israel began considering whether to annex major <a href="Israeli_settlement" title="wikilink">Israeli settlement</a> blocs and uninhabited areas in response. The idea was raised by Infrastructure Minister <a href="Uzi_Landau" title="wikilink">Uzi Landau</a> during a <a href="Yisrael_Beiteinu" title="wikilink">Yisrael Beiteinu</a> convention in Jerusalem. A rally was organized in the Knesset to promote annexing the settlements, with the feature speakers being MKs <a href="Danny_Danon" title="wikilink">Danny Danon</a> and <a href="Yuli_Edelstein" title="wikilink">Yuli Edelstein</a>. Top right-wing academics and former Foreign Minister <a href="Moshe_Arens" title="wikilink">Moshe Arens</a> were also expected to speak. MK Danon began preparing two bills, one of them incorporating Israeli settlement blocs and uninhabited areas into Israel, and the other one to repeal the <a href="Oslo_Accords" title="wikilink">Oslo Accords</a>.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Danon also suggested that Israel cut off tax transfers, along with diplomatic and security assistance to the Palestinian Authority as a punitive measure.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
