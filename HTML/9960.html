It is MADD&lt;U+2019&gt;s longest running and most visible public awareness project. During the holiday season, drivers are encouraged to tie MADD red ribbons to visible locations on their vehicles, or place window decals on their vehicles&lt;U+2019&gt; windows.

<p>The artists who formed the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. Inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring American soldiers serving in the Gulf war, the color red was chosen for its, &quot;connection to blood and the idea of passion -- not only anger, but love, like a valentine.&quot; First worn publicly by <a href="Jeremy_Irons" title="wikilink">Jeremy Irons</a> at the 1991 Tony Awards,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the ribbon soon became renowned as an international symbol of AIDS awareness.</p>
