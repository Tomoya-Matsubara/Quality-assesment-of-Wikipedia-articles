<p>The <strong>legal history of cannabis in the United States</strong> relates to the regulation of <a href="marijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">marijuana</a> use for medical or recreational purposes in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Prohibitions on the use of <em><a href="Cannabis_sativa" title="wikilink">Cannabis sativa</a></em> as a drug arose in many states from 1906 and onward. By the mid-1930s were regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the <a href="Uniform_State_Narcotic_Drug_Act" title="wikilink">Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1970s many <a href="Places_that_have_decriminalized_cannabis_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">places</a> in the United States started to <a href="Decriminalization_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">decriminalize cannabis</a>. Most places that have decriminalized cannabis have one or more of <a href="Civil_penalty" title="wikilink">civil fines</a>, drug education, drug treatment in place of <a href="incarceration" class="uri" title="wikilink">incarceration</a>, <a href="Criminal_law" title="wikilink">criminal</a> charges for possession of small amounts of cannabis, or have made various cannabis offenses the lowest priority for <a href="Policing_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">law enforcement</a>. In the 1990s many places began to legalize <a href="medical_cannabis" title="wikilink">medical cannabis</a>, which conflicts with federal laws; cannabis is a <a href="List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US)" title="wikilink">Schedule I</a> drug according to the <a href="Controlled_Substances_Act" title="wikilink">Controlled Substances Act</a> of 1970, which classified cannabis as having high potential for abuse, no medical use, and not safe to use under medical supervision. Multiple efforts to <a href="Cannabis_rescheduling_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">reschedule cannabis</a> under the Act have failed, and the <a href="United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> has ruled in <em><a href="United_States_v._Oakland_Cannabis_Buyers&#39;_Coop" title="wikilink">United States v.

<h2 id="early-history">Early history</h2>
<p>In 1619 <a href="Jamestown,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Jamestown</a> colony law declared that all settlers were required to grow hemp or cannabis.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1797 George Washington grew <a href="hemp" class="uri" title="wikilink">hemp</a> (cannabis) for fiber production at Mount Vernon as one of his primary crops. The 44-gun frigate <a href="USS_Constitution" title="wikilink">USS Constitution</a>, or 'Old Ironsides', took over 60 tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable 25 inches in circumference. The <a href="Conestoga_wagon" title="wikilink">Conestoga</a> wagons and prairie schooners of pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed the very word 'canvas' is derived from 'cannabis'.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Prohibitions on the use of <em><a href="Cannabis_sativa" title="wikilink">Cannabis sativa</a></em> as a drug arose in many states from 1906 onwards. By the mid-1930s cannabis and <a href="marijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">marijuana</a> were regulated as a drug in every state by laws instituted through the <a href="Uniform_State_Narcotic_Drug_Act" title="wikilink">Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criminalization-1900s">Criminalization (1900s)</h2>
<p>The first significant instance of cannabis regulation appeared in the <a href="District_of_Columbia" title="wikilink">District of Columbia</a> in 1906, though this law was not an outright prohibition.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Regulation of cannabis followed in Massachusetts (1911), New York (1914), and Maine (1914). Simultaneously tensions were building in the western and southwestern states regarding the influx of Mexicans to America. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later in that decade negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. In 1913 California passed the first state marijuana prohibition law, criminalizing the preparation of hemp and its products, the phrase &quot;Indian Hemp&quot; (<em><a href="Cannabis_indica" title="wikilink">Cannabis indica</a></em>) is sometimes used or &quot;loco weed&quot;. Other states followed with marijuana prohibition laws including: Wyoming (1915); Texas (1919); Iowa (1923); Nevada (1923); Oregon (1923); Washington (1923); Arkansas (1923); and Nebraska (1927).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="indian-hemp-regulation-1925">Indian hemp regulation (1925)</h3>
<p>In 1925 the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> supported regulation of Indian hemp, also known as <a href="hashish" class="uri" title="wikilink">hashish</a>, in the <a href="International_Opium_Convention" title="wikilink">International Opium Convention</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The convention banned exportation of &quot;Indian hemp&quot;, and the preparations derived therefrom, to countries that had prohibited its use and required importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required &quot;exclusively for medical or scientific purposes&quot;. The convention did not ban trade in fibers and other similar products from European hemp, and traditionally grown in the United States, which are very tall with a low <a href="THC" class="uri" title="wikilink">THC</a> content. According to the 1912 edition of a Swedish encyclopaedia the European hemp grown for its fibers lacks the THC content that characterizes Indian hemp.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="uniform-state-narcotic-act-1925u20131932">Uniform State Narcotic Act (1925&lt;U+2013&gt;1932)</h3>
<p>The <a href="Uniform_State_Narcotic_Act" title="wikilink">Uniform State Narcotic Act</a>, first tentative draft in 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, was a result of work by the <a href="National_Conference_of_Commissioners_on_Uniform_State_Laws" title="wikilink">National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws</a>. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed The <a href="Harrison_Act" title="wikilink">Harrison Act</a> in 1914 and The Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Narcotics" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> encouraged state governments to adopt the act.

The US, led by Anslinger, had attempted to include the criminalization of all activities in the treaty &lt;U+2013&gt; cultivation, production, manufacture and distribution &lt;U+2013&gt; related to the use of opium, coca (and its derivatives) and cannabis for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. Many countries opposed this and the focus remained on illicit trafficking. Article 2 of the Convention called upon signatory countries to use their national criminal law systems to &quot;severely&quot; punish, &quot;particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty&quot; acts directly related to drug trafficking.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The US refused to sign the final version because it considered the convention too weak, especially in relation to extradition, extraterritoriality and the confiscation of trafficking profits.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1916 <a href="United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="wikilink">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and <a href="Lyster_Hoxie_Dewey" title="wikilink">Lyster H. Dewey</a> created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 &quot;Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material&quot;, in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was &quot;favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood&quot;. Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In 2003 95% of the hemp hurds in <a href="EU" class="uri" title="wikilink">EU</a> were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material.

<p>In 1916 the United States Department of Agriculture assumed, partly based on the incorrect finding about hemp hurds of USDA Bulletin No. 404, that the production of hemp would rise in the US. In reality production fell until 1933, due to competition with other fibers and imports. In 1933 production was only around 500 tons of hemp fiber per year. 1934&lt;U+2013&gt;1935 the cultivation of hemp began to increase, but still with a very low volume compared with other types of fibers and with no significant increase in production of paper from hemp.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>There was also a misconception about the intoxicating effects of hemp because it has the same active substance, <a href="Tetrahydrocannabinol" title="wikilink">THC</a>, which is in all cannabis strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930's, <a href="THC" class="uri" title="wikilink">THC</a> was not yet fully identified.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The methods FBN used for predicting the psychoactive effect of different samples of cannabis and hemp therefore gave confusing results.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

The respondents argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within the state of California, pursuant to California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce and as such, could not be legitimately regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that, because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where persons are using medical cannabis in full compliance with state law, those persons can still be punished by federal authorities for violating federal law.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>To combat state-approved medical cannabis legislation, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) routinely targets and arrests medical cannabis patients as well as seizing medical cannabis and the business assets of growers and medical dispensaries. However, the Obama administration has indicated that this practice may potentially be curtailed.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1978 Robert Randall sued the federal government for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his <a href="glaucoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">glaucoma</a>. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the <a href="University_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">University of Mississippi</a> and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H. W.

Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to seven people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the <a href="George_W._Bush_administration" title="wikilink">George W.

Possession of multiple containers of any weight, or possession of more than one ounce can sometimes add the additional crime &quot;Intent to Sell&quot;. In some cases people who have no marijuana, but are caught at the scene of a drug bust, are charged with &quot;Frequenting&quot;.
