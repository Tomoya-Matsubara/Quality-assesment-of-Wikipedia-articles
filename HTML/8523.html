<p><strong><em>Hylton v. United States</em></strong>, <a href="Case_citation" title="wikilink">3 U.S. 171</a> (1796), was an early <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> case in which the Court held that a tax on carriages did not violate the <a href="direct_tax_clause" title="wikilink">direct tax clause</a> by defining the carriage tax as an &quot;excise&quot; instead of a &quot;direct tax&quot; that would have had to be apportioned among the states by population. This interpretation of the federal tax power lasted until modified in <em><a href="Pollock_v._Farmers&#39;_Loan_&amp;_Trust_Co." title="wikilink">Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.</a></em> (1895), in which the Supreme Court held an unapportioned 1894 federal income tax on interest, dividends and rents to be unconstitutional because the tax was a &quot;direct tax&quot; that had to be apportioned. The <em>Pollock</em> decision was overturned by the <a href="Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Sixteenth Amendment</a> (1913), which allows the Congress to impose a tax on incomes from &quot;whatever source derived&quot; without any requirement for apportionment.</p>
<p>The Justices at the time, rather than issue an opinion of the Court, instead issued <a href="seriatim" class="uri" title="wikilink">seriatim</a> opinions, with each writing separately and reading their own analysis in turn. This case was the first time <a href="Judicial_Review" title="wikilink">Judicial Review</a> came up in the United States Supreme Court. The Court heard the case about upholding the federal carriage tax, and found it constitutional. The power of <a href="Judicial_Review" title="wikilink">Judicial Review</a> was not controversial until <em><a href="Marbury_v._Madison" title="wikilink">Marbury v. Madison</a></em> in 1803.</p>
<p><a href="Alexander_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Alexander Hamilton</a> appeared before court for the government, arguing that the tax was a valid use of the power of Congress. Justice James Iredell wrote, two days after the event: &quot;Mr. Hamilton spoke in our Court, attended by the most crowded audience I ever saw there, both Houses of Congress being almost deserted on the occasion. Though he was in very ill health, he spoke with astonishing ability, and in a most pleasing manner, and was listened to with the profoundest attention. His speech lasted about three hours.&quot;</p>
