<p><strong>Philip-Jon Haarsma</strong> (), more commonly known as <strong>PJ Haarsma</strong>, is a <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> born <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> author best known for his creation of the <em>Rings of Orbis</em> <a href="Fictional_universe" title="wikilink">universe</a>, which encompasses <em><a href="The_Softwire" title="wikilink">The Softwire</a></em> series of books. Haarsma created a free, online <a href="role-playing_game" title="wikilink">role-playing game</a>, also called the <em>Rings of Orbis</em>, set in the same universe. Both the book-series and the game target young, often reluctant readers in an attempt to encourage them by rewarding them for reading.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Haarsma developed a school presentation program in which he discusses <em><a href="The_Softwire" title="wikilink">The Softwire</a></em> books, <a href="astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, and other <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> and <a href="science_fact" title="wikilink">science fact</a> topics. He is also one of the co-founders of The Kids Need to Read Foundation, an United States Internal Revenue Code <a href="501(c)(3)" class="uri" title="wikilink">501(c)(3)</a> tax exempt public charity that purchases books to donate to underfunded schools and libraries.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Philip-Jon Haarsma was born on June 5, 1964, in <a href="Georgetown,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Georgetown, Ontario</a>. Though he was named after his grandfathers, Philip and Jon, he went simply by &quot;Jon&quot; while growing up. Later, while attending <a href="McMaster_University" title="wikilink">McMaster University</a> in <a href="Hamilton,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, where he received a <a href="Bachelor_of_Science" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Science</a> degree, he began to use his initials, &quot;PJ&quot;, and his books are published under the name &quot;PJ Haarsma&quot;.</p>
<p>After he moved to the United States in 1989, Haarsma worked as a fashion and commercial photographer in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> and <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a>. He received many photography awards, including an honorable mention at the <a href="Cannes_Lion_Awards" title="wikilink">Cannes Lion Awards</a> in 1996. Haarsma owned a small production company called Redbear Films, Inc. The company produced one movie (<em>Devious Beings</em>, 2002) and several corporate ads for clients such as <a href="Hewlett_Packard" title="wikilink">Hewlett Packard</a> and <a href="Nokia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nokia</a>. For 15 years, Redbear Films focused on the production of advertisements.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Haarsma lives in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> with his wife, sci-fi <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> artist Marisa Grieco,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and their daughter Skylar.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rings-of-orbis"><em>Rings of Orbis</em></h2>
<p>At the age of 38, Haarsma was not satisfied with his professional life. He began to keep a daily journal, writing about anything (and everything) that came to his mind&lt;U+2014&gt;until eventually &quot;Johnny T came onto [his] page.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Johnny T is the main character, Johnny Turnbull, of Haarsma's <em><a href="The_Softwire" title="wikilink">The Softwire</a></em> series. Haarsma chose to give <em>The Softwire</em> a sci-fi setting due to a love of science fiction, and to target a young adult audience with his novels so that children could discover and learn to enjoy the genre.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Softwire</em> is actually a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> As a teenager, he worked at his parents' <a href="ceramic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceramic</a> <a href="factory" class="uri" title="wikilink">factory</a> during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a <a href="kiln" class="uri" title="wikilink">kiln</a> room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, there is a more prominent influence on the premise of <em>The Softwire</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed himself of moving to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a>, <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> and <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, Haarsma witnessed <a href="immigrant" title="wikilink">immigrants</a> struggling to get by. He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is <em>this journey</em> (and struggle) that is prevalent in <em><a href="The_Softwire" title="wikilink">The Softwire</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>The Softwire</em>, a group of human children are orphaned in outer space. They are forced into <a href="indentured_servitude" title="wikilink">indentured servitude</a> on the Rings of Orbis, four planet-like rings around a <a href="wormhole" class="uri" title="wikilink">wormhole</a>. They must spend four years as slaves or <em>knudniks</em> before they are eligible to become Citizens. Each year they are the property of a new owner on a separate ring: <em>Orbis 1, Orbis 2, Orbis 3, and Orbis 4</em>. They are forced into labor to do whatever task their new owner requires. </p>
<p>When the children arrive, they soon discover that thirteen-year-old Johnny Turnbull (JT), is the first human <em>softwire</em>, a boy who has the ability to enter any computer with just his mind. To the older Citizens, a slave who can enter at will the massive computer which controls the Rings of Orbis makes JT very valuable and drives the Rings to the brink of war. As the central computer begins to malfunction, the Citizens connive, conspire, and even kill to own JT and his sister.</p>
<p>While there are other humans besides the children on the Rings, the majority of the inhabitants are of alien species. <em>The Keepers</em> are an intelligent species of two-headed beings who act as the overseers. Other species encountered include <em>Belarans</em>, <em>Choi</em>, <em>Solinns</em>, and <em>Trefaldoors</em>, all of which become interesting roles for young players to choose from in the game,<em>Rings of Orbis</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rings-of-orbis-game"><em>Rings of Orbis</em> game</h3>
<p>Haarsma's novels are accompanied by an free, online, role-playing game called <em>Rings of Orbis</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which acts as a visual companion to the books and is set in the same universe. Players are sometimes required to use information from the books in order to solve puzzles and to unlock areas within the game.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Pairing a video game with a novel for young readers, Haarsma says, &lt;U+201C&gt;brings the book into their world, as opposed to going the other way around.&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Haarsma and a team of artists also created many different alien races specifically for the game. The team includes Haarsma's wife Marisa Grieco, Igor Knezevic,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Stephan_Martini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" title="wikilink">Stephan Martini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a>, Dwayne Harris,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and Neil Blevins.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The game works to encourage reluctant readers, especially boys, by giving them an interactive game through which to relate to the mysteries found within the books themselves. Players complete quests and earn in-game currency which they can then spend on in-game items designed by Haarsma, all the while they compete to become the best Citizen of the Rings of Orbis.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 2008, the game was featured in a front page <a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a> article about encouraging reluctant readers with <a href="role-playing_games" title="wikilink">video games</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="kids-need-to-read">Kids Need to Read</h3>
<p><img src="KNTR-Founders2008.gif" title="fig:KNTR founders Fillion and Haarsma" alt="KNTR founders Fillion and Haarsma" />While speaking at schools across the United States, Haarsma noticed how some school librarians were having trouble finding funds to purchase <em>The Softwire</em> books after a demand had been created by Haarsma's visit. Many of the librarians were struggling to fill their shelves with books. In June 2007, Haarsma and a friend, actor <a href="Nathan_Fillion" title="wikilink">Nathan Fillion</a>, approached a group of Fillion's fans with the idea for a project that would work to purchase books for underfunded schools, as well as <a href="nonprofit" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonprofit</a> institutions which gave books directly to children. The group took to the idea and focused their energies into getting the project off the ground. The Kids Need to Read project went public in August 2007.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2008, the process to transform the project into a legal foundation began, and the fan group was separated from the developing organization. On May 22, 2008, The Kids Need to Read Foundation (KNTR)<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> was incorporated in the state of <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. KNTR became an Internal Revenue Code <a href="501(c)(3)" class="uri" title="wikilink">501(c)(3)</a> <a href="tax_exempt" title="wikilink">tax exempt</a> <a href="public_charity" title="wikilink">public charity</a> on September 18, 2008, with a retroactive exemption date of May 22, 2008. The organization is supported by a global volunteer base.</p>
<p>Funds were initially raised through <a href="ebay" title="wikilink">eBay auctions</a> of <em><a href="Firefly_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Firefly</a></em> and <em><a href="Serenity_(film)" title="wikilink">Serenity</a></em> autographed memorabilia, and <em>The Softwire</em> books and items, and other science fiction and <a href="literary" class="uri" title="wikilink">literary</a> themed items.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Fundraising" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fundraising</a> efforts have expanded to include support by various sci-fi businesses and organizations. KNTR representatives also attend <a href="convention_(meeting)" title="wikilink">conventions</a>, both <a href="Comic_book_convention" title="wikilink">comic book</a> and <a href="Science_fiction_convention" title="wikilink">sci-fi</a>, to accept donations and to spread information about the organization.</p>
<p>Although the foundation separated from its fan beginnings, many <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> fan organizations remain supportive. <a href="Browncoat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Browncoat</a> groups (fans of Fillion's ill-fated television series <em>Firefly</em>) are some of the largest supporters of The Kids Need to Read Foundation. Several of these groups have organized fundraisers that include <a href="Serenity_(comics)" title="wikilink"><em>Serenity</em> comic book</a> sales, auctions, and <a href="Jayne_Cobb" title="wikilink">Jayne hat</a> knit-a-thon pledge drives.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Non-Browncoat groups participate in supporting the organization as well. The Dune Sea Garrison<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> of the <a href="501st_Legion" title="wikilink">501st Legion</a> (<a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a> fan group) performed a <a href="USO" class="uri" title="wikilink">USO</a>-style show at the <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix</a> <a href="Comic_Con" title="wikilink">Cactus Comicon</a> in January 2008 to raise funds to benefit KNTR. SpazDog Comics and Quantum Mechanix<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> have donated the proceeds from several item sales to KNTR.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>All funds are then used to purchase books from the foundation's official book list, a list which is continually updated by a professional children's book buyer. The titles chosen are well-reviewed and many are recommended for children who are reluctant readers.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> KNTR has made book donations to thirty-nine schools and libraries in addition to three multiple library systems. KNTR facilitated a substantial donation of three thousand books by the Phoenix Book Company to the <a href="New_Orleans_Public_Library" title="wikilink">Friends of the New Orleans Public Library</a>, to help with recuperation after <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The Odessa Brown Children's Clinic in <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a> was the recipient of a donation amounting to four hundred forty books in February 2008.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> This clinic, as well as the North Public Health Clinic in Seattle, have received recurring donations from KNTR.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="school-visits">School visits</h3>

<p><img src="PJ_Haarsma_Presentation.jpg" title="fig:Students involved in presentation at Barbara Bush Elementary - Mesa, AZ|250px" alt="Students involved in presentation at Barbara Bush Elementary - Mesa, AZ|250px" /> Haarsma takes part in school visits to promote his book and encourage imagination and reading in the school children. The presentation he presents lasts fifty minutes, and discussions center around <a href="space_travel" title="wikilink">space travel</a>, <a href="space_exploration" title="wikilink">exploration</a>, <em>The Rings of Orbis</em> universe, and other interactive topics, thus allowing for questions from the students at the conclusion.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> To help illustrate the scientific topics, <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> supplied Haarsma with space related information to present.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>During his presentation, Haarsma involves the children in various interactive activities. These include a <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>-style acting <a href="audition" class="uri" title="wikilink">audition</a>, an <a href="alien" class="uri" title="wikilink">alien</a> <a href="ghost_story" title="wikilink">ghost story</a>, and a demonstration of the vast distances in space. The activities are designed to engage the children's imaginations and to make them feel a part of the presentation.</p>
<p>The responses to his visits from both students and teachers are positive. The majority of the feedback involves praise and thanks. Haarsma has received many stories of previously reluctant readers being observed reading <em>The Softwire</em> books during school <a href="recess_(break)" title="wikilink">recess</a>.</p>
