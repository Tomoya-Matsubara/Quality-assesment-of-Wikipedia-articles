<p><strong><em>The Mask</em></strong> (also known as <em>Eyes of Hell</em>) is a <a href="1961_in_film" title="wikilink">1961</a> low-budget Canadian <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror film</a> produced in <a href="3-D_film" title="wikilink">3-D</a> by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> It was directed by Julian Roffman, and stars Paul Stevens, Claudette Nevins and Bill Walker.</p>
<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>

<p>The story concerns a young scientist, Dr. Allen Barnes (Stevens), who obtains a mysterious ancient tribal mask. Whenever he puts on the mask, Barnes experiences weird dream-like visions which become increasingly disturbing and violent. The visions begin to alter Barnes' personality, and eventually drive him insane.</p>
<p>The premise bears some similarity to <em><a href="The_Mask" title="wikilink">The Mask</a></em> comic book series later initiated by <a href="Dark_Horse_Comics" title="wikilink">Dark Horse Comics</a> in 1987, and to the 1994 feature <em><a href="The_Mask_(film)" title="wikilink">The Mask</a></em> starring <a href="Jim_Carrey" title="wikilink">Jim Carrey</a>, which was based on the comic books. </p>
<h2 id="put-the-mask-on-now">&quot;Put the mask on, NOW!&quot;</h2>
<p><em>The Mask</em> is notable chiefly for its surreal use of 3-D <a href="cinematography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cinematography</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the story is presented in conventional black-and-white. However, whenever Dr. Barnes is about to put on the mask, Barnes' voice (heavily processed with reverb) urges the viewer to &quot;Put the mask on, NOW!&quot; This was the cue for theatergoers to put on the red/green 3-D glasses (shaped like masks) which they were given upon entering the theater. The terrifying visions experienced by Dr. Barnes were then presented in <a href="anaglyph_image" title="wikilink">anaglyphic</a> 3-D.</p>
<p>The 3-D sequences, four in all, last only a few minutes each. They were designed by montage expert Slavko Vorkapich, and feature an array of distinctively psychedelic visuals, some of which are mildly gruesome. A crude electronic music score (billed as &quot;Electro Magic Sound&quot; in publicity materials) enhances the strangeness of the 3-D scenes.</p>
<h2 id="video-release">Video release</h2>
<p>The 3-D effects in <em>The Mask</em> come across unusually well when shown on television, making it one of the better examples of anaglyphic 3-D video available.</p>
<p><em>The Mask</em> was frequently exhibited in 3-D on US broadcast and cable TV in the 1980s. It has also been issued in 3-D on both <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a> and <a href="LaserDisc" class="uri" title="wikilink">LaserDisc</a> home video formats. As of 2006, it has yet to receive an authorized release on <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>.</p>
