He earlier sculpted the <a href="effigy" class="uri" title="wikilink">effigy</a> of Queen Elizabeth II which has appeared on coins in the UK and <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> coins since 1998.

<blockquote>
<p>The magnificence of this new memorial will, at long last, provide a fitting recognition for all those killed on duty since the end of the Second World War. It does not differentiate between those killed in the heat of battle or on a training exercise, by terrorist action or on peace-keeping missions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the Memorial in Staffordshire, a memorial without names will be added to the South Cloister of <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>, dedicated to members of the Armed Forces killed in conflict and the members of the <a href="Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary" title="wikilink">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a> and the <a href="Merchant_Navy" title="wikilink">Merchant Navy</a> who died in conflict zones since the end of the Second World War; and <a href="roll_of_honour" title="wikilink">rolls of honour</a> will be displayed at the <a href="St_Martin-in-the-Fields" title="wikilink">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> (for the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>) and the chapel of the <a href="Royal_Hospital_Chelsea" title="wikilink">Royal Hospital Chelsea</a> (for the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>), in addition to the existing Rolls of Honour for the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> at <a href="St_Clement_Danes" title="wikilink">St Clement Danes</a> in <a href="Strand,_London" title="wikilink">the Strand</a>.</p>

<p>The Memorial cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;6 million to build, principally funded by sales of a commemorative <a href="Battle_of_Trafalgar" title="wikilink">Trafalgar</a> coin sold by the <a href="Royal_Mint" title="wikilink">Royal Mint</a>, and grants from the <a href="Millennium_Commission" title="wikilink">Millennium Commission</a>. The Memorial takes the form of an earth <a href="tumulus" class="uri" title="wikilink">tumulus</a> (mound), 100 metres in diameter. Inspiration for the Memorial came from &quot;the ancient burial mounds of our ancestors &lt;U+2026&gt; that recollects monuments like <a href="Silbury_Hill" title="wikilink">Silbury Hill</a> and the mounds around <a href="Stonehenge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stonehenge</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The mound is surmounted by a <a href="Portland_stone" title="wikilink">Portland stone</a> circle, with openings to the east and west and an <a href="obelisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">obelisk</a> at the eastern end. Within the circle are two straight stone walls, with bronze sculptures at their centres. The names of the 16,000 service personnel are carved into the Memorial's stone walls, with space for an additional 15,000 names to be added. The names of all those <a href="killed_in_action" title="wikilink">killed in combat</a>, in training, on <a href="peacekeeping" class="uri" title="wikilink">peacekeeping</a> operations and on exercise are included. It includes the dead from operations in <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>, <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>, <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>, the <a href="Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands</a>, <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>, <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>The bronze sculptures are the work of <a href="Ian_Rank-Broadley" title="wikilink">Ian Rank-Broadley</a>. The Stretcher Bearers sculpture shows a wounded serviceman borne by comrades, watched by grieving family. It represents the cost of armed conflict on those left behind. The Gates sculpture group shows the body of a fallen serviceman taken into the arms of his comrades, and a figure pointing through the Great Gates of Eternity to Paradise. The structure is aligned so that at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, the sun's rays will stream through the gap to illuminate the centre of the Memorial.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>The Memorial is located on a  site at the <a href="National_Memorial_Arboretum" title="wikilink">National Memorial Arboretum</a>, at <a href="Alrewas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alrewas</a> near <a href="Lichfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lichfield</a> in <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>, which opened in 2001, where there are already a number of Service-related memorials. A central location in the UK, outside London, was chosen deliberately to ensure that the memorial was accessible to all communities in the UK.</p>
