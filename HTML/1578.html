The date on the title page of 1804 for <em>Milton</em> is probably when the plates were begun but the poem was printed c. 1808.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Today it is best known as the <a href="hymn" class="uri" title="wikilink">hymn</a> &quot;<strong>Jerusalem</strong>&quot;, with music written by Sir <a href="Hubert_Parry" title="wikilink">Hubert Parry</a> in 1916.</p>
<p>The poem was inspired by the <a href="apocryphal" class="uri" title="wikilink">apocryphal</a> story that a young <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>, accompanied by his uncle <a href="Joseph_of_Arimathea" title="wikilink">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, travelled to the area that is now England and visited <a href="Glastonbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glastonbury</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The legend is linked to an idea in the <a href="Book_of_Revelation" title="wikilink">Book of Revelation</a> (3:12 and 21:2) describing a <a href="Second_Coming" title="wikilink">Second Coming</a>, wherein Jesus establishes a new <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> church in general, and the <a href="English_Church" title="wikilink">English Church</a> in particular, used Jerusalem as a metaphor for <a href="Heaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heaven</a>, a place of universal love and peace. The poem implies that the visit of Jesus briefly created a heaven in England, in contrast to its post-<a href="Industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">industrial-revolution</a> &quot;dark Satanic Mills.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>
<p>Blake refers to the legend by asking questions rather than stating it to be true. He says that there may, or may not, have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England. But that was then; now, he says, we are faced with the challenge of creating such a country once again.</p>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<p>The original text is found on the preface Blake printed for inclusion with <em>Milton, a Poem</em>, following the lines beginning &quot;The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer &amp; Ovid: of Plato &amp; Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ...&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><code> And did those feet in ancient time.</code></p>
<p>Walk upon Englands mountains green: And was the holy Lamb of God, On Englands pleasant pastures seen!</p>
<p>And did the Countenance Divine, Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalem builded here, Among these dark Satanic Mills?</p>
<p>Bring me my Bow of burning gold; Bring me my Arrows of desire: Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold! Bring me my Chariot of fire!</p>

<h3 id="satanic-mills"><em>Satanic Mills</em></h3>
<p>The term &quot;dark <a href="Satan" title="wikilink">Satanic</a> Mills&quot;, which entered the <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English language</a> from this poem, is interpreted as referring to the early <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a> and its destruction of nature and human relationships.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This view has been linked to the fate of the Albion Flour Mills, which was the first major factory in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, built in 1769 by <a href="Matthew_Boulton" title="wikilink">Matthew Boulton</a> and <a href="James_Watt_(inventor)" title="wikilink">James Watt</a>. It was powered by Watt's <a href="steam_engine" title="wikilink">steam engines</a>, and produced 6,000 bushels of flour a week. The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed, perhaps deliberately, by fire in 1791. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, &quot;Success to the mills of ALBION but no Albion Mills.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Opponents referred to the factory as satanic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. An illustration of the fire published at the time shows a <a href="devil" class="uri" title="wikilink">devil</a> squatting on the building.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.</p>
<p>The phrase was especially poignant for the millions of workers employed in mills, who adopted the poem as a <a href="Socialist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socialist</a> hymn.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Bishop of Durham, <a href="N._T._Wright" title="wikilink">N. T. Wright</a>, speaking in a <a href="homily" class="uri" title="wikilink">homily</a> given before the singing of the hymn, proposed the view that the &quot;dark satanic mills&quot; refers to the &quot;great churches&quot;. The incongruity of this could be seen as &quot;a dangerously subversive act&quot;, Wright said, or by likening it to when &quot;an old unreconstructed <a href="Marxist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marxist</a> <a href="trade_union" title="wikilink">trade unionist</a> is given a <a href="peerage" class="uri" title="wikilink">peerage</a> and ends his days muttering his imprecations against The System from a somnolent posture on the back benches of the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Blake's phrase resonates with a wider theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually repressive ideology based on a quantifiable reality. Blake saw the <a href="cotton_mill" title="wikilink">cotton mills</a> and <a href="collieries" class="uri" title="wikilink">collieries</a> of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>
<p>Another contested view is that the Mills refer to churches of the established <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A similar approach sees the Satanic Mills as the universities of <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>, which as the traditional seats of learning and thought in England, were heavily controlled by the <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> church at the time.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Satanic_mills.jpg" title="fig:The first reference to Satan&#39;s &quot;Mills&quot;, next to images of megaliths" alt="The first reference to Satan&#39;s &quot;Mills&quot;, next to images of megaliths" width="300" />An alternative theory is that Blake refers to <a href="Stonehenge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stonehenge</a>; an illustration of it and other <a href="megalith" title="wikilink">megaliths</a> is featured in his work, <em>Milton</em>. However, he did not see ancient Britain as satanic, but rather saw the <a href="Druids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Druids</a> and their supposed temple, Stonehenge, as precursors of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Satan's &quot;Mills&quot; are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither <a href="industrialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">industrialism</a> nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: &quot;the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of <a href="El_Shaddai" title="wikilink">Shaddai</a> / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chariot-of-fire"><em>Chariot of fire</em></h3>
<p>The line from the poem, &quot;Bring me my Chariot of fire!&quot; draws on the story of <a href="wikisource:Bible_(King_James)/2_Kings#2:11" title="wikilink">2 Kings 2:11</a>, where the <a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a> prophet <a href="Elijah_(prophet)" title="wikilink">Elijah</a> is taken directly to heaven: &quot;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="green-and-pleasant-land"><em>Green and pleasant Land</em></h3>
<p>Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of <em>Milton</em> when he was living in the village of <a href="Felpham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Felpham</a> in <a href="Sussex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sussex</a>. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's &quot;evident pleasure&quot; in the Felpham countryside.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="revolution">Revolution</h3>
<p>Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: &quot;As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)&quot;. He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> mystical <a href="allegory" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegory</a>. Even though the poem was written during the <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Blake was an outspoken supporter of the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, whose successor <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a> claimed to be. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. (In 1803 Blake was charged at <a href="Chichester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chichester</a> with high treason for having 'uttered seditious and treasonable expressions' but was acquitted<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>.) The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from <a href="Book_of_Numbers" title="wikilink">Numbers</a> ch. 11, v. 29: &quot;Would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets.&quot; Christopher Rowland, a Professor of Theology at <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a>, has argued that this includes &quot;everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an honest persuasion that with personal struggle, things could be improved.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The words of the poem &quot;stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society in England's green and pleasant land&quot;.</p>

<p></poem> The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing, was included in a patriotic anthology of verse published in 1916, a time when morale had begun to decline due to the high number of casualties in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and the perception that there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the poem came to symbolise what England was fighting for. Therefore, <a href="Robert_Bridges" title="wikilink">Robert Bridges</a>, the <a href="Poet_Laureate" title="wikilink">Poet Laureate</a>, asked Sir Hubert Parry to put it to music at a Fight for Right campaign meeting in London's <a href="Queen&#39;s_Hall" title="wikilink">Queen's Hall</a>. The aims of this organisation were &quot;to brace the spirit of the nation that the people of Great Britain, knowing that they are fighting for the best interests of humanity, may refuse any temptation, however insidious, to conclude a premature peace, and may accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Bridges asked Parry to supply the verse with &quot;suitable, simple music that an audience could take up and join in&quot;. The <a href="sheet_music" title="wikilink">score</a> was conducted by Parry's student <a href="Walford_Davies" title="wikilink">Walford Davies</a>; Parry afterward released it to him, saying &quot;There you are, my boy, do what you like with it.&quot; Davies had it published by <a href="Curwen_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Curwen</a> and began teaching the tune.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Originally Parry intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice, but this is rare in contemporary performances. The most famous version was <a href="orchestration" title="wikilink">orchestrated</a> by Sir <a href="Edward_Elgar" title="wikilink">Edward Elgar</a> in 1922 for a large orchestra at the <a href="Leeds_Festival" title="wikilink">Leeds Festival</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Upon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George V</a> said that he preferred &quot;Jerusalem&quot; over &quot;<a href="God_Save_the_King" title="wikilink">God Save the King</a>&quot;, the National Anthem.</p>
<p><em>Jerusalem</em> is considered to be <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>'s most popular <a href="patriotism" title="wikilink">patriotic</a> song; <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> has called it &quot;Fast becoming an <a href="Proposed_English_National_Anthems" title="wikilink">alternative national anthem</a>,&quot; <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and there have even been calls to give it official status.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> England has no official anthem and so uses the British National Anthem &quot;<a href="God_Save_the_Queen" title="wikilink">God Save the Queen</a>&quot; for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including <a href="cricket_(sport)" title="wikilink">cricket</a>, <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a>, and <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a> use &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as the English anthem. Questions in <a href="British_Parliament" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that each sport must make its own decision. Critics of the song have said that its reference to a foreign city and its non-<a href="secular" class="uri" title="wikilink">secular</a> basis make it unsuitable.</p>
<p>The poem's idealistic <a href="Theme_(literature)" title="wikilink">theme</a> or <a href="subtext" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtext</a> accounts for its popularity across the philosophical spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="wikilink">1945 general election</a>; <a href="Clement_Attlee" title="wikilink">Clement Attlee</a> said they would build &quot;a new Jerusalem&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>. It has been sung at conferences of the British <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a>, at the <a href="Glee_Club_(British_politics)" title="wikilink">Glee Club</a> of the British <a href="Liberal_Assembly" title="wikilink">Liberal Assembly</a>, the British Labour Party and by the British <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p>
<p>It is frequently sung as an office or recessional hymn in English cathedrals, churches and chapels on <a href="St_George&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">St George's Day</a>. The hymn is also sung in some churches on Jerusalem Sunday, a day set aside to celebrate the holy city, in <a href="Anglican_Communion" title="wikilink">Anglican Churches</a> throughout the world and even in some <a href="Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Episcopal Churches</a> in the U.S. However some vicars in the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, according to the <a href="BBC_TV" title="wikilink">BBC TV</a> programme &quot;Jerusalem: An Anthem for England&quot;, have said that the song is not technically a <a href="hymn" class="uri" title="wikilink">hymn</a>, as it is not a prayer to God (which hymns always are). Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Parry's tune is so well liked that the song is not only sung in many schools, especially <a href="Public_school_(UK)" title="wikilink">public schools</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> (it was used as the title music for the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>'s 1979 series 'Public School' at <a href="Radley_College" title="wikilink">Radley College</a>) , but also at several private schools in <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words. The established <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a> debated altering the words of the hymn to read &quot;<a href="Albion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albion</a>&quot; instead of England to make it more locally relevant.</p>
<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>
<p>The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently only its most notable live performances are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is sung every year by an audience of thousands at the end of the <a href="The_Proms#Last_Night_of_the_Proms" title="wikilink">Last Night of the Proms</a> in the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a> and simultaneously in the <em>Proms in the Park</em> venues throughout the country.</li>

During the 1920s, many <a href="Women&#39;s_Institutes" title="wikilink">Women's Institutes</a> started closing meetings by singing it, and this caught on nationally. Although it has never actually been adopted as the WI's official anthem, in practice it holds that position and is an enduring element of the public image of the WI.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>

<li>It is traditionally sung before <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a>'s <a href="Challenge_Cup" title="wikilink">Challenge Cup</a> Final, along with &quot;<a href="Abide_with_Me" title="wikilink">Abide with Me</a>&quot;.</li>

<li>Since 2004, it has been the anthem of the <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> team and is regularly sung by <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a> crowds.</li>

<p>Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody.
