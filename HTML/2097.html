<p><strong>Stephen</strong> (<a href="circa" title="wikilink">c.</a> 1092/6Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 25 October 1154), often referred to as <strong>Stephen of Blois</strong> (, Medieval French: <em>Estienne de Blois</em>), was a grandson of <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a>. He was <a href="King_of_England" title="wikilink">King of England</a> from 1135 to his death, and also the <a href="Count_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Count of Boulogne</a> by right of his wife. Stephen's reign was marked by <a href="the_Anarchy" title="wikilink">the Anarchy</a>, a civil war with his cousin and rival, the <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a>. He was succeeded by Matilda's son, <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a>, the first of the <a href="House_of_Plantagenet" title="wikilink">Angevin</a> kings.</p>
<p>Stephen was born in the <a href="County_of_Blois" title="wikilink">County of Blois</a> in middle <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>; his father, Count <a href="Stephen_II,_Count_of_Blois" title="wikilink">Stephen-Henry</a>, died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother, <a href="Adela_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Adela</a>. Placed into the court of his uncle, <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a>, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands. Stephen married <a href="Matilda_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Matilda of Boulogne</a>, inheriting additional estates in <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> and <a href="Boulogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boulogne</a> that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I's son, <a href="William_Adelin" title="wikilink">William Adelin</a>, in the sinking of the <em><a href="White_Ship" title="wikilink">White Ship</a></em> in 1120; William's death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge. When Henry I died in 1135, Stephen quickly crossed the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> and with the help of his brother <a href="Henry_of_Blois" title="wikilink">Henry of Blois</a>, a powerful ecclesiastic, took the throne, arguing that the preservation of order across the kingdom took priority over his earlier oaths to support the claim of Henry I's daughter, the <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a>.</p>
<p>The early years of Stephen's reign were largely successful, despite a series of attacks on his possessions in England and Normandy from <a href="David_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">David I of Scotland</a>, Welsh rebels and the Empress Matilda's husband, <a href="Geoffrey_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Geoffrey of Anjou</a>. In 1138 the Empress's half-brother <a href="Robert,_1st_Earl_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Robert of Gloucester</a> rebelled against Stephen, threatening civil war. Together with his close advisor, <a href="Waleran_de_Beaumont,_1st_Earl_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Waleron de Beaumont</a>, Stephen took firm steps to defend England, including arresting a powerful family of bishops. When the Empress and Robert invaded in 1139, however, Stephen was unable to rapidly crush the revolt, which took hold in the south-west of England. Captured at the <a href="Battle_of_Lincoln_(1141)" title="wikilink">battle of Lincoln</a> in 1141, Stephen was abandoned by many of his followers and lost control of <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>. Stephen was only freed after his wife and <a href="William_of_Ypres" title="wikilink">William of Ypres</a>, one of his military commanders, captured Robert at the <a href="rout_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">rout of Winchester</a>, but the war dragged on for many years with neither side able to win an advantage.</p>
<p>Stephen became increasingly concerned with ensuring that his son, <a href="Eustace_IV,_Count_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Eustace</a>, would inherit his throne after him. The king attempted to convince the church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim: Pope <a href="Pope_Eugene_III" title="wikilink">Eugene III</a> refused and Stephen found himself in a sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry FitzEmpress</a>, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at <a href="Wallingford_Castle" title="wikilink">Wallingford</a> but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began to examine a negotiated peace, a process hastened by the sudden death of Eustace. Stephen and Henry agreed the <a href="Treaty_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">Treaty of Winchester</a> later in the year, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over <a href="William_I,_Count_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">William</a>, Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which Stephen's personality, external events or the weaknesses in the Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war.</p>

<p>France in the 12th century was a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal control of the king of France.

Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother <a href="William_Rufus" title="wikilink">William Rufus</a>. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, <a href="Robert_Curthose" title="wikilink">Robert Curthose</a>, defeating Robert's army at the <a href="battle_of_Tinchebray" title="wikilink">battle of Tinchebray</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Henry then found himself in conflict with <a href="Louis_VI_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VI</a> of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son <a href="William_Clito" title="wikilink">William Clito</a> the Duke of Normandy.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Henry responded by forming a net of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Adela and Theobald allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by <a href="Robert_of_Bell&lt;U+00EA&gt;me,_3rd_Earl_of_Shrewsbury" title="wikilink">Robert of Bell&lt;U+00EA&gt;me</a> were opposing his rule. Stephen was probably with Henry during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the king, and was definitely present at court during the king's visit to the <a href="Abbey_of_Saint-Evroul" title="wikilink">Abbey of Saint-Evroul</a> in 1113.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost certainly as part of Henry's court.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Henry became a powerful patron to Stephen; Henry probably chose to support him because Stephen was part of his extended family and a regional ally, yet not sufficiently wealthy or powerful in his own right to represent a threat to either the king or his heir, <a href="William_Adelin" title="wikilink">William Adelin</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the king to progress in life.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William, the <a href="Count_of_Mortain" title="wikilink">Count of Mortain</a>, and the <a href="Honour_of_Eye" title="wikilink">Honour of Eye</a>, a large lordship previously owned by <a href="Robert_Malet" title="wikilink">Robert Malet</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The gift of the <a href="Honour_of_Lancaster" title="wikilink">Honour of Lancaster</a> also followed after it was confiscated by Henry from <a href="Roger_the_Poitevin" title="wikilink">Roger the Poitevin</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Stephen was also given lands in <a href="Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on</a> in southern Normandy by Henry, but the local Normans rebelled, seeking assistance from <a href="Fulk_IV,_Count_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Fulk</a>, the Count of Anjou.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Stephen and his older brother Theobald were comprehensively beaten in the subsequent campaign, which culminated in the <a href="battle_of_Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on" title="wikilink">battle of Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on</a>, and the territories were not recovered.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, the king arranged for Stephen to marry <a href="Matilda_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Matilda</a> in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the <a href="Count_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Count of Boulogne</a>, who owned both the important continental port of <a href="Boulogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boulogne</a> and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed likely to become the <a href="Count_of_Flanders" title="wikilink">Count of Flanders</a>; Stephen was sent by the king on a mission to prevent this, and in the aftermath of his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Eventually a truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="WhiteShipSinking.jpg" title="fig:An early 14th-century depiction of the White Ship sinking in 1120" alt="An early 14th-century depiction of the White Ship sinking in 1120" /> In 1120, the English political landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the <em><a href="White_Ship" title="wikilink">White Ship</a></em> to travel from <a href="Barfleur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barfleur</a> in Normandy to England, including the heir to the throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from <a href="diarrhoea" class="uri" title="wikilink">diarrhoea</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Contemporary chroniclers varied in their explanation for Stephen's absence from the <em>White Ship</em>, <a href="Orderic_Vitalis" title="wikilink">Orderic</a> gives his illness as the reason.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|There has been extensive speculation as to the cause of the sinking of the <em>White Ship</em>.

<p>With Adelin dead, the inheritance to the English throne was thrown into doubt. Rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, male <a href="primogeniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">primogeniture</a>, in which the eldest child would inherit a title, was becoming more popular.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor whilst he himself was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear, but this was not the case in England. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands&lt;U+2014&gt;usually considered to be the most valuable&lt;U+2014&gt;and younger sons being given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> had gained England by force, <a href="William_Rufus" title="wikilink">William Rufus</a> and <a href="Robert_Curthose" title="wikilink">Robert Curthose</a> had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>With William Adelin dead, Henry had only one other legitimate child, <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Matilda</a>, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Despite Henry taking a second wife, Queen <a href="Adeliza_of_Louvain" title="wikilink">Adeliza</a>, it became increasingly unlikely that Henry would have another legitimate son and instead he looked to Matilda as his intended heir.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Matilda had been married to <a href="Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Henry V</a>, the Holy Roman Emperor, which gave her the title of Empress, but her husband died in 1125 and she was remarried in 1128 to <a href="Geoffrey_Plantagenet,_Count_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Geoffrey</a>, the <a href="Count_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Count of Anjou</a>, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an <a href="Angevins" title="wikilink">Angevin</a> ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry's domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the king's personality and reputation.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Henry attempted to build up a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take <a href="oath" title="wikilink">oaths</a> first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful ruler after her.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda and Geoffrey became increasingly strained towards the end of the king's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the king should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near <a href="Lyon" title="wikilink">Lyons</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="StepanAngl.jpg" title="fig:A 13th century depiction of the coronation of Stephen, by Matthew Paris" alt="A 13th century depiction of the coronation of Stephen, by Matthew Paris" /> Stephen was a well established figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; he was also considered a man capable of firm action.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He was very pious, both in terms of his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Stephen also had a personal <a href="Augustinians" title="wikilink">Augustine</a> confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a <a href="Penance" title="wikilink">penitential regime</a> for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of <a href="Cistercians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cistercians</a> to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Rumours of his father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, continued to circulate, and a desire to avoid the same reputation may have influenced some of Stephen's rasher military actions.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> His wife, Matilda, played a major role in running their vast English estates, which contributed to the couple being the second-richest lay household in the country after the king.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The landless Flemish nobleman <a href="William_of_Ypres" title="wikilink">William of Ypres</a> had joined Stephen's household in 1133, alongside <a href="Faramus_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">Faramus of Boulogne</a>, a Flemish relative and friend of Matilda's.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stephen's younger brother Henry of Blois had also risen to power under Henry I.

Historian <a href="David_Crouch_(historian)" title="wikilink">David Crouch</a> suggests that Stephen effectively &quot;bowed out of Wales&quot; around this time to concentrate on his other problems.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Meanwhile, Stephen had put down two revolts in the south-west led by <a href="Baldwin_de_Redvers" title="wikilink">Baldwin de Redvers</a> and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became an increasingly vocal critic of the king.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>The security of Normandy was also a concern.

<p>Stephen's relationship with the church became gradually more complex. The royal charter of 1136 had promised to review the ownership of all the lands that had been taken by the crown from the church since 1087, but these estates were now typically owned by nobles.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Henry of Blois's claims, in his role as Abbot of Glastonbury, to extensive lands in Devon resulted in considerable local unrest.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> In 1136, Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="William_de_Corbeil" title="wikilink">William de Corbeil</a> died.

<p>Stephen's first few years as king can be interpreted in different ways.

The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court, and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

Stephen was heavily influenced by his principal advisor, <a href="Waleran_de_Beaumont,_1st_Earl_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Waleran de Beaumont</a>, the twin brother of <a href="Robert_de_Beaumont,_2nd_Earl_of_Leicester" title="wikilink">Robert of Leicester</a>.

<p>Stephen took steps to remove a group of bishops he regarded as a threat to his rule. The royal administration under Henry I had been headed by <a href="Roger_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Roger</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, supported by Roger's nephews, <a href="Alexander_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Alexander</a> and <a href="Nigel_(Bishop_of_Ely)" title="wikilink">Nigel</a>, the Bishops of <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Bishop_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Ely</a> respectively, and Roger's son, <a href="Roger_le_Poer" title="wikilink">Roger le Poer</a>, who was the <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> These bishops were powerful landowners as well as ecclesiastical rulers, and they had begun to build new castles and increase the size of their military forces, leading Stephen to suspect that they were about to defect to the Empress Matilda. Roger and his family were also enemies of Waleran, who disliked their control of the royal administration. In June 1139, Stephen held his court in Oxford, where a fight between <a href="Alan,_1st_Earl_of_Richmond" title="wikilink">Alan of Britanny</a> and Roger's men broke out, an incident probably deliberately created by Stephen.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Stephen responded by demanding that Roger and the other bishops surrender all of their castles in England. This threat was backed up by the arrest of the bishops, with the exception of Nigel who had taken refuge in <a href="Devizes_Castle" title="wikilink">Devizes Castle</a>; the bishop only surrendered after Stephen besieged the castle and threatened to execute Roger le Poer.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> The remaining castles were then surrendered to the king.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The impact of these arrests on the efficacy of the subsequent royal administration and the loyalty of the wider English church has been much discussed.

<p>Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, was alarmed by this, both as a matter of principle, since Stephen had previously agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> As the papal legate, he summoned the king to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property.

The king was supported by <a href="Hugh_of_Amiens" title="wikilink">Hugh</a>, <a href="Archbishop_of_Rouen" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Rouen</a>, who challenged the bishops to show how <a href="canon_law" title="wikilink">canon law</a> entitled them to build or hold castles.

<p>Stephen then agreed to a truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The reasoning behind Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear.

<p>Over the summer, Stephen intensified the long-running siege of <a href="Wallingford_Castle" title="wikilink">Wallingford Castle</a> in a final attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold.<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south in an attempt to relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a> Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a> at Wallingford in July.<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a> By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a> As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church <a href="Treaty_of_Wallingford" title="wikilink">brokered a truce</a>, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a></p>
<p>In the aftermath of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a> Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen had already begun to consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a></p>
<p>Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="Stamford,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Stamford</a> to Henry while the king was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but <a href="Nottingham_Castle" title="wikilink">Nottingham Castle</a> survived an Angevin attempt to capture it.<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> Meanwhile, Stephen's brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified in an effort to broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311"><sup>311</sup></a> Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress's armies met again at Winchester, where the two leaders would ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a> Stephen announced the <a href="Treaty_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">Treaty of Winchester</a> in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing <a href="homage" class="uri" title="wikilink">homage</a> to him; Stephen promised to listen to Henry's advice, but retained all his royal powers; Stephen's remaining son, <a href="William_I,_Count_of_Boulogne" title="wikilink">William</a>, would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; key royal castles would be held on Henry's behalf by guarantors whilst Stephen would have access to Henry's castles; and the numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a <a href="kiss_of_peace" title="wikilink">kiss of peace</a> in the cathedral.<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a></p>

<p>Stephen's decision to recognise Henry as his heir was, at the time, not necessarily a final solution to the civil war.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> Despite the issuing of new currency and administrative reforms, Stephen might potentially have lived for many more years, whilst Henry's position on the continent was far from secure.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> Although Stephen's son William was young and unprepared to challenge Henry for the throne in 1153, the situation could well have shifted in subsequent years&lt;U+2014&gt;there were widespread rumours during 1154 that William planned to assassinate Henry, for example.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> Historian Graham White describes the treaty of Winchester as a &quot;precarious peace&quot;, capturing the judgement of most modern historians that the situation in late 1153 was still uncertain and unpredictable.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<p>Certainly many problems remained to be resolved, including re-establishing royal authority over the provinces and resolving the complex issue of which barons should control the contested lands and estates after the long civil war.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> Stephen burst into activity in early 1154, travelling around the kingdom extensively.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> He began issuing royal <a href="writ" title="wikilink">writs</a> for the south-west of England once again and travelled to <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a> where he held a major court in an attempt to impress upon the northern barons that royal authority was being reasserted.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> After a busy summer in 1154, however, Stephen travelled to <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a> to meet the <a href="Thierry,_Count_of_Flanders" title="wikilink">Count of Flanders</a>; some historians believe that the king was already ill and preparing to settle his family affairs.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> Stephen fell ill with a <a href="Stomach_disease" title="wikilink">stomach disorder</a> and died on 25 October at the <a href="Dover_Priory" title="wikilink">local priory</a>, being buried at Faversham Abbey with his wife Matilda and son Eustace.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<p>After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to the throne of England.
