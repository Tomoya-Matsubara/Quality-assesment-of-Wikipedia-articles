<h2 id="selection-process">Selection process</h2>
<p>The championship teams of six conferences were granted automatic tournament berths. Five of those were based upon the results of conference tournaments. The <a href="ECAC_Lacrosse_League" title="wikilink">Eastern College Athletic Conference</a> (ECAC) did not hold a conference tournament and granted its automatic qualifier to regular season champions <a href="Denver_Pioneers" title="wikilink">Denver</a>.

<p>The selection committee granted the other ten tournament teams at-large berths. All four <a href="Atlantic_Coast_Conference" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) teams received at-large bids for the fourth straight year: <a href="Virginia_Cavaliers_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, <a href="Maryland_Terrapins_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>, <a href="North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Duke_Blue_Devils_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Duke</a>. Two berths were filled by the <a href="Big_East_Conference" title="wikilink">Big East Conference</a>: <a href="Syracuse_Orange_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a> and <a href="Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a>.

<p>Notable teams considered to be &quot;on the bubble&quot; for selection, but not chosen, included <a href="Georgetown_Hoyas" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a> and <a href="Villanova_Wildcats_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Villanova</a> of the Big East, <a href="Yale_Bulldogs" title="wikilink">Yale</a> and <a href="Brown_Bears_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">Brown</a> of the Ivy League, and <a href="Drexel_Dragons" title="wikilink">Drexel</a> and <a href="UMass_Minutemen_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">UMass</a> of the CAA.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The selection of some at-large teams such as Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins instead of Georgetown, which missed the tournament for the third straight season, was considered a questionable snub by some analysts.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="first-round">First round</h3>
<p>The biggest surprise of the first round was Army's double-overtime upset of No. 2 seed Syracuse at the <a href="Carrier_Dome" title="wikilink">Carrier Dome</a>. Some analysts ranked it among the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was Army's first tournament win since <a href="1993_NCAA_Division_I_Men&#39;s_Lacrosse_Championship" title="wikilink">1993</a> and just the second home playoff loss for Syracuse since the tournament's inception; the other occurred in the <a href="1991_NCAA_Division_I_Men&#39;s_Lacrosse_Championship" title="wikilink">1991</a> semifinals.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="quarterfinals">Quarterfinals</h3>
<p>Notre Dame pulled off a second straight upset over No. 3 Maryland 7-5 after ousting No. 6 Princeton in the first round. The Irish qualified for the semifinals for only the second time in school history. Their only other appearance came in 2001.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Duke ran away with a 17-9 win over rival North Carolina after a 6-goal spurt in the second half. It marks the fourth consecutive semifinal appearance for the Blue Devils and third NCAA quarterfinal victory over North Carolina in the last four years.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Cornell quickly put an end to Army's hopes of another upset, racing out to a 4-0 lead in an eventual 14-5 victory. With the victory, the Big Red advanced to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="semifinals">Semifinals</h3>
<h4 id="notre-dame-vs.-cornell">Notre Dame vs. Cornell</h4>

<p>In the first semifinal, Notre Dame once again used its stifling defense led by goalie Scott Rodgers to beat a third straight seeded opponent in No. 7 Cornell. The Irish led 6-3 at half time but two straight goals in the third quarter pulled Cornell to within two at 7-5. It was as close as the Big Red would get, however, as the Irish finished with a flurry to win 12-7. The win marked the first time that an unseeded team had reached the championship game since <a href="UMass_Minutemen_men&#39;s_lacrosse" title="wikilink">UMass</a> in 2006. It also marked the first time in school history that Notre Dame advanced to the title game.</p>
<h4 id="duke-vs.-virginia">Duke vs. Virginia</h4>

<p>In the second semifinal, No. 5 Duke upset No. 1 Virginia. After leading 7-5 at halftime, Virginia scored first in the second half to take an 8-5 lead, but Duke responded with a seven-goal blitz that made it 12-8 in favor of the Blue Devils early in the fourth quarter. Virginia would not go quietly, however, as the Cavaliers tied the game at 13 with just over a minute to play. With just 12 seconds left, Duke scored with the familiar combination of Ned Crotty to Max Quinzani to send Duke to its third championship game in six years.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="championship">Championship</h3>
<h4 id="notre-dame-vs.-duke">Notre Dame vs. Duke</h4>

<p>The championship game featured two schools who had never won a national title before, the first time that had happened since <a href="1973_NCAA_Division_I_Men&#39;s_Lacrosse_Championship" title="wikilink">1973</a>. This guaranteed that a first-time Division I lacrosse champion would be crowned, something that had not happened since Princeton in <a href="1992_NCAA_Division_I_Men&#39;s_Lacrosse_Championship" title="wikilink">1992</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The game proved to be one of the closest championship contests ever, albeit the lowest scoring one as well. Neither team ever led by more than a single goal throughout the contest. After trailing 3-2 at halftime, Notre Dame took its first lead since the first minute of the game early in the fourth quarter. Duke tied the game a few minutes later, though, and had a chance to win in the final seconds of regulation, but stellar defense by Notre Dame and timely saves by tournament MVP Scott Rodgers sent the game to overtime. The slow pace of regulation did not continue into overtime, as Duke Sophomore CJ Costabile, a long stick midfielder, won the opening faceoff cleanly and sprinted straight downfield to score just 5 seconds into the extra period. The goal set the record for the fastest to start an overtime in NCAA championship history, and gave Duke its first national title in school history.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="post-tournament-honors">Post-tournament honors</h2>
<p>After the championship, Duke attackman Ned Crotty was honored with the <a href="Tewaaraton_Trophy" title="wikilink">Tewaaraton Trophy</a> for the most outstanding Division I men's lacrosse player.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The NCAA announced the All-Tournament team after the championship. Scott Rodgers, goalie for runner-up Notre Dame, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. The full team included four players from champion Duke, three from runner-up Notre Dame, two from semifinalist Virginia, and one from semifinalist Cornell. The following individuals were named to that team:<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
