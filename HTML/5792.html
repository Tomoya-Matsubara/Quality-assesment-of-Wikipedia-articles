<p><strong>Nikephoros</strong> (), also <a href="Latinisation_(literature)" title="wikilink">latinized</a> as <strong>Nicephorus</strong> or <strong>Nicephoros</strong>, was the second son of the <a href="Byzantine_emperor" title="wikilink">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Constantine_V" title="wikilink">Constantine V</a> (<a href="reign" title="wikilink">reigned</a> 741&lt;U+2013&gt;775) and <em><a href="Caesar_(title)" title="wikilink">Caesar</a></em> of the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>. He was engaged in a plot against his half-brother, <a href="Leo_IV_the_Khazar" title="wikilink">Leo IV</a> (r. 775&lt;U+2013&gt;780), which cost Nikephoros his title, and was the focal point of numerous usurpation plots during the subsequent reigns of his nephew, <a href="Constantine_VI" title="wikilink">Constantine VI</a> (r. 780&lt;U+2013&gt;797), and of Constantine's mother, <a href="Irene_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Irene of Athens</a> (r. 797&lt;U+2013&gt;802). He was therefore <a href="political_mutilation_in_Byzantine_culture" title="wikilink">blinded</a> and exiled to a monastery for most of his life, probably dying in the island of <a href="Av&lt;U+015F&gt;a" title="wikilink">Aphousia</a> sometime after 812.</p>

<p><img src="Leo_iv_constantine_vi_coin.jpg" title="fig:Gold solidus of Leo IV, depicting Constantine VI as well" alt="Gold solidus of Leo IV, depicting Constantine VI as well" width="250" /> Nikephoros was born in the late 750s (<a href="circa" class="uri" title="wikilink">circa</a> (ca.) 756/758) to Constantine V and his third wife <a href="Eudokia,_wife_of_Constantine_V" title="wikilink">Eudokia</a>. Nikephoros was Constantine's third son overall, following Leo IV, who was born 750 to Constantine's first wife <a href="Tzitzak" title="wikilink">Irene of Khazaria</a>, and Christopher, who was born circa 755 to Eudokia. Either Christopher or Nikephoros were possibly twin brothers to Eudokia and Constantine's only daughter, Anthousa.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> On 1 April 769, Eudokia was crowned as <em><a href="Augusta_(honorific)" title="wikilink">Augusta</a></em>, and on the same occasion Christopher and Nikephoros were crowned and raised to the rank of <em>Caesar</em>, while their younger brother Niketas was made <em><a href="Nobilissimus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nobilissimus</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nikephoros had two other younger brothers, Anthimos and Eudokimos, who were named <em>Nobilissimi</em> at later dates.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>When Constantine V died in 775, his eldest son ascended the throne as Leo IV. Soon, Leo confiscated a large amount of gold reserved for the use of his half-brothers, and distributed it to the army and the citizens of <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> as a <a href="donative" class="uri" title="wikilink">donative</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Then, in spring 776, a conspiracy headed by Nikephoros and involving a number of middle-ranking courtiers was discovered. Nikephoros himself was stripped of his rank, but otherwise not harmed, while the other plotters were <a href="tonsure" title="wikilink">tonsured</a> as monks and exiled to <a href="Cherson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherson</a> in the <a href="Crimea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimea</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When Leo IV died in October 780, his sole heir was the young Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene. Due to his age, a regency was instituted under Irene, but this was not well-received among leading officials. Not only was she a woman, and hence alien to the military-dominated establishment of the time, but also a confirmed <a href="iconophile" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconophile</a>, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as <a href="heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">heresy</a> by the state-sponsored doctrine of <a href="Byzantine_Iconoclasm" title="wikilink">iconoclasm</a>, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A number of them, including the <a href="logothetes_tou_dromou" title="wikilink">Postal Logothete</a> (foreign minister) Gregory, the former <em><a href="strategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategos</a></em> (governor) of the <a href="Anatolic_Theme" title="wikilink">Anatolic Theme</a> Bardas and Constantine, the <a href="domestikos" title="wikilink">Domestic</a> (commander) of the <a href="Excubitors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Excubitors</a> guard regiment, favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely a month and a half after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, while Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession. To confirm this before the people, on Christmas Day 780, Nikephoros and his brothers were were forced to perform the communion service in the <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In 792, the return of Irene to power (after having been ousted in a military revolt in 790), coupled with the disastrous defeat of Constantine VI at <a href="Battle_of_Marcellae" title="wikilink">Marcellae</a> against the <a href="First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Bulgars</a>, caused widespread discontent among the troops. Some of the imperial guard regiments, the <em><a href="tagma_(military)" title="wikilink">tagmata</a></em>, proclaimed Nikephoros as emperor, but Constantine reacted swiftly: he arrested his uncles, and while Nikephoros was blinded, the others had their tongues slit. They were then imprisoned at the monastery of <a href="Tarabya" title="wikilink">Therapia</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="after-792">After 792</h2>
<p><img src="Solidus-Irene-sb1599.jpg" title="fig:Gold solidus of Irene during her sole reign (797&lt;U+2013&gt;802)" alt="Gold solidus of Irene during her sole reign (797&lt;U+2013&gt;802)" width="250" /> Nikephoros is no longer mentioned by name after 792; instead, the brothers are mentioned collectively. It is therefore questionable whether he is to be included in subsequent events, although traditionally (including in reference works like the <em><a href="Oxford_Dictionary_of_Byzantium" title="wikilink">Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium</a></em>) it is held that he did share in his brothers' fate and died after 812.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After Irene deposed Constantine VI in 797, the brothers were visited at the monastery by some of their supporters and persuaded to seek refuge in the Hagia Sophia. If it had been hoped that the city's populace would be moved to proclaim one of them emperor, their hopes were dashed. No uprising in their support materialized, and Irene's trusted eunuch advisor <a href="Aetios_(eunuch)" title="wikilink">Aetios</a> managed to extricate the brothers and send them to exile in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At Athens, they were again the subject of a conspiracy in March 799, when a certain <a href="Akameros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akameros</a>, &quot;<em><a href="archon" class="uri" title="wikilink">archon</a></em> of the Slavs in Belzetia&quot; in southern <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a>, together with local troops from the <a href="thema" title="wikilink">theme</a> of <a href="Hellas_(theme)" title="wikilink">Hellas</a> (to which Athens belonged), planned to proclaim one of them emperor. The plot was foiled, but they were moved to the island of Panormos in the <a href="Marmara_Sea" title="wikilink">Marmara Sea</a>, while Nikephoros' brothers were blinded as well.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The brothers are mentioned for the last time in 812, when, in the aftermath of the fall of <a href="Debeltum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Debeltum</a> to the Bulgars, a group of disgruntled soldiers tried to proclaim the brothers emperors. Emperor <a href="Michael_I_Rangabe" title="wikilink">Michael I Rangabe</a> (r. 811&lt;U+2013&gt;813) however promptly dismissed the soldiers involved, and moved the brothers to the island of Aphousia, where they died sometime later.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
