<p><strong>Aberdeen</strong>, often called <strong>The Granite City</strong> or <strong>The Silver City</strong>, is <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>'s third largest <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">city</a>, with a population of approximately 202,370<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Aberdeen is the chief commercial centre and <a href="port" title="wikilink">seaport</a> in the north-east of Scotland. The city is often referred to as the <strong>Oil Capital of Europe</strong> thanks to becoming, in the 1970s, a major service base for the extraction of <a href="crude_oil" title="wikilink">crude oil</a> in the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a>. The city forms the <strong>Aberdeen City</strong> <a href="unitary_authority" title="wikilink">unitary</a> <a href="council_area" title="wikilink">council area</a>, and it is surrounded by the <a href="Aberdeenshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aberdeenshire</a> council area. It mostly stands between the mouths of the rivers <a href="River_Don,_Aberdeenshire" title="wikilink">Don</a> and <a href="River_Dee,_Aberdeenshire" title="wikilink">Dee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Aberdeen_Market_Cross.jpg" title="fig:Aberdeen Mercat Cross" alt="Aberdeen Mercat Cross" /> Aberdeen grew up as two separate burghs: <a href="Old_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Old Aberdeen</a> at the mouth of the River Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement where the Denburn entered the Dee estuary. The earliest charter was granted by King <a href="William_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">William the Lion</a> about 1179, confirming the corporate rights granted by David I. The city received other royal charters later. In 1319, the Great Charter of <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert the Bruce</a> transformed Aberdeen into a property owning and financially independent community. Bruce had a high regard for the citizens of Aberdeen who had sheltered him in his days of outlawry, helped him win the Battle of Barra and slew the English garrison at the Castle. He granted Aberdeen with the nearby Forest of Stocket. The income from this land has formed the basis for the city's Common Good Fund, which is used to this day for the benefit of all Aberdonians.</p>
<p>The city was burned by <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III of England</a> in 1336, but was soon rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. For many centuries the city was subject to attacks by the neighbouring lords, and was strongly fortified, but the gates were all removed by 1770. In 1497 a blockhouse was built at the harbour mouth as a protection against the English. During the <a href="Scottish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Scottish Civil War</a> of 1644-47 between the Royalists and Covenanters the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and sacked by Royalist troops comprising of Irishmen and Highlanders after the <a href="battle_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">battle of Aberdeen</a>. 1647 saw the outbreak of <a href="bubonic_plague" title="wikilink">bubonic plague</a>, and a quarter of the population died. In 1715 the <a href="Earl_Marischal" title="wikilink">Earl Marischal</a> proclaimed the <a href="Old_Pretender" title="wikilink">Old Pretender</a> at Aberdeen, and in 1745 the <a href="Prince_William_Augustus,_Duke_of_Cumberland" title="wikilink">Duke of Cumberland</a> resided for a short time in the city before attacking the <a href="Young_Pretender" title="wikilink">Young Pretender</a>.</p>
<p>In the 18th century a new Town Hall was built, elegantly furnished with a marble fireplace from <a href="The_Netherlands" title="wikilink">Holland</a> and a set of fine crystal chandeliers and sconces. The latter are still a feature in the Town House. This century also saw the beginnings of social services for the <a href="Aberdeen_Royal_Infirmary" title="wikilink">Infirmary</a> at Woolmanhill which was opened in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779.</p>

<p>]] In the late 18th century, the council embarked on a scheme of road improvements, and by 1805 George Street, King Street and Union Street were open, the latter a feat of extraordinary engineering skill involving the partial levelling of St Catherine's Hill and the building of arches to carry the street over Putachieside. The Denburn Valley was crossed by Union Street with a single span arch of 130 ft (40 m). Along these new streets was built the nucleus of the <strong><em>Granite City</em></strong>, many of whose buildings were designed by John Smith and <a href="Archibald_Simpson" title="wikilink">Archibald Simpson</a>.</p>
<p>The 19th Century was a time of considerable expansion. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries brought a need for improved harbour facilities. During this century much of the harbour as it exists today was built including Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater and the extension to the North Pier. Such an expensive building programme had repercussions, and in 1817 the city was in a state of bankruptcy. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the <a href="Napoleonic_wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic wars</a>. Improvements in street lighting came in 1824 with the advent of gas, and a vast improvement was made to the water supply in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewerage system was begun in 1865 to replace the open sewers which previously ran along certain of the streets.</p>
<p>The city was first <a href="incorporation_(municipal_government)" title="wikilink">incorporated</a> in 1891. By 1901 the population was 153,000 and the city covered more than 6,000 acres (24 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;).</p>
<h2 id="present-day-aberdeen">Present-day Aberdeen</h2>
<p>Though <a href="Old_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Old Aberdeen</a> had a separate charter and history, it and New Aberdeen are no longer truly distinct. The area of the city extends to 71.22 square miles (184.46 <a href="square_kilometre" title="wikilink">km&lt;U+00B2&gt;</a>), and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Woodside and the <a href="Royal_Burgh" title="wikilink">Royal Burgh</a> of <a href="Torry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torry</a> to the south of the River Dee. The city is represented in the <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom Parliament</a> by two MPs who are both from the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>, and in the <a href="Scottish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Scottish Parliament</a> by three MSPs (one Labour, one <a href="Scottish_National_Party" title="wikilink">Scottish Nationalist</a> and one <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrat</a>). The city council comprises forty-three councillors who represent the city's <a href="ward_(politics)" title="wikilink">wards</a> and is headed by the Lord Provost. The current <a href="List_of_Provosts_and_Lord_Provosts_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Lord Provost</a> is John Reynolds.</p>
<p>As of 1996, Aberdeen has been governed by the unitary <a href="City_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Aberdeen City Council</a> and no longer has any direct control over the neighbouring area of <a href="Aberdeenshire_(unitary)" title="wikilink">Aberdeenshire</a>, although the headquarters of Aberdeenshire Council are located within the city. Since the 2003 election, the city has been run by a coalition of 20 Scottish Liberal Democrat and 3 Conservative councillors.</p>
<h2 id="population">Population</h2>
<p>In 1396 the population was about 3,000. By 1801 it had become 26,992; in 1841 it was 63,262; (1891) 121,623; (1901) 153,503; in 2001 it was 212,125. The latest official population estimate, published by the General Register for Scotland for 2005, is 202,370.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this growth, it is expected that the population will decline sharply and that it will be around 155,000 by 2024. However, due to recent additions to the EU, the population of Aberdeen is likely to rise as has been seen in recent years.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
<p>The mean temperature is 8 &lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">C</a> (47 &lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">F</a>) and it varies between 2.6 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (36.7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) in winter and 16.1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (60.9 &lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">F</a>) in summer.

<h2 id="coat-of-arms-and-motto">Coat of Arms and Motto</h2>
<p>The <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> shows a red shield bearing three triple towered castles within the double royal tressure. It is widely accepted that these represent the <a href="fortification" title="wikilink">fortifications</a> which from earliest times stood on the three hills where the city sprang up, namely Castle Hill, the Port or Windmill Hill (now Gallowgate) and St Catherine's Hill (around the present Adelphi). The Arms are supported by two leopards – one either side – and above, the scroll with the words &quot;Bon Accord&quot;.</p>
<p>Legend has it that during the <a href="Wars_of_Scottish_Independence" title="wikilink">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, when the Castle of Aberdeen was stormed and the English troops &quot;were killed all in one night&quot;, the secret phrase to initiate the campaign was &quot;Bon Accord&quot;, and it is from this massacre that the Coat of Arms and the motto originated.</p>

<h3 id="granite-city">Granite city</h3>
<p>Union Street is one of the most imposing and famous thoroughfares in Britain. From Castle Street it runs for nearly a mile (1.5 km), is 70 ft (21 m) wide, and originally contained the principal shops and most of the public buildings, all of granite. Part of the street crosses the Denburn ravine (utilized for the line of the Great North of Scotland railway) by Union Bridge, a fine granite arch of 132 ft (40 m) span, with portions of the older town still fringing the gorge, 50 feet (15 m) below the level of Union Street. Union Street was built from 1801 to 1805, and named after the 1800 Act of Union with <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst the notable buildings in the street are the Town and County Bank, the Music Hall, the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (originating between 1398 and 1527), now a shopping mall; the Palace Hotel; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the National Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the Town House, the headquarters of the city council. One of the most splendid granite edifices in Scotland, in the Franco-Scottish Gothic style, it contains the great hall, with an open timber ceiling and oak-panelled walls; the Sheriff Court House; the <a href="Town_and_County_Hall" title="wikilink">Town and County Hall</a>, with portraits of <a href="Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a>, the 4th <a href="Earl_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Earl of Aberdeen</a>, various Lord Provosts and other distinguished citizens. In the vestibule of the entrance corridor stands a suit of black armour, believed to have been worn by Provost <a href="Sir_Robert_Davidson" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Davidson</a>, who fought in the <a href="Battle_of_Harlaw" title="wikilink">Battle of Harlaw</a> in 1411. On the south-western corner is the 210 ft (64 m) grand tower, which commands a fine view of the city and surrounding country. Adjoining the Town House is the old North of Scotland Bank building, in <a href="Greek_Revival" title="wikilink">Greek Revival</a> style. This building is now a pub named the <a href="Archibald_Simpson" title="wikilink">Archibald Simpson</a>, after its original architect. On the opposite side of the street is the fine building of the Union Bank, redeveloped in 2005 as the High Court. The third permanent high court to sit in Scotland.</p>
<p>At the upper end of Castlegate stands <a href="The_Salvation_Army" title="wikilink">The Salvation Army</a> Citadel, an effective castellated mansion, on the site of the medieval castle. In front of it is the <a href="Mercat_Cross" title="wikilink">Mercat Cross</a>, built in 1686 by <a href="John_Montgomery" title="wikilink">John Montgomery</a>, a native architect. This open-arched structure, 21 ft (6 m) in diameter and 18 ft (5 m) high, comprises a large hexagonal base from the centre of which rises a shaft with a Corinthian capital, on which is the royal <a href="unicorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">unicorn</a>. The base is highly decorated, including medallions illustrating Scottish monarchs from <a href="James_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James I</a> to <a href="James_VII_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James VII</a>. To the east of Castle Street were the military barracks, which were demolished in 1965 and replaced with two tower blocks.</p>
<p><a href="Marischal_College" title="wikilink">Marischal College</a> on Broad Street, opened by King <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward VII</a> in 1906, is the second largest granite building in the world (after the <a href="Escorial" class="uri" title="wikilink">Escorial</a>, <a href="Madrid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madrid</a>), and is one of the most splendid examples of Edwardian architecture in Britain. The architect, <a href="Alexander_Marshall_Mackenzie" title="wikilink">Alexander Marshall Mackenzie</a>, a native of Aberdeen, adapted his material, white granite, to the design of the building with the originality of genius. This magnificent building is sadly no longer a seat of learning and is under renovation as the new home of Aberdeen City Council.</p>
<h3 id="churches">Churches</h3>
<p>Aberdeen has many churches, with many different denominations represented. The largest (in terms of membership) is the <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a>. The Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Aberdeen has 41 parish churches.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> there was only one burgh kirk - the <a href="Kirk_of_St_Nicholas,_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Kirk of St Nicholas</a>, one of <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>'s largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the <a href="Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reformation</a>, in this case into the East and West churches. The Kirk of St Nicholas congregation is now an ecumenical partnership in membership of both the <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a> and the <a href="United_Reformed_Church" title="wikilink">United Reformed Church</a>. The large <a href="kirkyard" class="uri" title="wikilink">kirkyard</a> of the Kirk of St Nicholas is separated from Union Street by a 147 ft (45 m) long Ionic facade, built in 1830. The divided church within, with a central tower and spire, forms one continuous building 220 ft (67 m) in length.</p>
<p>The pre-Reformation <a href="Diocese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocese</a> of Aberdeen is said to have been first founded at Mortlach in <a href="Banffshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banffshire</a> by <a href="Malcolm_II_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Coluim II</a> (1005-34) to celebrate his victory there over the Danes, but in 1137 <a href="David_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">David I</a> (1124-53) transferred the <a href="bishopric" class="uri" title="wikilink">bishopric</a> to Old Aberdeen, and twenty years later <a href="St_Machar&#39;s_Cathedral" title="wikilink">St Machar's Cathedral</a> was begun, a few hundred yards from the Don. With the exception of the period of the episcopate of <a href="William_Elphinstone" title="wikilink">William Elphinstone</a> (1484-1511), building progressed slowly. <a href="Gavin_Dunbar" title="wikilink">Gavin Dunbar</a>, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. The church suffered severely at the <a href="Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reformation</a>, but is still used by the <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a> as a parish church.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, Aberdeen contained houses of the <a href="Carmelites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carmelites</a> (<a href="Whitefriars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitefriars</a>) and <a href="Franciscans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Franciscans</a> (<a href="Greyfriars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greyfriars</a>), the latter surviving in modified form as the chapel of <a href="Marischal_College" title="wikilink">Marischal College</a> as late as the early 20th Century.</p>
<p><a href="St._Mary&#39;s_Cathedral,_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">St. Mary's Cathedral</a> is the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> Cathedral. A <a href="Gothic_style" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> building, it was erected in 1859.</p>
<p><a href="St._Andrew&#39;s_Cathedral,_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">St. Andrew's Cathedral</a> is the <a href="Scottish_Episcopal_Church" title="wikilink">Scottish Episcopal</a> Cathedral. It was constructed in 1817 and was Archibald Simpson's first commission. The Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is notable for having consecrated the first bishop of the <a href="Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a>, <a href="Samuel_Seabury" title="wikilink">Samuel Seabury</a>. The cathedral was renovated in the 1930s to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Seabury's consecration. The memorial was dedicated with a ceremony attended by the then U.S. ambassador to the UK, <a href="Joseph_P._Kennedy,_Sr" title="wikilink">Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr</a>.</p>
<p>Also churches still in use today are located in the city centre including Bon Accord Free Church which is situated on <a href="Rosemount,_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Rosemount</a> <a href="viaduct" class="uri" title="wikilink">viaduct</a> near <a href="His_Majesty&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">His Majesty's Theatre</a> and <a href="Gilcomston_South_Church" title="wikilink">Gilcomston South Church</a> situated at the corner of Union Street and Summer Street. Many other churches in the city centre have been converted into bars and restaurants.</p>
<h3 id="bridges">Bridges</h3>
<p>The Dee is crossed by a number of bridges, from east to west:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Victoria Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Queen Elizabeth Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wellington Suspension Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Railway bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>King George VI Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bridge of Dee</strong></li>
<li><strong>St. Devenick's Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maryculter Bridge</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Until 1832, the only access to the city from the south was the Bridge of Dee. It consists of seven semicircular ribbed arches, is about 30 ft (10 m) high, and was built early in the 16th Century by Bishops Elphinstone and Dunbar. It was nearly all rebuilt 1718-23, and in 1842 was widened from 14 to 26 ft (4 to 8 m). This was the site of a battle in 1639 between the Royalists under Viscount Aboyne and the Covenanters who were led by the Marquis of Montrose.</p>
<p>St. Devenick's Bridge, which crosses the Dee from Ardoe to <a href="Cults" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cults</a>, was built in 1837 to link the now ruined Banchory Devenick Parish Church, on the south bank of the Dee, with its parishioners, who lived on the north bank. It was officially named St. Devenick's Bridge, but is popularly known by Aberdonians as the <em>Shakin' Briggie</em> or <em>Shakkin Briggie</em>, or as <em>Morison's Bridge</em>. The cast-iron pedestrian footbridge was damaged by floods in 1876 and 1920, and was reconstructed in the 1920s. However, due to erosion, the Dee shifted its course in the 1970s and 1980s, sweeping away the southern approach spans, and in 1984 the decking was removed as a safety precation. The bridge is a Category A listed structure and there are plans to restore it.</p>
<p>More information on the Victoria and Wellington bridges is in the article on <a href="Torry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torry</a>, the area on the south of the Dee to which they connect.</p>
<p>Maryculter Bridge links the North and South Deeside roads near the village of <a href="Maryculter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryculter</a> close to the boundary of the council area, the bridge is earmarked for expansion as part of the proposed Western Peripheral Route to bypass the city.</p>
<p>From east to west the Don is crossed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridge of Don</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="Brig_o&#39;_Balgownie" title="wikilink">Brig o' Balgownie</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Grandholm Bridge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Persley Bridge</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Bridge of Don has five granite arches, each 75 ft (23 m) in span, and was built 1827-1832. A little to the west is the Auld <a href="Brig_o&#39;_Balgownie" title="wikilink">Brig o' Balgownie</a>, a picturesque single arch spanning the deep black stream, said to have been built by <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">King Robert I</a>, and celebrated by <a href="George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron" title="wikilink">George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron</a> in the tenth canto of &quot;<a href="Don_Juan" title="wikilink">Don Juan</a>&quot;. It is closed to motor vehicles. The Grandholm Bridge is a private bridge, constructed for the <a href="Crombie_Mills" title="wikilink">Crombie Mills</a> in the 1920s. Access to the bridge, other than for pedestrians and bicycles, is now controlled by an electronically activated barrier, passes for which are made available to residents of the housing development constructed on the site of the mills in 2004.</p>
<h3 id="statues">Statues</h3>
<p>Adjacent to <a href="Union_Terrace_Gardens" title="wikilink">Union Terrace Gardens</a> stands a colossal bronze statue of <a href="William_Wallace" title="wikilink">William Wallace</a>, by W. G. Stevenson. Also nearby these same gardens are a bronze statue of <a href="Robert_Burns" title="wikilink">Robert Burns</a> and <a href="Charles_Marochetti" title="wikilink">Charles Marochetti</a>'s seated figure of <a href="Prince_Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a>.</p>
<p>In front of Robert Gordon's College is the bronze statue, by T. S. Burnett, of <a href="Charles_George_Gordon" title="wikilink">General Gordon</a>. At Queen's Cross roundabout stands the bronze statue of Queen Victoria, erected in 1893 by the royal tradesmen of the city. Near the Cross stands the granite statue of George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon.</p>
<p>There is a 70 ft (21 m) high <a href="obelisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">obelisk</a> of <a href="Peterhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peterhead</a> granite, originally erected in the square of Marischal College, to the memory of Sir James McGrigor (1778-1851), the military surgeon and director-general of the Army Medical Department, who was thrice elected lord <a href="rector" class="uri" title="wikilink">rector</a> of the College. In the 1890s when the College was extended, the obelisk was moved to Duthie Park. There is also a statue commemorating <a href="Lord_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a> in the front grounds of <a href="Aberdeen_Grammar_School" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Grammar School</a>.</p>
<h3 id="harbour">Harbour</h3>
<p><img src="Aberdeen_Harbour.jpg" title="fig:A ship in Aberdeen Harbour." alt="A ship in Aberdeen Harbour." /> Aberdeen Harbour is the principal commercial port in northern Scotland and an international port for general cargo, roll-on/roll-off from and container traffic.</p>
<p>Originally, the defective harbour, with a shallow sand and gravel bar at its entrance, retarded the trade of Aberdeen, but under various acts since 1773 it was greatly deepened. The north pier, built partly by <a href="John_Smeaton" title="wikilink">John Smeaton</a> 1775-81, and partly by <a href="Thomas_Telford" title="wikilink">Thomas Telford</a> 1810-15, extends nearly 3,000 ft (1000 m) into the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> and raised the bar. A wet dock of 29 acres (117,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) and with 6000 ft (1800 m) of quay, was completed in 1848 and called Victoria Dock in honour of the queen's visit to the city in that year. Adjoining it is the Upper Dock. By the <a href="Harbour_Act_of_1868" title="wikilink">Harbour Act of 1868</a>, the Dee near the harbour was diverted from the south at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;80,000, and 90 acres (364,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of new ground, in addition to 25 acres (101,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) formerly made up, were provided on the north side of the river for the Albert Basin (with a graving dock), quays and warehouses. A 1050 ft (320 m) long concrete <a href="Breakwater_(structure)" title="wikilink">breakwater</a> was constructed on the south side of the stream as a protection against south-easterly gales. On Girdleness, the southern point of the bay, a <a href="lighthouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">lighthouse</a> was built in 1833. Thirty-two people were drowned in the harbour on <a href="5_April" title="wikilink">5 April</a> <a href="1876" class="uri" title="wikilink">1876</a>, in the <a href="River_Dee_Ferry_Boat_Disaster" title="wikilink">River Dee Ferry Boat Disaster</a>. The harbour serves Northlink Ferries, which sail to <a href="Kirkwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kirkwall</a> and the <a href="Shetland_Islands" title="wikilink">Shetland Islands</a>.

<p>Owing to the variety and importance of its chief industries Aberdeen is one of the most prosperous cities in Scotland. Very durable grey granite was <a href="quarry" title="wikilink">quarried</a> at <a href="Rubislaw_quarry" title="wikilink">Rubislaw quarry</a> for more than 300 years, and blocked and dressed paving &quot;setts&quot;, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental work of granite have long been exported from the district to all parts of the world. The terraces of the <a href="Houses_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Houses of Parliament</a> and <a href="Waterloo_Bridge" title="wikilink">Waterloo Bridge</a> in London were built from Aberdeen granite. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971.</p>
<p>This, though once the predominant industry, was surpassed by the deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th Century. Lately, however, catches have fallen due to overfishing in previous years, and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels. Aberdeen remains an important fishing port, but the catch landed there is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of <a href="Peterhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peterhead</a> and <a href="Fraserburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fraserburgh</a>. The <a href="Fisheries_Research_Services" title="wikilink">Fisheries Research Services</a> is based in Aberdeen, including its headquarters and a marine research lab.</p>
<p>In addition to fisheries research, Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research that takes place at <a href="The_Macaulay_Institute" title="wikilink">The Macaulay Institute</a>, which has close links to the city's two universities. The <a href="Rowett_Research_Institute" title="wikilink">Rowett Research Institute</a> is a world renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen, it has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of <a href="life_scientists" title="wikilink">life scientists</a> working in the city.</p>
<p>Most of the leading pre-1970s industries date from the 18th Century, amongst them <a href="wool" title="wikilink">woollens</a> (1703), <a href="linen" class="uri" title="wikilink">linen</a> (1749), and <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> (1779). These gave employment to several thousands of operatives. The <a href="paper" class="uri" title="wikilink">paper</a>-making industry is one of the most famous and oldest in the city, paper having been first made in Aberdeen in 1694. The industry has however, all but collapsed. Donside Paper Mill closed in 2001 and the Davidson Mill (run by BPB Paperboard) in 2005. <a href="Flax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flax</a>-<a href="Spinning_(textiles)" title="wikilink">spinning</a> and <a href="jute" class="uri" title="wikilink">jute</a> and <a href="comb" title="wikilink">combmaking</a> factories also flourished, along with successful <a href="foundry" title="wikilink">foundries</a> and engineering works.</p>
<p><a href="Richards_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Richards of Aberdeen</a> textile mill also closed in November 2004, bringing an industry spanning hundreds of years to a painful close.</p>
<p>In the days of wooden ships <a href="ship-building" class="uri" title="wikilink">ship-building</a> was a flourishing industry, the town being noted for its fast <a href="clipper" title="wikilink">clippers</a>, many of which established records in the &quot;tea races&quot;. The introduction of trawling revived this to some extent, and despite the distance of the city from the <a href="iron" class="uri" title="wikilink">iron</a> fields there was a fair yearly output of iron vessels. The last major shipbuilder in Aberdeen, <a href="Hall_Russell" title="wikilink">Hall Russell</a>, closed in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>With the discovery of significant <a href="North_Sea_oil" title="wikilink">oil deposits</a> in the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> during the late 20th Century, Aberdeen became the centre of <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>'s <a href="petroleum" class="uri" title="wikilink">petroleum</a> industry, with the port serving <a href="oil_rig" title="wikilink">oil rigs</a> off-shore. The number of jobs created by the energy industry in and around Aberdeen has been estimated at half a million. In 1988, the city was dealt a heavy blow by the loss-of-life suffered during an explosion and fire aboard one such rig, the <a href="Piper_Alpha" title="wikilink">Piper Alpha</a>.</p>

<li>The <a href="A90_road" title="wikilink">A90</a> is the main arterial route into the city from the North and South, linking Aberdeen to <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Dundee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dundee</a> and <a href="Perth,_Scotland" title="wikilink">Perth</a> in the South and <a href="Ellon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ellon</a>, <a href="Peterhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peterhead</a> and <a href="Fraserburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fraserburgh</a> in the north.</li>
<li>The <a href="A96_road" title="wikilink">A96</a> links to <a href="Elgin,_Moray" title="wikilink">Elgin</a> and <a href="Inverness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inverness</a> and the North West.</li>
<li>The <a href="A93_road" title="wikilink">A93</a> is the main route to the West, heading towards <a href="Royal_Deeside" title="wikilink">Royal Deeside</a> and the <a href="Cairngorms" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairngorms</a>. After <a href="Braemar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braemar</a>, it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth.</li>
<li>The <a href="A92_road" title="wikilink">A92</a> was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of <a href="Montrose,_Angus" title="wikilink">Montrose</a>, <a href="Arbroath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arbroath</a> and <a href="Brechin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brechin</a> on the east coast.</li>
<li>The <a href="A947_road" title="wikilink">A947</a> exits the city at Dyce and goes on to <a href="Newmachar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newmachar</a>, <a href="Oldmeldrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oldmeldrum</a> and <a href="Turriff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turriff</a> finally ending at <a href="Banff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banff</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The city's original ring road, Anderson Drive, was built in the 1930s but has long since been engulfed by the sprawling expansion of the city, and is inadequate for dealing with today's traffic. To this end, a new main bypass road, the Western Peripheral Route, is proposed to divert through traffic away from the city centre. The road is expected to open in 2010.</p>
<p>Buses in Aberdeen are operated by <a href="First_Group" title="wikilink">First Group</a> (whose headquarters are in the city) and also <a href="Stagecoach_Group" title="wikilink">Stagecoach Group</a>. <em>First Aberdeen</em> have the largest share of routes in the city with 22 services running throughout the city.</p>
<p>The city is well served by the national <a href="railway" class="uri" title="wikilink">railway</a> network. <a href="Aberdeen_railway_station" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Joint Station</a> has regular rail services to <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> and Edinburgh as well as long distance trains to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Regular trains also run north westerly towards Inverness and north to <a href="Dyce" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dyce</a> for the airport. The <a href="Royal_Deeside_Line" title="wikilink">Royal Deeside Line</a> which ran west of the city to <a href="Ballater" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballater</a> opened in 1853 but the <a href="Beeching_Report" title="wikilink">Beeching Report</a> led to the closure of the line in 1966. The line is now a popular walk and cycle route.</p>
<p><a href="Aberdeen_Airport" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Airport</a>, in the neighbouring town of Dyce, serves European destinations for passenger and freight flights and is the largest <a href="helicopter" class="uri" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> terminal in the world, serving the many North Sea oil installations. The <a href="IATA_airport_code" title="wikilink">IATA airport code</a> for the airport is ABZ.</p>
<p>The last <a href="tram" class="uri" title="wikilink">tram</a> ran on <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a> <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a>. All but one were then scrapped; the last is on display in the <a href="Grampian_Transport_Museum" title="wikilink">Grampian Transport Museum</a> at <a href="Alford,_Aberdeenshire" title="wikilink">Alford, Aberdeenshire</a>.</p>
