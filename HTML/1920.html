<p><strong>Montague John Druitt</strong> (15 August 1857 &lt;U+2013&gt; early December 1888)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was one of the suspects in the <a href="Jack_the_Ripper" title="wikilink">Jack the Ripper</a> murders that took place in London between August and November 1888.</p>
<p>He came from an upper-middle class English background, and studied at <a href="Winchester_College" title="wikilink">Winchester College</a> and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he took a position at a <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a> and pursued a parallel career in the law; he qualified as a <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a> in 1885. His main interest outside work was cricket, which he played with many leading players of the time, including <a href="George_Harris,_4th_Baron_Harris" title="wikilink">Lord Harris</a> and <a href="Francis_Lacey" title="wikilink">Francis Lacey</a>.</p>
<p>In November 1888, he lost his post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was found drowned in the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>. His death, which was found to be a suicide, roughly coincided with the end of the murders that were attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely <a href="circumstantial_evidence" title="wikilink">circumstantial</a>, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.</p>

<p>Druitt was born in <a href="Wimborne_Minster" title="wikilink">Wimborne Minster</a>, Dorset, England. He was the second son and third child of prominent local surgeon William Druitt, and his wife Ann (<em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Harvey).

<p><img src="Herbert_Railton_-_The_Inner_Temple_Library_(modified).jpg" title="fig:The Inner Temple, 1895 Sketch by Herbert Railton" alt="The Inner Temple, 1895 Sketch by Herbert Railton" /> On 17 May 1882, two years after graduation, Druitt was admitted to the <a href="Inner_Temple" title="wikilink">Inner Temple</a>, one of the qualifying bodies for English <a href="barrister" title="wikilink">barristers</a>. His father had promised him a legacy of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500 (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt; today), and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was called to the <a href="bar_(law)" title="wikilink">bar</a> on 29 April 1885, and set up a practice as a barrister and <a href="special_pleader" title="wikilink">special pleader</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Druitt's father died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at &lt;U+00A3&gt;16,579 (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt; today).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In a <a href="Codicil_(will)" title="wikilink">codicil</a>, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>To supplement his income and help pay for his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a>, 9 Eliot Place, <a href="Blackheath,_London" title="wikilink">Blackheath, London</a>, from 1880 .<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The school had a long and distinguished history; <a href="Benjamin_Disraeli" title="wikilink">Benjamin Disraeli</a> had been a pupil there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, <a href="Prince_Arthur,_Duke_of_Connaught" title="wikilink">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught</a>, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at <a href="Greenwich_Park" title="wikilink">Greenwich Park</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave him time to study the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cricket">Cricket</h2>
<p>In Dorset, Druitt played for the Kingston Park Cricket Club,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and the <a href="Dorset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Dorset County Cricket Club</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He was particularly noted for his skill as a bowler.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 1882 and 1883, he toured the <a href="West_Country" title="wikilink">West Country</a> with a gentleman's touring team called the <a href="Incogniti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Incogniti</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> One of Druitt's fellow local players was <a href="Francis_Lacey" title="wikilink">Francis Lacey</a>, the first man knighted for services to cricket.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his <em>alma mater</em> Winchester College.

<p>On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder <a href="Vernon_Royle" title="wikilink">Vernon Royle</a>, who seconded his nomination.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler <a href="William_Attewell" title="wikilink">William Attewell</a> against <a href="Harrow_School" title="wikilink">Harrow School</a> on 10 June 1886.

<p>In June 1888, Lord Harris played twice for Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt was off form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a> against the <a href="Parsees_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Parsees cricket team</a> during <a href="Parsee_cricket_team_in_England_in_1888" title="wikilink">their tour of England</a>, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings.

<p>On Friday 30 November 1888, Druitt was dismissed from his post at the Blackheath boys' school. The reason for his dismissal is unclear.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> One newspaper, quoting his brother William's inquest testimony, reported that he was dismissed because he &quot;had got into serious trouble&quot;, but did not specify any further.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In early December 1888, he disappeared, and on 21 December 1888 the Blackheath Cricket Club's minute book records that he was removed as treasurer and secretary in the belief that he had &quot;gone abroad&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>Some modern authors suggest that Druitt was dismissed because he was a homosexual or <a href="pederast" class="uri" title="wikilink">pederast</a> and that it may have driven him to suicide.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Others, however, think that there is no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane; his aunt attempted suicide; and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath.

<p>As was usual in the district, the inquest was held at the Lamb Tap <a href="public_house" title="wikilink">public house</a>, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock on 2 January 1889.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The coroner's jury concluded that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an unsound state of mind.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> At probate, his estate was valued at &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,600 (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt; today).<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>It is not known why Druitt committed suicide in Chiswick. One suggested link is that one of his University friends, Thomas Seymour Tuke of the <a href="Tuke_family" title="wikilink">Tuke family</a>, lived there. Tuke was a psychiatric doctor with whom Druitt played cricket, and Druitt's mother was committed to Tuke's asylum in 1890.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Another suggestion is that Druitt knew Harry Wilson, whose house, &quot;The Osiers&quot;, lay between Hammersmith station and Thornycroft's wharf, where Druitt's body was found.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Druitt was a favoured suspect in the Jack the Ripper crimes throughout the 1960s, until the advent of theories in the 1970s that the murders were not the work of a single serial killer but the result of a conspiracy involving the <a href="British_Royal_Family" title="wikilink">British royal family</a> and <a href="Freemasonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freemasonry</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> The theories are widely condemned as ridiculous,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and implicate <a href="Prince_Albert_Victor,_Duke_of_Clarence_and_Avondale" title="wikilink">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, his tutor <a href="James_Kenneth_Stephen" title="wikilink">James Stephen</a>, and their doctor <a href="Sir_William_Gull,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Sir William Gull</a> to varying degrees. One version of the conspiracy promoted by <a href="Stephen_Knight_(author)" title="wikilink">Stephen Knight</a> in his 1976 book <em><a href="Jack_the_Ripper:_The_Final_Solution" title="wikilink">Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution</a></em> supposed that Druitt was a scapegoat, chosen by officialdom to take the blame for the murders.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Martin Howells and Keith Skinner followed the same line in their 1987 book <em>The Ripper Legacy</em>, which was panned by one critic as being based on &quot;no evidence whatever&quot;.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>The theories attempted to link Druitt with Clarence, Gull and Stephen through a network of mutual acquaintances and possible connections. <a href="Reginald_Acland" title="wikilink">Reginald Acland</a>, the brother of Gull's son-in-law, had legal chambers in King's Bench Walk near Druitt's,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> as did Harry Stephen, who was James Stephen's brother. Harry Stephen was good friends with Harry Wilson, who had a house in Chiswick, &quot;The Osiers&quot;, near to where Druitt's body was found.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Wilson and James Stephen were close friends of Clarence, and were both members of an exclusive society called the <a href="Cambridge_Apostles" title="wikilink">Cambridge Apostles</a>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> As a schoolboy, Druitt had played cricket against two of Wilson's friends, <a href="Kynaston_Studd" title="wikilink">Kynaston Studd</a> and Henry Goodhart, who was also one of the Apostles.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Another potential connection between Druitt and Wilson is through John Henry Lonsdale. Lonsdale's name and Blackheath address are written in a diary belonging to Wilson now in the possession of <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. Lonsdale's address is a few yards from the school at which Druitt worked and lived, and Lonsdale had been a barrister and had also rented legal chambers in King's Bench Walk. In 1887, Lonsdale entered the church and was assigned as curate to Wimborne Minster, where the Druitt family worshiped. Lonsdale and Macnaghten were classmates at <a href="Eton_College" title="wikilink">Eton</a>, and so theorists argue that Lonsdale might have been in a position to provide &quot;private information&quot; to Macnaghten regarding Druitt.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> The connections between the Apostles and Druitt led to the suggestion that he was part of the same social set.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Druitt, his mother and his sister Georgiana were invited to a ball in honour of Clarence at the home of <a href="Ivor_Guest,_1st_Baron_Wimborne" title="wikilink">Lord Wimborne</a> on 17 December 1888, although they did not attend because by that time Montague was dead, his mother was in an asylum, and his sister was expecting her second child.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Clarence, Stephen, Wilson, Studd, and Goodhart are suggested to have been homosexual,<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> although this is contested by historians.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> John Wilding's 1993 book <em>Jack the Ripper Revealed</em> used the connections between Druitt and Stephen to propose that they committed the crimes together, but reviewers considered it an &quot;imaginative tale ... most questionable&quot;,<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> an &quot;exercise in ingenuity rather than ... fact&quot;,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> and &quot;lack[ing] evidential support&quot;.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>In his 2005 and 2006 biographies of Druitt, D. J. Leighton concluded that Druitt was innocent,<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Leighton suggested that Druitt could have been murdered either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner,<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> out of fear of exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on <a href="homophobia" class="uri" title="wikilink">homophobia</a> rather than evidence.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>The accusations against Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on cultural perceptions of a decadent aristocracy, and depict an upper-class murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> As Druitt and the other aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on the residents of the <a href="Whitechapel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitechapel</a> slums.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one based on a Whitechapel resident.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> There is no direct evidence against Druitt,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> and since the 1970s, the number of <a href="Jack_the_Ripper_suspects" title="wikilink">Jack the Ripper suspects</a> has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<p>In fiction, Druitt is depicted as the murderer in the musical <em>Jack the Ripper</em> by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In <a href="John_Gardner_(British_writer)" title="wikilink">John Gardner's</a> <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> story <em>The Revenge of Moriarty</em>, <a href="Professor_Moriarty" title="wikilink">Professor Moriarty</a>'s criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity as a result of the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> The TV series <em><a href="Sanctuary_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Sanctuary</a></em> depicts <a href="List_of_Sanctuary_characters#John_Druitt" title="wikilink">John Druitt</a> as a scientist with the ability to teleport. Druitt is inhabited by an evil energy being, goes mad and becomes Jack the Ripper. His ability to teleport explains how he committed the murders when historical records show him distant from the crime scenes. In the anime <em><a href="Black_Butler" title="wikilink">Kuroshitsuji</a></em>, the Viscount of Druitt is a suspect in the murders of several prostitutes, also dubbed the &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; case. In <a href="Alan_Moore" title="wikilink">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="Eddie_Campbell" title="wikilink">Eddie Campbell</a>'s graphic novel <em><a href="From_Hell" title="wikilink">From Hell</a></em>, which was based on Stephen Knight's book, Druitt is portrayed as a feminist with a deep love of cricket who is framed by the Freemasons as being a paedophile and misogynist; the Freemasons plant &quot;clues&quot; that he is Jack the Ripper and kill him, faking it as suicide, to ensure that he is not tried.</p>
