<p>The <strong>Overman Committee</strong> was a special <a href="United_States_Congressional_subcommittee" title="wikilink">subcommittee</a> of the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a> <a href="Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary" title="wikilink">Committee on the Judiciary</a> chaired by <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> <a href="Lee_Slater_Overman" title="wikilink">Lee Slater Overman</a>. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it investigated German and <a href="Bolshevism" title="wikilink">Bolshevik</a> elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known <a href="House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="wikilink">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism.</p>
<p>The Committee's final report was released in June 1919. It reported on German <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a>, Bolshevism, and other &quot;un-American activities&quot; in the United States and on likely effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It described German, but not communist, propaganda efforts. The Committee's report and hearings were instrumental in fostering anti-Bolshevik opinion.</p>

<p>World War I, in which the United States and its allies fought the <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">German Empire</a>, raised concern about the German threat to the United States. The <a href="Espionage_Act_of_1917" title="wikilink">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and the <a href="Sedition_Act_of_1918" title="wikilink">Sedition Act of 1918</a> were passed in response.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Archibald E.

The United States' wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that ruled Russia and threatened America anew. &quot;The Bolsheviki movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He cited the propaganda efforts of <a href="John_Reed_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Reed</a> and gave many examples from the foreign press.

<p>The final catalyst for the expansion of the investigation was the <a href="Seattle_General_Strike" title="wikilink">Seattle General Strike</a>, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="bolshevism-hearings">Bolshevism hearings</h2>

<p>The Overman Committee's hearings on Bolshevism lasted from February 11 to March 10, 1919.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> More than two dozen witnesses were interviewed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> About two-thirds were violently anti-Bolshevik and advocated for military intervention in Russia.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Some were refugees of the <a href="Russian_Diaspora" title="wikilink">Russian Diaspora</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;many former government officials<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who left Russia because of Bolshevism.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The overriding theme was the social chaos the Revolution had brought,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> but three sub-themes were also frequent: anti-Americanism among American intelligentsia, the relationship between <a href="Jews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jews</a> and Communist Russia, and the &quot;nationalization&quot; of women after the Soviet revolution.</p>
<p>Stevenson produced a list of 200&lt;U+2014&gt;later reduced to 62&lt;U+2014&gt;alleged communist <a href="professors" class="uri" title="wikilink">professors</a> in the United States.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Like lists of names provided during the German propaganda hearings, this list provoked an outcry.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Stevenson declared universities to be breeding grounds of <a href="sedition" class="uri" title="wikilink">sedition</a>, and that institutions of higher learning were &quot;festering masses of pure <a href="atheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheism</a>&quot; and &quot;the grossest kind of <a href="materialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">materialism</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="United_States_Ambassador_to_Russia" title="wikilink">Ambassador to Russia</a> <a href="David_R._Francis" title="wikilink">David R.

<p>Another recurring theme at the hearings was the <a href="Jewish_Bolshevism" title="wikilink">relationship between Jews and communists in Russia</a>. One <a href="Methodist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Methodist</a> preacher stated that nineteen out of twenty communists were Jews;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> others said the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a> was composed mainly of former <a href="Lower_East_Side" title="wikilink">East Side</a> New York Jews.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> However, after criticism from Jewish organizations,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Senator Overman clarified that the Committee was discussing &quot;apostate&quot; Jews only, defined by witness George Simons as &quot;one who has given up the faith of his fathers or forefathers.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>A third frequent theme was the &quot;free love&quot; and &quot;<a href="nationalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">nationalization</a>&quot; of women allegedly occurring in Soviet Russia.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Witnesses described an orgy in which there was no &quot;respect for virtuous women&quot;;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> others who testified, including those who had been in Russia during the Revolution,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> denied this.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the &quot;right to choose from among men&quot;,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Senator Sterling threw up his hands and declared that this was a negation of &quot;free love&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> However, another decree was produced stating, &quot;A girl having reached her eighteenth year is to be announced as the property of the state.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the <a href="Left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left</a>, including <a href="anarchists" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchists</a> and socialists of many types,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> &quot;providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Senator <a href="Knute_Nelson" title="wikilink">Knute Nelson</a> of <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> responded: &quot;Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 1, 1919, a month after the Committee's hearings ended, a bomb was mailed to Overman's home, one of a series of letter bombs sent to prominent Americans in the <a href="1919_United_States_anarchist_bombings" title="wikilink">1919 United States anarchist bombings</a>.
