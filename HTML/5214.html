<p><strong>20 cent <a href="euro_coins" title="wikilink">euro coins</a></strong> (&lt;U+20AC&gt;0.20) have a value of one fifth of a <a href="euro" class="uri" title="wikilink">euro</a> and are composed of an <a href="alloy" class="uri" title="wikilink">alloy</a> called <a href="nordic_gold" title="wikilink">nordic gold</a> in the <a href="Spanish_flower" title="wikilink">Spanish flower</a> shape. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The coin dates from 2002, when <a href="euro_coins" title="wikilink">euro coins</a> and <a href="euro_banknotes" title="wikilink">banknotes</a> were introduced in the 12 member <a href="eurozone" class="uri" title="wikilink">eurozone</a> and its <a href="Eurozone#Use_outside_the_Union" title="wikilink">related territories</a>. The common side was designed by <a href="Luc_Luycx" title="wikilink">Luc Luycx</a>, a <a href="Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgian</a> artist who won a Europe-wide competition to design the new coins. The design of the 10 to 50 cent coins were intended to show separate <a href="Member_state_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">states</a> of the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> (EU), as opposed to the one and two euro coins showing the 15 states as one and the 1 to 5 cent coins showing the EU's place in the world.</p>
<p>The national sides, then 15 (eurozone + <a href="Monaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monaco</a>, <a href="San_Marino" title="wikilink">San Marino</a> and the <a href="Vatican_City" title="wikilink">Vatican</a> who could mint their own) were each designed according to national competitions, though to specifications which applied to all coins such as the requirement of including twelve stars (see <a href="euro_coins" title="wikilink">euro coins</a> for more). National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a monarch (who's portrait usually appears on the coins) dies or abdicates. This happened in Monaco and the Vatican City resulting in three new designs in circulation (the Vatican had an interim design until the new <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a> was selected). National designs have seen some changes due to new rules stating that national designs should include the name of the issuing country (Finland and Belgium both do not show their name, and hence have made minor changes).</p>
<p>As the <a href="Member_state_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">EU's membership</a> has since <a href="Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="wikilink">expanded</a> in 2004 and 2007, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins from the value of 10 cent and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map. This map showed Europe, not just the EU, as one continuous landmass, however <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a> was moved west as the map cut off after the <a href="Bosporus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bosporus</a> (which was seen as excluding <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> for political reasons). The redesign in 2007, rather than in 2004, was because 2007 saw the first enlargement of the <a href="eurozone" class="uri" title="wikilink">eurozone</a>; the entry of <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>. Hence, the Slovenian design was added to the designs in circulation. Two more designs were added in 2008 with the entry of <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Malta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malta</a> and another one in 2009 with <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><img src="EUR_0.20_edge_(2007_issue).gif" title="fig:Edge of all 20 cent coins" alt="Edge of all 20 cent coins" /> The coins are composed of an alloy called nordic gold, with a diameter of 22.25 mm, a 2.14 mm thickness and a mass of 5.74 grams. The coins' edges are smooth with seven indentations from the coin's &quot;<a href="Spanish_flower" title="wikilink">Spanish flower</a>&quot; shape. The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999 which is the year the <a href="euro" class="uri" title="wikilink">euro</a> was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-common-side">Reverse (common) side</h3>
<p>The reverse (used from 2007 onwards) was designed by Luc Luycx and displays a map of Europe on the left. The map does not include <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> and cuts off on the right through Russia (exactly, at a line from the <a href="Kandalaksha_Gulf" title="wikilink">Kandalaksha Gulf</a> to the <a href="Bosphorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bosphorus</a> (Cyprus is moved westward under <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a> in order to include it and Malta is shown as disproportionally large so that it shows up). The map is flat and level with most of the coin and the sea is shown as an indentation. Six fine lines cut through the sea, breaking when passing through the map, and at their ends at the top and bottom are twelve stars (reflective of the <a href="flag_of_Europe" title="wikilink">flag of Europe</a>). To the right, in raised lettering, is &quot;20 Euro Cent&quot; with the '20' being shown much larger than the words. The designers initials, LL, appear next to the 0 in 20.</p>
<p>Luc Luycx designed the original coin, which was much the same except the design was only of the then 15 members and shown with gaps between the states and raised rather than with an indented sea.</p>
<h3 id="obverse-national-sides">Obverse (national) sides</h3>
<p>The obverse side of the coin depends on the issuing country. All have to include twelve stars (in most cases a circle around the edge), the engravers initials and the year of issue. New designs also have to include the name or initials of the issuing country. The side cannot repeat the denomination of the coin unless the issuing country uses an alphabet other than <a href="Latin_alphabet" title="wikilink">Latin</a> (currently, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> are the only such countries, hence they engrave &quot;20 &lt;U+039B&gt;&lt;U+0395&gt;&lt;U+03A0&gt;&lt;U+03A4&gt;&lt;U+0391&gt;&quot; and &quot;20 EURO CENT&quot; upon their coins respectively).</p>

The year was lower down, also among the stars. The 2008 redesign included the letters BE (standing for Belgium) beneath the monogram, which was moved out of the stars into the centre circle but still to the right of the King's portrait. The date was also moved out and placed beneath the effigy and included two symbols either side (left: signature mark of the master of the mint, right: mint mark).</p></td>
