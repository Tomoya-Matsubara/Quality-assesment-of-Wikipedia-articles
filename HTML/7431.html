<p>For the <a href="2006_USC_Trojans_football_team" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>, Sanchez competed for the starting position; however, once junior <a href="John_David_Booty" title="wikilink">John David Booty</a> underwent back surgery after the first day of spring practice, Sanchez ran the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recuperated. Coaches stated Booty would be regarded as the starting quarterback when he returned for fall training camp.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

Mid-season, Sanchez was moved up to starting quarterback for the game against <a href="Arizona_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Arizona</a> after Booty suffered a broken finger in his throwing hand during a 24–23 upset loss to <a href="Stanford_Cardinal_football" title="wikilink">Stanford</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

The game resulted in a 24–17 defeat for USC, with Sanchez having two passes intercepted by Oregon <a href="Safety_(American_football)" title="wikilink">safety</a> Matthew Harper in the second half.

<p>When Sanchez was elevated to prominence at USC, he found himself a symbol of Mexican-American identity and a role model for children.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Being at USC put him in the center of the spotlight in Los Angeles, a metropolitan area populated with more than 4.6 million <a href="Latino" title="wikilink">Latinos</a>, three-quarters of whom are Mexican.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He began getting attention from the media in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as <a href="Jim_Plunkett" title="wikilink">Jim Plunkett</a>, <a href="Joe_Kapp" title="wikilink">Joe Kapp</a>, <a href="Jeff_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jeff Garcia</a>, and <a href="Tony_Romo" title="wikilink">Tony Romo</a>, unlike his predecessors, Sanchez was a third-generation, full-blooded Mexican-American.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> USC fans began playing up Sanchez' ethnicity by wearing items such as <a href="sarape" title="wikilink">sarapes</a>, <a href="lucha_libre" title="wikilink">lucha libre</a> masks and homemade &quot;&lt;U+00A1&gt;Viva Sanchez!&quot; T-shirts.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> His rise to fame within the Mexican-American community was compared to that of boxer <a href="Oscar_De_La_Hoya" title="wikilink">Oscar De La Hoya</a> and baseball pitcher <a href="Fernando_Valenzuela#Fernandomania" title="wikilink">Fernando Valenzuela</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>During his first two games as a starter in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom-made <a href="mouthguard" title="wikilink">mouthpiece</a> that featured the colors of the <a href="Mexican_flag" title="wikilink">Mexican flag</a> in honor of his heritage.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Although little noticed during his first game against Arizona, it became a prominent issue after his nationally-televised game against Notre Dame.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> An item that Sanchez wore because he thought it was &quot;cool&quot; became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of solidarity&lt;U+2014&gt;Sanchez publicly accepting his roots; for detractors, the gesture symbolized radical activism.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Sanchez, who was born and raised in the U.S., reportedly received letters urging him to go back to Mexico.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Sanchez himself stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s all for the best.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Surprised by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to benefit the Latino community.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Sanchez, who knew how to speak some Spanish but was not bilingual going into his junior season at USC, began taking Spanish lessons so he could do interviews with the Spanish-language media without a translator.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> He began speaking to high school kids from predominantly Mexican East Los Angeles.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The <a href="Spirit_of_Troy" title="wikilink">USC band</a> began to play &quot;<a href="El_Matador" title="wikilink">El Matador</a>&quot;, a 1993 song by <a href="Los_Fabulosos_Cadillacs" title="wikilink">Los Fabulosos Cadillacs</a>, when Sanchez would take the field.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He participated in programs which provides school supplies to first-graders in heavily Latino areas of Long Beach and the <a href="South_Bay,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">South Bay</a>, and joined L.A.
