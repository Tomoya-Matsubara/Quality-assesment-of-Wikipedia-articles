<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The building was originally constructed by the Webb Investment Company in 1922 for use as a dairy warehouse. It was built in what was known as the <a href="Denny_Regrade,_Seattle" title="wikilink">Denny Regrade</a>, named after a project to flatten Denny Hill. C. Preston Smith opened the cafe during an <a href="Great_Depression_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">economic downturn</a> in 1929. Coffee, two eggs, a ham steak, hashbrowns, and four pieces of buttered toast with jelly cost 40 cents.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Smaller dishes were 25 cents or less. A barroom was opened adjacent to the cafe upon the repeal of <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">prohibition</a> in 1933 to sell beer and wine. It became a lounge when state law allowed for the sale of <a href="hard_liquor" title="wikilink">hard liquor</a> in 1944.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith's son, Dick, took over in 1975.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Along with political activities in the neighborhood, the younger Smith was known for installing a <a href="periscope" class="uri" title="wikilink">periscope</a> over the men's room urinal to provide views of the <a href="Space_Needle" title="wikilink">Space Needle</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The 5 Point Cafe made headlines in August 2004 when radio personality <a href="Tom_Leykis" title="wikilink">Tom Leykis</a> was ejected and then assaulted outside. Leykis said his assailant kicked him in the head and knocked him to the ground. He was cut above the eye and needed 17 <a href="Surgical_suture" title="wikilink">stitches</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>There were rumors of the establishment's pending closure in September 2009.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In November 2009, it was purchased by David Meinert. He has changed little but the menu was expanded slightly with vegetarian options.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
