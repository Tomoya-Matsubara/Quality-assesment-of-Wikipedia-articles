As part of the reforms, Turkish citizens were also required to take up a last name under the <a href="Surname_Law_(Turkey)" title="wikilink">Surname Law</a> in 1934. Prior to this, Turkey's Christian and Jewish citizens were already using surnames, but Muslims did not use surnames. Muslims were generally referred by their social or professional titles such as &quot;Pasha&quot;, &quot;Hoca&quot;, &quot;Bey&quot;, &quot;Han&lt;U+0131&gt;m&quot;, &quot;Efendi&quot;, or their names were complemented with that of their father.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Mustafa Kemal himself was required to take up a surname, and the <a href="Turkish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Turkish Parliament</a> gave him the surname Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk, meaning father of the Turks.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Many members of parliament, including some of &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan's former students, suggested that Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk needed a new signature for his name. On a November morning in 1934, members of parliament presented the proposal to &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan, who accepted the task.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; That night, five model signatures were prepared and the following morning, police officers arrived to collect them.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'&lt;U+00FC&gt;n imzas&lt;U+0131&gt;n&lt;U+0131&gt;n &lt;U+00F6&gt;yk&lt;U+00FC&gt;s&lt;U+00FC&gt;&quot; /&gt; Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk personally selected the one of &quot;K.

<p>According to Hagop &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan's son Dikran &lt;U+00C7&gt;er&lt;U+00E7&gt;iyan, after the death of Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk in 1938, his father's contribution to Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk's signature risked being forgotten: &quot;Some tried to introduce others as the creator of the signature. There were efforts to forget my father. But the truth always come[s] to the surface&quot;.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master&quot; /&gt;</p>
