<h2 id="etimology">Etimology</h2>
<p>According to myths, 'Karamana' the place name came from a famous namboothiri(vaishnavite brahmin) family who lived in the bank of the river. The life of people at that time was sticking around the brahmin family. So, simply referring as the 'mana', meaning house on 'kara' meaning bank, became &quot;karamana&quot;. In the flow of time, this family extincted and still the name is there. <em>Authenticity of this data is still not confirmed.</em></p>
