The <strong>Panzerkorps <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong> was a <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="panzer" class="uri" title="wikilink">panzer</a> <a href="corps" class="uri" title="wikilink">corps</a> formed mostly of <a href="Sturmabteilung" title="wikilink">SA</a> recruits. The Panzerkorps <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> fought on the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Eastern Front</a> during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sa-standarte-feldherrnhalle---concept">SA Standarte <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> - Concept</h2>
<p>While the &lt;U+00E9&gt;lite formations of the <a href="Waffen_SS" title="wikilink">Waffen SS</a>, <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a> and <a href="German_Army" title="wikilink">Heer</a> are well studied, the formations titled <em>Feldherrnhalle</em>, although just as &lt;U+00E9&gt;lite in status and combat achievements, remain relatively unknown.</p>
<p>The <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> units were the combat formations which drew manpower from the <a href="Sturmabteilung" title="wikilink">SA</a>, tracing their history back to the days of the 1923 <a href="Beer_Hall_Putsch" title="wikilink">Beer Hall Putsch</a>. The <a href="Feldherrnhalle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Feldherrnhalle</a> was the monument in <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> where the attempted coup was crushed, and the units which bore the title were considered the &lt;U+00E9&gt;lite formations of the SA.</p>
<p>The initial unit, the <strong>SA-Standarte <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong> was formed after the death of <a href="Ernst_R&lt;U+00F6&gt;hm" title="wikilink">Ernst R&lt;U+00F6&gt;hm</a> on <a href="Night_of_the_Long_Knives" title="wikilink">Night of the Long Knives</a>, when the SA's position as the major <a href="paramilitary" class="uri" title="wikilink">paramilitary</a> formation of the <a href="NSDAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">NSDAP</a> was taken over by the <a href="Schutzstaffel" title="wikilink">SS</a>. It was made up of the most promising SA men drawn from SA units all over Germany. The Standarte was a not a combat unit, providing guard units for SA government offices, with headquarters in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> and units stationed in Berlin, <a href="Hannover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hannover</a>, <a href="Hattingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hattingen</a>, <a href="Krefeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krefeld</a>, <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a>, <a href="Ruhr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruhr</a>, <a href="Stettin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stettin</a> and <a href="Stuttgart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stuttgart</a>.</p>
<p>In March 1938, men from the Standarte were among the first units which marched into <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> during the <a href="Anschluss" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anschluss</a>. In September 1938, the <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> was placed under the control of the <a href="Wehrmacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wehrmacht</a>, and the cadre of the unit was transferred to the <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a>, forming the <strong>Luftlande-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong>, a part of the <a href="German_7th_Air_Landing_Division" title="wikilink">7.Flieger-Division</a>. The remainder of the regiment was transferred to the <a href="German_Army" title="wikilink">Heer</a>, forming the <strong>120.Infanterie-Regiment (mot)</strong> of the <a href="German_60th_Infantry_Division" title="wikilink">60.Infanterie Division (mot)</a> and <strong>271.Infanterie-Regiment</strong> of the <a href="German_93rd_Infantry_Division" title="wikilink">93.Infanterie-Division</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-campaigns">Early Campaigns</h2>
<h3 id="infanterie-division-mot">60.Infanterie-Division (mot)</h3>
<p>The cadre for the 60.Infanterie-Division came from <strong>Gruppe Eberhardt</strong> (also known as <strong>Sonderverband Danzig</strong>). The Gruppe was a unit of <a href="Ordnungspolizei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ordnungspolizei</a> and SA men, commanded by <a href="Friedrich-Georg_Eberhardt" title="wikilink">Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt</a>, and SA commander. During the <a href="Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)" title="wikilink">Invasion of Poland</a>, Gruppe Eberhardt was responsible for the <a href="Defense_of_the_Polish_Post_Office_in_Danzig" title="wikilink">capture of the Danzig Post Office</a>, defended by the Polish <a href="postal_worker" title="wikilink">postal workers</a> commanded by a reserve officer. After fierce fighting, the Polish militia retreated to the cellar, however the SA men could not capture the building. The gruppe finally defeated the Poles and secured the building by forcing the Danzig <a href="Fire_Brigade" title="wikilink">Fire Brigade</a> to flood the cellar of the building with gasoline. When the militia surrendered, they were subjected to several days of continuous torture and humiliation and then executed.</p>
<p>After the Polish campaign, Gruppe Eberhardt was dissolved and the SA men were used to form the 60.Infanterie-Division (mot), the majority of SA men joining the 120.Infanterie-Regiment (mot). The division was not ready for the campaign in the West, and formed a part of the OKH Reserve during this period, being based in <a href="Lorraine_(r&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion)" title="wikilink">Lorraine (Lothringen)</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1941, the division was moved to <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>. In April, the 60th took part in <a href="Operation_Marita" title="wikilink">Operation Marita</a>, the invasion of the Balkans and Greece. The SA formation acquitted itself well in the fighting in <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, and at the end of the campaign was moved back into Romania to join <a href="Army_Group_South" title="wikilink">Army Group South</a>, which was preparing for <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a>. On June 1941, the division crossed the Soviet border and began the advance towards <a href="Crimea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimea</a> and eventually <a href="Rostov_on_Don" title="wikilink">Rostov on Don</a>. During the <a href="blitzkrieg" class="uri" title="wikilink">blitzkrieg</a> campaign, the division again performed superbly, advancing as a part of <a href="German_First_Panzer_Army" title="wikilink">Panzergruppe 1</a>. By the end of the campaign, the division had taken part in the capture of Rostov-on-Don before the Army Group was ordered to abandon the city and form defensive lines for the winter. Over the winter of 1941-1942 the division managed to hold its position despite terrible conditions and ceaseless Soviet counterattacks.</p>
<p>In 1942, the division took part in <a href="Fall_Blau" title="wikilink">Fall Blau</a>, the advance through the <a href="Don_Basin" title="wikilink">Don Basin</a> towards <a href="Stalingrad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stalingrad</a>. As a part of <em>Generaloberst</em> <a href="Friedrich_Paulus" title="wikilink">Paulus'</a> <a href="German_Sixth_Army" title="wikilink">6.Armee</a>, the division was involved in heavy fighting during the <a href="Battle_of_Stalingrad" title="wikilink">Battle of Stalingrad</a>. When Soviet offensives encircled Paulus' Army, the division continued resisting the Soviets until the final collapse of the German defence in February 1943.</p>
<p>The remnants of the division which had been on leave or convalescing were ordered to the south of France to begin reforming the division, to be upgraded as a <a href="panzergrenadier" class="uri" title="wikilink">panzergrenadier</a> division and redesignated <strong>60.Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="infanterie-regiment">271.Infanterie-Regiment</h3>
<p>The 271st Regiment fought with distinction during the <a href="Battle_of_France" title="wikilink">Battle of France</a>, taking part in the assaults on the <a href="Maginot_Line" title="wikilink">Maginot Line</a> and advancing south, crossing the <a href="Seille" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seille</a> River and the <a href="Meurthe_River" title="wikilink">Meurthe River</a> in <a href="Alsace-Lorraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alsace-Lorraine</a>. The regiment ended the campaign on the <a href="Moselle_River" title="wikilink">Moselle River</a> between <a href="Nancy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nancy</a> and <a href="Epinal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epinal</a>, advancing south where it ended near the region of the River Moselle between Nancy and Epinal on June 25th, 1940. The 93.Infanterie was stationed on the French Coast after the capitulation of France.</p>
<p>In March 1941, the regiment, along with the rest of the 93.Infanterie, was ordered to the East to take part in <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a>. The division was to form a part of <a href="Army_Group_North" title="wikilink">Army Group North</a>, tasked with advancing on <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Leningrad</a>. After the launch of the offensive on 22 June 1941, the regiment distinguished itself in heavy fighting during the advance. At the end of the campaign, the division was stationed near Leningrad, and over the winter of 1941-1942 saw heavy fighting against fierce <a href="Soviet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> counterattacks.</p>
<p>The division remained in combat near Leningrad throughout 1942. In August, the regiment was granted the title <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> in honour of the outstanding performance it had shown during the battles in France and Russia. The regiment was redesignated <strong>271.Grenadier-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong>. The regiment remained in action on the Northern front, fighting at the siege of <a href="Cholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cholm</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_Velikiye_Luki" title="wikilink">Battle of Velikiye Luki</a>. In the summer of 1943, the <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> regiment was withdrawn from the division and sent back to Southern France to form join the remnants of the 120.Infanterie-Regiment (mot) which were in the process of reforming the 60.Infanterie-Division (mot) as the <strong>60.Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="vitebsk---narva---byelorussia">Vitebsk - Narva - Byelorussia</h2>
<p>The new division spent the rest of the year forming and training in Southern France. In November, all the divisional units had their numbers removed and were granted the title <em>Feldherrnhalle</em>. The 271.Grenaider-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> formed the Grenadier-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> and the reformed 120.Grenadier-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> became F&lt;U+00FC&gt;silier-Regiment <em>Feldherrnhalle</em>. In December, the division was ordered back to the eastern front, to join the <a href="German_Third_Panzer_Army" title="wikilink">3.Panzer-Armee</a> which was involved in heavy fighting near <a href="Vitebsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitebsk</a> in <a href="Byelorussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byelorussia</a>. Arriving in early January 1944, the division fought exceptionally during the fierce battles around the city.</p>
<p>After executing a fighting withdrawal through Byelorussia, the division was transferred to the <a href="Narva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narva</a> front, where SS-Obergruppenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer <a href="Felix_Steiner" title="wikilink">Steiner's</a> <a href="III_(Germanic)_SS_Panzer_Corps" title="wikilink">III.(gemanisches) SS-Panzerkorps</a> was involved in heavy fighting for the bridgehead over the <a href="Narva_river" title="wikilink">Narva river</a>. The division remained in combat on the Narva front, distinguishing itself in what would be known as the <a href="Battle_of_Narva_(1944)" title="wikilink">Battle of the European SS</a>.</p>
<p>In May, the division was ordered south to bolster the forces of <a href="Army_Group_Centre" title="wikilink">Army Group Centre</a>, engaged near <a href="Mogilev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mogilev</a> and <a href="Orscha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orscha</a>. With the launch of the Soviet <a href="Operation_Bagration" title="wikilink">Operation Bagration</a> in June 1944, the division was pushed back towards <a href="Minsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minsk</a>, where it was encircled. In late July, after heavy resistance and several failed breakout attempts, the division was annihilated near the city.</p>
<h2 id="reformation---debrecen---hungary">Reformation - Debrecen - Hungary</h2>
<p>Again, all members of the division who had been absent were ordered to begin reforming, this time near <a href="Warthelager" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warthelager</a>. The reforming began in September, 1944. Concurrently, the formation of several new <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> formations began.</p>
<h3 id="panzer-brigade-feldherrnhalle">106.Panzer-Brigade <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></h3>
<p>The 106.Panzer-Brigade <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> was formed from a cadre of SA men. The 106th boasted a strong consignment of the latest <a href="Panther_tank" title="wikilink">Panther ausf G</a> tanks, a fully mechanised Panzergrenadier battalion and a company of the brand new <a href="Jagdpanzer_IV" title="wikilink">Jagdpanzer IV/70s</a>. The brigade was sent into action in Alsace-Lorraine against the American forces of General <a href="George_Patton" title="wikilink">Patton's</a> <a href="US_Third_Army" title="wikilink">US Third Army</a>. The 106th fought well during the withdrawal into Germany. On 6 April 1945, the remnants of the brigade were assigned to the ad-hoc <a href="German_Panzer_Division_Clauswitz" title="wikilink">Panzer-Division <em>Clauswitz</em></a>. The brigade's survivors surrendered to the Americans on 8 May, 1945.</p>
<h3 id="panzer-brigade-feldherrnhalle-1">110.Panzer-Brigade <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></h3>
<p>The 110.Panzer-Brigade <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> was the second <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> panzer brigade. Formed from a cadre of SA men, the 110th was strongly equipped with a battalion of Panthers and a battalion of mechanised infantry. The 110th was sent to Romania, where it supported the forces of <a href="Army_Group_South" title="wikilink">Army Group South Ukraine</a> during the withdrawal into Hungary. The brigade, along with the reformed Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> took part in the <a href="Battle_of_Debrecen" title="wikilink">Battle of Debrecen</a> in October 1944, acquitting itself well. During these battles, the 110th fought alongside the <a href="German_13th_Panzer_Division" title="wikilink">13.Panzer-Division</a>. In November 1944, the brigade was disbanded and absorbed into the 13.Panzer. As a result, the 13.Panzer was renamed <strong>13.Panzer-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></strong>.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="panzergrenadier-division-feldherrnhalle">Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></h3>
<p>The Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> was only partially formed by September 1944, when it was ordered to the Front in Hungary to strengthen <a href="German_Sixth_Army" title="wikilink">Armeegruppe <em>Fretter-Pico</em></a>, which was threatening to collapse in the face of a major soviet offensive near <a href="Oradea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oradea</a> and Debrecen. The division, only the size of a brigade, was committed to battle in mid October, ordered to hold a major crossing point on the <a href="Tisza_River" title="wikilink">Tisza River</a>. When the Soviet spearhead threatened to encircle several panzer divisions near Debrecen, the division was thrown into battle in an ultimately successful attempt to cut off and annihilate the Soviet units. During the following battle, the division fought alongside both the 13.Panzer-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> and <a href="German_503rd_Heavy_Panzer_Detachment" title="wikilink">schwere-Panzer-Abteilung 503</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>After enjoying major success of the <a href="Battle_of_Debrecen" title="wikilink">Battle of Debrecen</a>, the division fought in co-operation with schwere-Panzer-Abteilung 503 and was soon involved in the withdrawal towards <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>. The Panzergrenadier Division, sPzAbt 503 and the 13.Panzer <em>Feldherrnhalle</em>, by now exhausted and dangerously understrength, were pushed back into the city. On 21 December 1944, the sPzAbt 503 was renamed schwere-Panzer-Abteilung <em>Feldherrnhalle</em>.</p>
<p>On December 31, the three formations were encircled along with <a href="9th_SS_Mountain_Corps" title="wikilink">IX.SS-Gebirgskorps</a>. For the next month, the <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> units desperately held out for rescue. After the failure of <a href="Operation_Konrad" title="wikilink">Operation Konrad</a>, Armeegruppe <em>Balck's</em> rescue attempts, the pocket collapsed and the divisions were destroyed on 12 February, 1945. Among those to escape the pocket was a group of several hundred <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> men.</p>
<h2 id="panzerkorps-feldherrnhalle">Panzerkorps <em>Feldherrnhalle</em></h2>
<p>After the annihilation of three <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> units in Budapest, plans were made to not only reform the three units, but also for the creation of a Panzer Corps, along the lines of the <a href="Grossdeutschland_Division" title="wikilink">Panzerkorps <em>Gro&lt;U+00DF&gt;deutschland</em></a> or the <a href="Hermann_G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ring_Division" title="wikilink">Fallschirm-Panzerkorps <em>Hermann G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>The survivors of the encirclement, along with large numbers of new SA recruits, were formed into three new units. The remnants of the Panzergrenadier-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> became <strong>Panzer-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle 1</em></strong>. Although not a full strength division, the unit was equipped with the latest equipment and well trained.</p>
<p>The 13.Panzer-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> became <strong>Panzer-Division <em>Feldherrnhalle 2</em></strong>. This division was virtually identical to the <em>Feldherrnhalle 1</em>. It was commanded by the ace panzer commander <em>Generalmajor</em> Dr. <a href="Franz_B&lt;U+00E4&gt;ke" title="wikilink">Franz B&lt;U+00E4&gt;ke</a>.</p>
<p>The remnants of the sPzAbt <em>Feldherrnhalle</em> were reformed, although the detachment never reached its former strength.</p>
<p>The corps was activated at the end of February, with most of the combat units being sent into action at the end of March 1945. The Panzerkorps executed a fighting withdrawal towards <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> and then into southern <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>. Over the last months of the war, the corps saw heavy fighting and acquitted itself well. By the beginning of May 1945, the shattered remnants of the corps broke up and attempted to reach the American lines, where they surrendered on 9 May 1945.</p>
