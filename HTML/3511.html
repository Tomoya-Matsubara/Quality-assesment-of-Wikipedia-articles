<p><img src="The_road_to_Lincoln_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1152235.jpg" title="fig:Approach to Lincoln at North Greetwell" alt="Approach to Lincoln at North Greetwell" width="140" /> The road begins outside Lincoln as part of the by-pass at the <a href="A46_road" title="wikilink">A46</a>  roundabout with <em>Nettleham Road</em> (B1182). The road does not enter the borough of Lincoln, and begins in the parish of <a href="Nettleham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nettleham</a> in <a href="West_Lindsey" title="wikilink">West Lindsey</a>. Before the Lincoln Bypass was built (in stages) in the mid-1980s, the A158 historically went along <em>Wragby Road</em> (now the A15). Even earlier the A158 followed the northern end of <em>Canwick Road</em>, the former B1188, over Pelham Bridge since its opening in 1958, and along <em>South Park Avenue</em> which was also built in 1958, to meet the former A46 at <a href="St._Catherines,_Lincoln" title="wikilink">St Catherine's</a>. This was parallel to the former western section B1190. The A15 at the time followed the west of Lincoln town centre, then along <em>Silver Street</em>.</p>
<p>It heads south east for  until reaching a roundabout where the <a href="A15_road_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">A15</a> joins from the centre of Lincoln. From here the route heads north-east <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668659">through</a> the village of <a href="North_Greetwell" title="wikilink">North Greetwell</a> along a former <a href="Roman_road" title="wikilink">Roman road</a>, where it is the parish boundary between <a href="Nettleham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nettleham</a> to the north and <a href="Greetwell,_West_Lindsey" title="wikilink">Greetwell</a> to the south, Nettleham and <a href="Reepham,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Reepham</a>, then <a href="Sudbrooke" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudbrooke</a> and Reepham. It passes Sudbrooke to the south, where there is a <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668667">crossroads</a>, with the main road for Sudbrooke to the left, and <a href="Star_Energy" title="wikilink">Star Energy</a>'s <a href="Welton,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Welton</a> Gathering Centre (in Reepham) for the Welton oilfield (part of the <a href="East_Midlands_Oil_Province" title="wikilink">East Midlands Oil Province</a>). The Cherry Tree Cafe is at the <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1152043">junction</a>. It passes to the south of Sudbrooke Park (a Scout camp site), and <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2490373">crosses</a> the Lincoln to <a href="Grimsby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grimsby</a> railway in the parish of <a href="Barlings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barlings</a>, next to the <em>Oriental Express Restaurant</em> (former <em><a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/421180">Station Inn</a></em>). At <a href="Langworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Langworth</a> there is a crossroads for <a href="Scothern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scothern</a>, to the left, and Barlings, to the right, and passes St Hugh's <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/93727">church</a> and the <em><a href="http://www.the-george-inn.co.uk">George Inn</a></em>. It crosses the <a href="Barlings_Eau" title="wikilink">Barlings Eau</a> at Langworth Bridge and there is a left turn for <a href="Stainton_by_Langworth" title="wikilink">Stainton by Langworth</a>, and a right turn for <a href="Newball" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newball</a>, and the <a href="Woodside_Wildlife_and_Falconry_Park" title="wikilink">Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Further on in the parish of Stainton by Langworth, near <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/329930">Rand Wood</a>, the B1399 heads north-east while the A158 changes direction and heads east to <a href="Wragby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wragby</a>. In <a href="Bullington,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Bullington</a> it passes <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/329961">Bullington Hall</a> and in <a href="Rand,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Rand</a>, it passes Brown Cow Farm, and there is a left <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668677">turn</a> for Rand and <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2511568">Rand Farm Park</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The <a href="Rand_Group" title="wikilink">Rand Group</a> construction company was <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330001">based</a> there until October 2009 when it went into administration. It is briefly the parish boundary between Rand, to the north, and <a href="Goltho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goltho</a>, to the south, and <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330027">passes</a> Goltho Gardens,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with a teashop. Approaching Wragby it enters <a href="East_Lindsey" title="wikilink">East Lindsey</a>. Here it <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2668679">crosses</a> the B1202 at traffic lights near the <em><a href="http://www.turnorarmswragby.co.uk">Turnor Arms</a></em> then forks with the <a href="A157_road" title="wikilink">A157</a> which heads through the <a href="Lincolnshire_Wolds" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire Wolds</a> to <a href="Louth,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Louth</a>. The A157 formerly followed the A158's current route to Lincoln, and the A158's western terminus was at Wragby before the 1940s. It passes the parish church of All Saints, and crosses the former <a href="Louth_to_Bardney_Line" title="wikilink">Louth to Bardney Line</a>. From here the route gets quite twisty then heads south east around the south end of the Wolds. It crosses Stainfield Back at <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/330131">Langton Bridge</a>, and passes through <a href="Langton_by_Wragby" title="wikilink">Langton by Wragby</a>, where there is a left turn on a bend for <a href="Panton,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Panton</a>, then a right turn on a bend for Chambers Farm Wood,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> part of the <a href="Lincolnshire_Limewoods" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire Limewoods</a> nature reserve.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> At <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/390505">Hatton Bridge</a>, it is the parish boundary between Langton by Wragby, to the west and <a href="Hatton,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Hatton</a>, to the east.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2534096">crossroads</a> for Hatton, to the left, and another crossroads at the (unoccupied) <em><a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/390517">New Midge Inn</a></em>, where the road becomes the parish boundary with <a href="Minting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minting</a> to the south. At <a href="Baumber" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baumber</a> the B1225 joins from the north as the A158 continues towards in a more southerly direction towards the town of <a href="Horncastle,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Horncastle</a>. The B1190 and B1191 both join just outside Horncastle where the road crosses the <a href="A153_road" title="wikilink">A153</a>.</p>

<p><img src="The_George_and_Dragon,_Hagworthingham_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1316704.jpg" title="fig:The A158 in Hagworthingham" alt="The A158 in Hagworthingham" /> After leaving Horncastle the route heads east with the B1195 heading off  later to <a href="Spilsby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spilsby</a>. Further on the road passes through the village of Hagworthingham. The road then reaches a roundabout with the <a href="A16_road_(England)" title="wikilink">A16</a> at <a href="Partney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Partney</a>. Both roads used to go through Partney but now bypass it. The construction of this bypass was preceded by a significant archaeological investigation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>The A158 continues east until reaching another roundabout with the <a href="A1028_road" title="wikilink">A1028</a> which provides a short cut from the A16 further north. The B1196 also heads up to <a href="Alford,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Alford</a> from here. The A158 becomes dual-carriageway for  from here until becoming single again through Gunby. The road then joins with the newly opened <a href="Burgh_Bypass" title="wikilink">Burgh Bypass</a>, before finally reaching Skegness where it terminates at a junction with the <a href="A52_road" title="wikilink">A52</a> </p>
