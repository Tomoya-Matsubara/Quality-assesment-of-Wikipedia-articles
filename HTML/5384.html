<p>The <strong>Sign of the Cross</strong> is a ceremonial hand motion made by the vast majority of the world's Christians. It is usually accompanied with the <a href="trinitarian_formula" title="wikilink">trinitarian formula</a>. For Christians, the motion symbolizes the <a href="Christian_cross" title="wikilink">Cross</a> on <a href="Calvary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calvary</a> by tracing the shape of the cross in the air or on one's own body. The four points can also signify loving God with all one's heart, soul, mind and strength. There are two particular arrangements one is most likely to observe. One is followed by many of the <a href="Eastern_Churches" title="wikilink">Eastern Churches</a>, the other by the <a href="Western_Christianity" title="wikilink">Western Churches</a> (<a href="Anglicanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglicanism</a>, <a href="Lutheranism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheranism</a>, and <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a>) as well as the <a href="Oriental_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Oriental Orthodox</a>. Many professional athletes respect the sign of the cross and can often be seen doing it.</p>

<p>Typically, the right hand is used. The thumb, index, and middle finger are brought to a point. They are then placed on the forehead, then moved down to the sternum, and then from one shoulder to the other (for differences on the sequence see below).</p>
<p>As one moves through the Sign, one recites the <a href="Trinitarian_formula" title="wikilink">Trinitarian formula</a>: at the forehead, &quot;In the name of the Father&quot;; at the stomach, &quot;and of the Son&quot;; across the shoulders, &quot;and of the <a href="Holy_Spirit" title="wikilink">Holy Spirit</a>/Ghost&quot;; and in the end, &quot;Amen.&quot; There are several interpretations, according to <a href="Church_Fathers" title="wikilink">Church Fathers</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>: the forehead symbolizes the Heaven; the stomach, the Earth; the shoulders, the place and sign of power. Also, the hand to the forehead may be seen as a prayer to the Father for wisdom; the hand to the stomach as a prayer to the Son who become <a href="Incarnation_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">incarnate</a>; and the hand to the shoulders as a prayer to the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The thumb, index and middle finger brought to a point symbolize the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a>, three persons sharing a single essence. The remaining two fingers are kept pressed close together and to the palm, representing the human and divine natures united together in Jesus Christ. For the Eastern Orthodox<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the ring and little fingers symbolize <a href="Adam_and_Eve" title="wikilink">Adam and Eve</a> <a href="kneeling" class="uri" title="wikilink">kneeling</a> in front of the Trinity.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are variations that occur. For example, in practice some may mark a very large cross, or a very small one, although some churches teach a proper way to make the sign of cross. A person may reach for <a href="holy_water" title="wikilink">holy water</a> first. After moving the hand from one shoulder to the other, it may return to the stomach. It may be accompanied instead at times with the words of the <a href="Jesus_Prayer" title="wikilink">Jesus Prayer</a> in some form, or simply &quot;<a href="Kyrie" title="wikilink">Lord have mercy</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one may make the sign of the cross using the tongue (top, bottom, left-right/right-left), especially in circumstances where it may be considered inappropriate, or as a means to hide the gesture from the others, or to keep its personal character instead of showing it to the others.</p>

<p>In <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> until the reforms of <a href="Patriarch_Nikon" title="wikilink">Patriarch Nikon</a> in the <a href="17th_century" title="wikilink">17th century</a>, it was customary to make the sign of the cross with two fingers (symbolising the dual nature of Christ). The enforcement of the three-finger sign was one of the reasons for the <a href="Schism_(religion)" title="wikilink">schism</a> with the <a href="Old_Believers" title="wikilink">Old Believers</a> whose congregations continue to use the two-finger sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Today <a href="Russian_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Russian Orthodox</a> believers finish the sign of the cross by moving the hand to the left side, below the stomach, as opposed to the shoulder. They also frequently make the Sign two times in a row and then bow toward the <a href="church" class="uri" title="wikilink">church</a>, <a href="icon" class="uri" title="wikilink">icon</a>, <a href="cross" class="uri" title="wikilink">cross</a>, or <a href="priest" class="uri" title="wikilink">priest</a>.</p>
<h3 id="shoulders-succession">Shoulders' succession</h3>
<p>Regarding the sequence of which shoulder is touched first, different practices have developed: Catholics of the Latin Rite, Anglicans, Lutherans and the Oriental Orthodox will move the hand from the left shoulder to the right, while the Eastern Orthodox and most Eastern Catholics will do the opposite (i.e. right, then left).</p>
<p>In the western Church, the direction gradually changed during the first millennium from right-to-left to left-to-right. The reasons for this are unclear and heavily disputed, however, the most accepted is that in the West, when the priest made the Sign over the people to bless them, the people mirrored the direction of his hand, rather than copying the motions, thus, they moved their hand left-to-right, the direction that the priest's hand moved from the point of view of the congregation. In the <a href="Byzantine-Rite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine-Rite</a> East, the people simply continued to make the same sign. The Ethiopians, though further removed from the West, make the sign of the cross left-to-right.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, by the 13th century, after the Great Schism between East and West had already occurred, Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) who met with Saint Francis of Assisi, directed that the Sign of the Cross be made with three fingers pressed together, two fingers held tightly in the palm and the hand moves from the forehead to the belly and from the right side to the left shoulder. He also acknowledged that some (in the far West) did the sign with two fingers and from left to right &lt;U+2013&gt; this was not correct.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-the-sign">Use of the sign</h2>
<p>There are certain times when Christians will make the Sign. Throughout every liturgical action, such as the <a href="Mass_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">Mass</a>, there are moments where the Sign is called for. The rubrics of the <a href="Tridentine_Mass" title="wikilink">Tridentine Mass</a> called for it to be made many times over the already consecrated bread and wine. In Eastern Orthodox prayers, the sign of the cross is usually made whenever all three persons of the Trinity are addressed, or alluded to, which is the same in Independent Anglicanism. If one prays the <a href="Breviary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Breviary</a>, one will make the Sign at various times. Before commencing any prayer, in fact, the Sign is typically made. Upon entering a church, and the sanctuary within the church, one will make the Sign partly as an outward sign of reverence and <a href="veneration" class="uri" title="wikilink">veneration</a>.</p>
<p>Eastern Orthodox and Catholics will make the Sign as one way of venerating an <a href="icon" class="uri" title="wikilink">icon</a> of any saint, as well as when venerating the Cross or other sacred relics and objects. It is also often used as a gesture of associating oneself particularly with a petition bring prayed for or when a favourite saint is mentioned in prayers. Anglicans will make it while kneeling, before they sit down in the pew. <a href="Priest" title="wikilink">Priests</a> have many more specific occasions upon which to make the Sign. In the <a href="Lutheranism" title="wikilink">Lutheran tradition</a> the pastor will often make the sign to accompany the &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit&quot; parts of liturgy, and congregation members are free to join in. Some other <a href="Protestantism" title="wikilink">protestant</a> denominations use the sign less, or in some cases not at all.</p>
<p>Many Christians will make the Sign in a way that may seem idiomatic to some: for example, if one is exposed to blasphemy, he or she may make the Sign, partly to suggest subtly and politely to the speaker that an offense has been committed, partly to ask the Trinity to forgive the offender. Some will use the Sign in what seems to be a <a href="charm" title="wikilink">wish for luck</a>; it may be that, or a part of an unsaid prayer for God's blessing, as when starting a travel, a sport competition or a <a href="bullfight" class="uri" title="wikilink">bullfight</a>. The Anglican and Catholic Churches (both Roman and Eastern) consider the Sign a <a href="sacramentals" title="wikilink">sacramental</a>. Christians may also make the Sign when passing a church as recognition and adoration of Christ's presence in the Eucharist.</p>
<p>The Sign of the Cross is made in other ways as well: it can be made in the air to bless objects (usually by a priest) and it may trace a very small trajectory, such as on the forehead. Before listening to the <a href="Gospel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gospel</a> during Mass, Roman Catholics, as well as a great many Anglicans, trace the sign with the thumb of the right hand on their own forehead, on their lips and on the heart in quick succession. (Traditionally Roman Catholics will also say 'May the Word of God be on my mind, on my lips and in my heart' when signing the respective areas.)</p>
<p>For Christians in general, perhaps the essential element of the Sign is that it physically indicates the direct relevance of the Cross, of the Sacrifice of <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>, to one's person or surroundings. It is an engagement of the body that affirms what the faithful professes. It is also a sign to others of what one professes. Many do not hesitate to cross-sign themselves in public as they feel that this an outward expression of their faith to others.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Bishops, including the Pope make the Sign of the Cross with their right hand three times when they are blessing the public, such as at the end of the Mass. It is made once at the Name of the Father, a second time at naming the Son and one last time at the naming of the Holy Spirit. Other Roman Catholic clerics, however, are restricted to making the Sign of the Cross only once.</p>
<p>In traditional societies, the sign of the cross is performed in food making, eg. the <a href="spoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">spoon</a> crosses the newly poured mixture before stirring it, in order to bless the food that will come out, <a href="housewives" class="uri" title="wikilink">housewives</a> make the cross with their hand for the food when putting it in the <a href="oven" class="uri" title="wikilink">oven</a> etc. Actually, the custom is followed generally with any product coming from traditional workshops, eg. <a href="pottery" class="uri" title="wikilink">pottery</a> etc. As an extension, on the eating table, the <a href="paterfamilias" class="uri" title="wikilink">paterfamilias</a> crosses the <a href="bread" class="uri" title="wikilink">bread</a> with the knife before cutting it into slices, since bread is parallelled with the body of <a href="Christ" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christ</a>.</p>
<h2 id="low-church-attitudes">Low-Church attitudes</h2>
<p>Although the Sign of the Cross dates to early Christianity, it was generally rejected by the Reformers, and is mostly absent from <a href="Protestantism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestantism</a>. Since the <a href="Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reformation</a>, it has generally been rejected by Protestants in general and some <a href="Low_church" title="wikilink">Low-Church</a> Anglicans as being a Catholic practice.</p>
<h3 id="lutheranism">Lutheranism</h3>
<p>Many <a href="Lutherans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutherans</a> never abandoned the practice. In the <a href="Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America" title="wikilink">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>, for example, it is expected before the morning &amp; evening prayers in the catechism.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="methodism">Methodism</h3>
<p>Since <a href="The_United_Methodist_Church" title="wikilink">The United Methodist Church</a> is, generally speaking, a product of the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>, it has a <a href="piety" class="uri" title="wikilink">piety</a> that tends to be <a href="iconoclastic" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconoclastic</a>--that is rejecting statues, icons, and many other Romish practices.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Currently, the sign of the cross is used by a small portion of Methodists on a regular basis, but on <a href="Ash_Wednesday" title="wikilink">Ash Wednesday</a>, it is almost always applied by the <a href="Elder_(Methodism)" title="wikilink">elder</a> on the <a href="laity" class="uri" title="wikilink">laity</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, the usage of the sign of the cross is predicted to become more accepted in the near future, due to the <a href="ecumenical_movement" title="wikilink">ecumenical movement</a>, and a greater understanding of the <a href="sacrament" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacrament</a> of <a href="Baptism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptism</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origins-of-the-sign-of-the-cross">Origins of the sign of the cross</h2>
<p>The Christian custom of gesturing the sign of the cross was originally with the right hand's thumb only and across the forehead only. (St. John Chrys., Hom. ad pop. Antioch. xi; St. Jerome, Ep. ad Eustochium.) The custom originated during the second century.</p>
<p>Vestiges of this earliest gesture still exist when Christians sign a cross on their forehead to hear the Gospels during mass, when their foreheads are marked with ash on <a href="Ash_Wednesday" title="wikilink">Ash Wednesday</a>, when applying the holy oil (called <a href="chrism" class="uri" title="wikilink">chrism</a>) on the forehead for the <a href="sacrament" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacrament</a> of <a href="Confirmation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confirmation</a>, and so on. Around year 200 in <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a> (modern Tunisia, Africa), <a href="Tertullian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tertullian</a> says: &quot;We Christians wear out our foreheads with the sign of the cross&quot; () (De Cor. mil. 3). The second century Christians signed the cross on their forehead before taking any risk, such as embarking on a journey, and so on.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Tertullian points out that the sign of the cross is not commanded in any Holy Scripture. It is only from Christian cultural tradition. A search for a scriptual prooftext for the sign of the cross has required loose interpretations. For examples: &quot;Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark [of ash?] on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it&quot; (). &quot;Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.&quot; (). And so on. Of course, none of these biblical prooftexts prescribe a motion of a cross, but their location on the forehead probably informed the early Christian custom.</p>
<p>By the fourth century, the sign of the cross involved other parts of the body beyond the forehead. (St. <a href="Ambrose" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ambrose</a>, De Isaac et anim&lt;U+00E2&gt;, Migne, P. L., XIV, 501-34.) By the sixth century, these variations of smaller signs across the body conflated into one larger sign from forehead to sternum, like the Orthodox Christians use now. At this time, the signing of the larger cross was also choreographed with three fingers (including the thumb) to represent the Trinity and with the phrase in .</p>
<p>Originally, when signing the large sign of the cross on oneself, the movement of the hand was from right-to-left. The Eastern Orthodox Church still preserves this motion today. However, the Western Roman Church soon reversed the direction. This relatively minor difference was mentioned as a factor in the <a href="Great_Schism" title="wikilink">Great Schism</a> between the Orthodox and Catholic Christians in the eleventh century.</p>
<h2 id="double-cross">Double-cross</h2>
<p>The English-language expression &quot;double-cross&quot; has led to some <a href="fake_etymology" title="wikilink">fake etymology</a>: the fact that the sign is made in one direction in the Western rite, and the other in the Eastern rites, leads to its sometimes informal use for two people to identify themselves and others as being from the West or East. There was a period in the Middle Ages when some Venetian merchants and others would cross themselves in the Western fashion when meeting with Westerners, and in the Eastern fashion when meeting with Easterners. This duplicity supposedly led to the coining of the phrase &quot;double crosser&quot; to mean someone who professes to be aligned with one party, but in reality is aligned with an opposing party or with no party.</p>
<p>The actual origin of the expression &quot;double-cross&quot; which dates in English from only <a href="1834" class="uri" title="wikilink">1834</a>, has to do with &quot;fixing&quot; a horse-race in a pre-arranged swindle that is almost certainly unconnected with the sign of the cross.</p>
<h2 id="pop-culture-references">Pop-culture References</h2>
<p>The order of motions for the sign of the cross is sometimes referred to by the catchphrase <em>Spectacles, Testicles, Watch and Wallet</em> — the watch being a <a href="pocket_watch" title="wikilink">pocket watch</a> which is traditionally worn in the left hand chest pocket.</p>
<p>It was the punchline in a joke told by <a href="Myron_Cohen" title="wikilink">Myron Cohen</a> on <a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="wikilink">The Ed Sullivan Show</a> and <a href="The_Tonight_Show" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show</a> in the 1960s, in which a Catholic priest and his good friend the Rabbi, whom he had long been teasing about needing to convert to Catholicism, are on an airplane together when the plane hits an air pocket and jumps violently. The rabbi makes the traditional gesture and the priest cries out, &quot;You've converted!&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the rabbi, &quot;I vas just checking: spectacles, testicles, vatch, and vallet.&quot;</p>
<p>This term is used in the <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a> <a href="Jonathan_Lynn" title="wikilink">Jonathan Lynn</a> film <a href="Nuns_on_the_Run" title="wikilink">Nuns on the Run</a> when lapsed <a href="Catholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> Charlie (<a href="Robbie_Coltrane" title="wikilink">Robbie Coltrane</a>) tries to teach Brian (<a href="Eric_Idle" title="wikilink">Eric Idle</a>) how to perform the sign of the cross, so that he can successfully pass himself off as a <a href="nun" class="uri" title="wikilink">nun</a>. It is also used by <a href="Edward_Norton" title="wikilink">Edward Norton</a> in <a href="Keeping_the_Faith" title="wikilink">Keeping the Faith</a> where, as a priest, he unsuccessfully tries to teach <a href="Ben_Stiller" title="wikilink">Ben Stiller</a>, a rabbi, how to sign the cross.</p>
