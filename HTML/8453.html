<p><strong>Jostein Flo</strong> (born <a href="October_3" title="wikilink">October 3</a>, <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a> in <a href="Stryn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stryn</a>) is a former <a href="Norway" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football (soccer)</a> player, famous for his physical playing style and aerial dominance. At club level he usually played centre-forward. For the national team he played right winger, and he was instrumental for the tactics applied by former Norway coach <a href="Egil_Olsen" title="wikilink">Egil Olsen</a>. Playing a characteristic 4-5-1 formation, the left back would often hit long crosses to Flo, who in turn would head the ball to either one of the central midfielders or to the striker. This was known as the &quot;Flo pass&quot;, and the Norwegian national team garnered much criticism for its perceived long-ball approach. Egil Olsen did, however, take the national team to two World Cups, and the long ball style of play is considered to have played an important role in accomplishing this. </p>
<p>He played for Stryn, <a href="Sogndal_I.L." title="wikilink">Sogndal I.L.</a>, <a href="Molde_F.K." title="wikilink">Molde F.K.</a>, <a href="Lierse_S.K." title="wikilink">Lierse S.K.</a>, <a href="Sheffield_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield United F.C.</a> and <a href="Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset_I.F." title="wikilink">Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset I.F.</a>. He was <a href="cap_(football)" title="wikilink">capped</a> 53 times, and scored 11 goals for the <a href="Norway_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Norwegian national team</a> and was part of his country's squads at the <a href="Football_World_Cup_1994" title="wikilink">1994</a> and <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1998 FIFA World Cups</a>. Perhaps his most famous appearance for the national side was the World Cup match against Brazil on June 23 1998, when he came on as a late substitute and contributed heavily to turning a 0-1 deficit to a last-gasp 2-1 upset of the reigning World Cup champions.</p>
<p>Flo retired after the 2002 season, having scored 120 goals in 184 games for Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset. After his playing career, he worked with marketing for the club before he filled the role of excecutive director from October, 2004 to January, 2006. Flo is currently the director of football of Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset.</p>
<p>He is the older brother of <a href="Tore_Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Flo" title="wikilink">Tore Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Flo</a> (who played for <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="wikilink">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Rangers_F.C." title="wikilink">Rangers</a> amongst other clubs) and <a href="Jarle_Flo" title="wikilink">Jarle Flo</a>, also a former professional footballer. <a href="H&lt;U+00E5&gt;vard_Flo" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00E5&gt;vard Flo</a> is his cousin. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
