<p><strong>Edward Nathan George, Jr.</strong> (born September 24, 1973) is a former <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> <a href="running_back" title="wikilink">running back</a> in the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>. He played for the <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a> both in Tennessee and in Houston when the franchise was known as the Houston Oilers, and spent his final season with the <a href="Dallas_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a>. He is best known for his career with the Titans and as a <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> winner at <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State University</a> in 1995.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>George was born in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>. He attended <a href="Abington_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Abington Senior High School</a> until the 10th grade. Soon he transferred to <a href="Fork_Union_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">Fork Union Military Academy</a>. George made the decision to stay at Fork Union Military Academy for a fifth prep school year. Such choices are commonly made by high school football players hoping to improve their recruitment status with colleges, but for George it meant another year of vigorous military lifestyle. George went on to rush for 1,372 yards in his fifth season at FUMA, attracting the attention of several major colleges. He went on to attend college at <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State University</a>.</p>
<h2 id="college-career">College career</h2>
<p>As a freshman running back for the Buckeyes, George was an instant contributor. He scored 3 rushing touchdowns in a win over <a href="Syracuse_University" title="wikilink">Syracuse University</a>. However, he suffered a major setback in a game against the <a href="University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" title="wikilink">University of Illinois</a>. In that game, George lost a fumble at the Illinois' 4-yard line that was returned 96 yards for a touchdown. Later in the game, with Ohio State leading by 2 points in the final quarter, George fumbled again, this time on Illinois' 1-yard line. Illinois recovered the fumble and drove for the game winning touchdown.</p>
<p>Before the Illinois game, George had carried the ball 25 times and scored 5 touchdowns, but for the rest of the season, he had only 12 more rushing attempts and didn't score once. In the following season, George was used as the team's third string running back, behind <a href="Raymont_Harris" title="wikilink">Raymont Harris</a>. He carried the ball only 42 times, mostly when Ohio State had a large lead late in games. However, as a junior, George became the team's starting running back and went on to rush for 1,442 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p>
<p>As a senior in the 1995 season, George rushed for a school record 1,927 yards and 24 touchdowns, an average of 152.2 yards per game. One of his best performances of the year was in a 45-26 win over the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a>, where he rushed for 207 yards, his third 200 yard game of the season. He also rushed for a school-record 314 yards and scored 3 touchdowns in OSU's victory over Illinois. In the 3 years since committing his 2 fumbles in the Illinois game as a freshman, George had over 600 rushing attempts and fumbled only 6 times. Ohio State finished the season with an 10-2 record and George won the <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> in the closest vote in the history of the award at the time, beating <a href="University_of_Nebraska" title="wikilink">University of Nebraska</a>'s <a href="Tommie_Frazier" title="wikilink">Tommie Frazier</a> by 264 ballots. Following the season, he was the first-round draft selection of the <a href="Houston_Oilers" title="wikilink">Houston Oilers</a> (now the <a href="Tennessee_Titans" title="wikilink">Tennessee Titans</a>). George left Ohio State second in school history in career rushing yards (3,768) and third in rushing touchdowns (44).</p>
<h2 id="professional-career">Professional career</h2>
<p>George won the <a href="National_Football_League_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NFL Rookie of the Year award</a> in 1996, and was the Oilers/Titans' starting <a href="tailback" class="uri" title="wikilink">tailback</a> through 2003, never missing a start due to injury. He made the <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowl</a> four consecutive years (1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2000), and assisted the Titans to a championship appearance in <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXIV" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXIV</a>, where they lost to the <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a> 23-16. George gained 391 combined rushing and receiving yards in the Titans' three playoff games that year and went on to rush for 95 yards, catch two passes for 35 yards, and score two touchdowns in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Numerous sports writers have suggested that a heavy workload was the primary factor in George's decline. In five of his eight seasons with the Titans, George carried the ball over 330 times. In 2003, George rushed for a near career low 3.3 yards per carry. George's decline in production along with numerous toe and ankle injuries were contributing factors in Titan's owner, Bud Adams decision to release him after George would not agree to a pay cut.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>George signed a one-year contract with the <a href="Dallas_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a> on July 23, 2004 for $1.5 million plus incentives that could have earned him more than the $4.25 million he would have made under his contract with the Titans, who released him on July 21, 2005 in part due to <a href="salary_cap" title="wikilink">salary cap</a> considerations. George only started 8 games for Dallas, rushing for 432 yards on 132 carries. He retired from the NFL before the 2005 season.</p>
<p>His career totals include 10,441 rushing yards, 268 receptions, 2,227 receiving yards, and 78 touchdowns (68 rushing and ten receiving).</p>
