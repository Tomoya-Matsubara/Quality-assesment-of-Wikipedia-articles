He is now a football <a href="coach_(sports)" title="wikilink">manager</a>, in charge of <a href="Football_League_Two" title="wikilink">League Two</a> side <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a>.</p>
<p>He started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in 1982. He played six seasons at <a href="Valley_Parade" title="wikilink">Valley Parade</a>, during which time he won the <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Division Three</a> championship, a title which was overshadowed by the <a href="Bradford_fire" title="wikilink">Bradford fire disaster</a> when 56 people died and in which his father <a href="Andy_McCall_(footballer_born_1925)" title="wikilink">Andy</a> was injured. After missing out on promotion in <a href="1987-88_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1987–88</a> he moved to <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a>, for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the <a href="1989_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1989 FA Cup Final</a>. In 1991 he moved to <a href="Rangers_F.C." title="wikilink">Rangers</a>, with whom he spent seven seasons and won six <a href="Scottish_Premier_League" title="wikilink">league</a> titles, three <a href="Scottish_Cup" title="wikilink">Scottish Cups</a> and two <a href="Scottish_League_Cup" title="wikilink">Scottish League Cups</a>. He returned to <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a> as captain to take them into the <a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">top division</a> of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to <a href="Sheffield_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield United</a>, where he retired as a player in 2005. McCall also won 40 <a href="cap_(sport)" title="wikilink">caps</a> for <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> and scored one goal in the <a href="1990_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1990 World Cup</a> in Italy.

<p>He was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker/player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to <a href="Neil_Warnock" title="wikilink">Neil Warnock</a> until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City for a third time, this time as manager on 1 June 2007.</p>

<p>McCall came through City's youth system after he was signed by <a href="George_Mulhall" title="wikilink">George Mulhall</a> in 1980 from Farsley Celtic at the age of 16,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> before becoming an apprentice in June 1981.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Mulhall's successor, <a href="Roy_McFarland" title="wikilink">Roy McFarland</a> gave McCall his debut at <a href="Reading_F.C." title="wikilink">Reading</a> on 28 August 1982—the opening day of the <a href="1982-83_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1982–83</a> season—when he deputised for <a href="Ces_Podd" title="wikilink">Ces Podd</a> at <a href="defender_(football)#Full_back" title="wikilink">right back</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He had played just six league games by 29 January 1983 when he made the first of 134 consecutive league appearances, all in midfield under new manager <a href="Trevor_Cherry" title="wikilink">Trevor Cherry</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> City finished 12th in <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Division Three</a> that season.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The <a href="1983-84_in_English_football" title="wikilink">following</a> season City struggled to make up for the absence of <a href="Bobby_Campbell_(Northern_Irish_footballer)" title="wikilink">Bobby Campbell</a>, who had left to join <a href="Derby_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Derby County</a>, and won just one of their first fifteen games,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> until Cherry bought Campbell back from Derby, and City won a record ten consecutive games on their way to a seventh place finish.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>During the summer of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of <a href="Defender_(football)" title="wikilink">central defender</a> <a href="Dave_Evans_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Dave Evans</a> and <a href="Midfielder#Winger" title="wikilink">right winger</a> <a href="John_Hendrie" title="wikilink">John Hendrie</a> to build on the previous season's high finish.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> McCall was an integral part of the team as City won the Division Three championship in <a href="1984-85_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1984–85</a>, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over <a href="Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Bolton Wanderers</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to <a href="Lincoln_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Lincoln City</a>. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the <a href="Bradford_City_disaster" title="wikilink">Bradford City disaster</a> when the <a href="Valley_Parade" title="wikilink">Valley Parade</a> ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to <a href="Bradford_Royal_Infirmary" title="wikilink">Bradford Royal Infirmary</a> and <a href="Pinderfields_General_Hospital" title="wikilink">Pinderfields Hospital</a> trying to find his father.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>For the following 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry and the players became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements in the months that followed, and the club's 13th place finish in <a href="Football_League_Second_Division" title="wikilink">Division Two</a> in <a href="1985-86_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1985–86</a> was hailed a major achievement.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at <a href="Odsal_Stadium" title="wikilink">Odsal Stadium</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after <a href="Peter_Jackson_(footballer_born_1961)" title="wikilink">Peter Jackson</a> moved to <a href="Newcastle_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Newcastle United</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Under Cherry's replacement, <a href="Terry_Dolan_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Terry Dolan</a>, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in <a href="1986-87_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1986–87</a>. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">Division One</a> club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Dolan brought in <a href="Paul_Tomlinson" title="wikilink">Paul Tomlinson</a>, <a href="Brian_Mitchell_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Brian Mitchell</a> and <a href="Lee_Sinnott" title="wikilink">Lee Sinnott</a> in a bid to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> They mounted a promotion challenge in <a href="1987-88_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1987–88</a> and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point on the last day of the season after a 3–2 defeat against <a href="Ipswich_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Ipswich Town</a> and then through <a href="Football_League_Championship_play-offs" title="wikilink">play-off</a> defeat to <a href="Middlesbrough_F.C." title="wikilink">Middlesbrough</a>, McCall left the club, signing for <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a> for <a href="pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>850,000 in June 1988.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, <em>The Real McCall</em>, about City's failure to strengthen the side in order to secure promotion.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>His departure was soured when he was forced to go to <a href="the_Football_League" title="wikilink">the Football League</a> with a <a href="Professional_Footballers&#39;_Association" title="wikilink">Professional Footballers' Association</a> representative to win &lt;U+00A3&gt;8,327.15 of an unpaid signing-on fee.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="everton">Everton</h3>
<p>McCall joined Everton at a time when its former triumphant side of the mid 1980s had broken up, following the ban on English sides competing in Europe, which marked the start of a period of underachievement at <a href="Goodison_Park" title="wikilink">Goodison Park</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> His Everton debut came in a 4–0 victory over <a href="Newcastle_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Newcastle United</a> on 27 August 1988 against his former teammate Hendrie, who was making his debut for Newcastle.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> McCall also returned to <a href="Valley_Parade" title="wikilink">Valley Parade</a> for a <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="wikilink">League Cup</a> tie, but his Everton side were knocked out by Bradford 3–1 on 14 December 1988.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He started 29 league games in <a href="1988-89_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1988–89</a> as well as another four substitute appearances. He was also a substitute in the <a href="1989_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1989 FA Cup Final</a> when he scored Everton's equaliser in the <a href="Merseyside_derby" title="wikilink">Merseyside derby</a> against <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> to take the game into extra-time. He scored another equaliser during extra-time, but Liverpool's own substitute <a href="Ian_Rush" title="wikilink">Ian Rush</a> also scored two to secure a 3–2 victory for Liverpool.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>McCall made a second appearance in an Everton shirt at Valley Parade, when he was invited by former teammate <a href="Mark_Ellis_(footballer_born_1962)" title="wikilink">Mark Ellis</a> to bring a side for his testimonial. In three seasons at Everton, McCall played 103 league games as well as earned his first <a href="cap_(sport)" title="wikilink">caps</a> with <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rangers">Rangers</h3>
<p>In 1991, <a href="Rangers_F.C." title="wikilink">Rangers</a> paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.2 million for McCall.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Rangers had just won their third successive <a href="Scottish_Football_League_Premier_Division" title="wikilink">Scottish Premier Division</a> title. Under manager <a href="Walter_Smith_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Walter Smith</a>, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles that firmly established them as Scotland's top club side after several years of being matched and often overtaken by <a href="Celtic_F.C." title="wikilink">Celtic</a> and <a href="Aberdeen_F.C." title="wikilink">Aberdeen</a>. In his first season at <a href="Ibrox_Stadium" title="wikilink">Ibrox</a>, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in <a href="1992-93_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">1992–93</a>, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> McCall also had European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the <a href="UEFA_Champions_League_1992-93" title="wikilink">UEFA Champions League 1992–93</a> final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners <a href="Olympique_de_Marseille" title="wikilink">Olympique de Marseille</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In <a href="1993-94_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">1993–94</a>, Rangers added another <a href="Scottish_League_Cup" title="wikilink">Scottish League Cup</a> title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the <a href="Scottish_Cup_1993-94" title="wikilink">Scottish Cup</a> to <a href="Dundee_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Dundee United</a>. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of <a href="Motherwell_F.C." title="wikilink">Motherwell</a>, but they failed to reach the final of either domestic cup. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals <a href="Celtic_F.C." title="wikilink">Celtic</a>, in <a href="1995-96_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">1995–96</a>, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated <a href="Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C." title="wikilink">Hearts</a> 5–1. Rangers again pushed Celtic into second place in <a href="1996-97_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">1996–97</a> and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in <a href="1997-98_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">1997–98</a> they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by just two points on the final day of the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2008, McCall became the 71st inductee into the Rangers hall of fame. McCall's former teammate and Rangers assistant manager <a href="Ally_McCoist" title="wikilink">Ally McCoist</a> presented him with the award.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>McCall still had one year left on his Rangers contract in 1998, but much of the team that <a href="Walter_Smith_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Walter Smith</a> had built had left and McCall was allowed to leave on a free transfer as long as he joined an English club.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="Barnsley_F.C." title="wikilink">Barnsley</a> and <a href="Huddersfield_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Huddersfield Town</a> were both interested in signing McCall, but he rejoined <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a> as club captain.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Rookie manager <a href="Paul_Jewell" title="wikilink">Paul Jewell</a> put together a squad to battle for promotion, adding other new signings, including central midfield partner <a href="Gareth_Whalley" title="wikilink">Gareth Whalley</a> and <a href="striker" class="uri" title="wikilink">striker</a> <a href="Lee_Mills" title="wikilink">Lee Mills</a>, who went on to be club's top goal-scorer.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The season started off slowly with just one win from the first seven games, but by the latter half of the season, City were vying with <a href="Ipswich_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Ipswich Town</a> and <a href="Birmingham_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Birmingham City</a> for the second promotion spot behind runaway leaders <a href="Sunderland_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Sunderland</a>. <a href="Loan_(football)" title="wikilink">Loan</a> signing <a href="Lee_Sharpe" title="wikilink">Lee Sharpe</a> and <a href="Dean_Windass" title="wikilink">Dean Windass</a> were added to the ranks and City had the chance to seal promotion in their penultimate game against relegation-threatened <a href="Oxford_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Oxford United</a>.

It was Bradford's home form—they earned 26 of their 36 points at Valley Parade—that was key to City avoiding relegation, which was narrowly averted by two points after a 1–0 final day victory over <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> in <a href="1999-2000_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1999–2000</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> When Jewell left only days after the season ended, McCall was appointed assistant manager to <a href="Chris_Hutchings" title="wikilink">Chris Hutchings</a>,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and subsequently served as caretaker manager for two games when Hutchings was sacked after just 12 games of the <a href="2000-01_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2000–01</a> league season.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> City were relegated with just 26 points.

However, he was only picked as a substitute and the referee blew the final whistle with McCall waiting to come on.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> This meant he was still eligible for both England and Scotland, and McCall eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father, making his debut in March 1988, ironically against England.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>He went on to be <a href="cap_(sport)" title="wikilink">capped</a> by the <a href="Scotland_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Scottish senior</a> team and made his debut on 28 March 1990 in a 1–0 friendly victory over <a href="Argentina_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> He played in five friendlies in 1990 which earned him a call up to the <a href="1990_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Italia 90 World Cup</a> squad.

They lost their first game 1–0 to <a href="Costa_Rica_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Costa Rica</a>, before McCall scored what would be his only international goal against <a href="Sweden_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Sweden</a> in a 2–1 victory.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> However, Scotland failed to qualify for the knock-out stage when they were defeated 1–0 by <a href="Brazil_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p>McCall admitted in his autobiography, <em>The Real McCall</em>, he wanted to manage Bradford.</p>
