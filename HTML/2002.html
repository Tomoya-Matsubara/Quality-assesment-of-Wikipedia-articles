<p>&quot;Sally&quot; received largely positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, &quot;Sally&quot; drew over 1.2 million viewers.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Jemaine_Clement" title="wikilink">Jemaine Clement</a> and <a href="Bret_McKenzie" title="wikilink">Bret McKenzie</a> attend a party thrown by Dave. Jemaine spots a beautiful blonde woman (<a href="Rachel_Blanchard" title="wikilink">Rachel Blanchard</a>) in the crowd and approaches her. Her name is Sally and she agrees to leave the party with him to get a <a href="kebab" class="uri" title="wikilink">kebab</a>. They end up back at the band's apartment but just as they begin kissing, they are disturbed by Bret turning the light on and an embarrassed Sally leaves.</p>
<p>The next morning they are discussing the incident. Jemaine thinks that Sally left because she found it weird Bret being there and turning on the light. However Bret thinks it is because he used to date Sally himself. No final conclusion is reached.</p>
<p>At a band meeting with Murray, they discuss the party and ways to increase the fan base, which currently consists of only one person—Mel (<a href="Kristen_Schaal" title="wikilink">Kristen Schaal</a>). Bret suggests that the band film a music video which Murray thinks is a great idea. So on the day of the filming, they visit Dave's <a href="pawn_shop" title="wikilink">pawn shop</a> to rent some video equipment, but due to a lack of funds, they are forced to resort to using a <a href="camera_phone" title="wikilink">camera phone</a> to do the filming. Despite these setbacks and the disappointing cardboard robot costumes made by Murray (they wanted ones like <a href="Daft_Punk" title="wikilink">Daft Punk</a>), they successfully manage to film an adequate video for &quot;Robots.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the following week, Jemaine starts spending a lot of time with Sally, which leaves Bret feeling lonely and neglected. When Bret suggests hanging out sometime, Jemaine invites him along on a dinner date with Sally, but they all feel a &quot;bit weird&quot; and Bret leaves early. On the way home, he is stopped by Mel who attempts to cheer him up, but fails miserably. Bret is soon joined in his unhappy mood by Jemaine, who gets dumped by Sally immediately following the dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;Sally&quot; first debuted on the internet, a month before the show premiered on <a href="HBO" class="uri" title="wikilink">HBO</a>. The network, in conjunction with <a href="MySpace" class="uri" title="wikilink">MySpace</a>, <a href="iTunes" class="uri" title="wikilink">iTunes</a>, <a href="Yahoo!_TV" title="wikilink">Yahoo!

<p>The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, in an advanced review of the episode, awarded &quot;Sally&quot; an &quot;amazing&quot; 9.2 out of 10 rating and called the series &quot;The funniest show you haven't seen yet.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The review noted that, &quot;<em>Flight of the Conchords</em> deserves the buzz it is slowly building. This is a very funny show.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Blogcritics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blogcritics</a> reviewer Daniel J. Stasiewski noted that the series was different for HBO, writing, &quot;<em>Flight of the Conchords</em> isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t <em>Entourage</em> or <em>Sex in the City</em> or even <em>Extras</em>. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s different. And sometimes different is just good.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Stasiewski, however, did note that the availability of the band's music on video sites like <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> meant that watching the series was not worth the cost of a cable subscription.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Further more, Stasiweski noted that while &quot;the fun, quirky music videos that pop-up can make this long half-hour worth watching [...] the 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren&lt;U+2019&gt;t groundbreaking comedy.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Chris Schonberger from <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the new series &quot;the funniest hour of comedy on television&quot; and noted that the performance of <a href="Rhys_Darby" title="wikilink">Rhys Darby</a> as Murray Hewitt was excellent, calling his character &quot;scene-stealing&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Finally, Schonberger positively compared the episode to the 2004 comedy film <em><a href="Napoleon_Dynamite" title="wikilink">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em>, writing, &quot;Indeed, the whole pilot vaguely reminded me of <em>Napoleon</em> in the way that the characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd activities&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
