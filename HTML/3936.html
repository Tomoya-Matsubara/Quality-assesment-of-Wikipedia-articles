<p><strong>Donnchadh</strong> or <strong>Donnchad</strong> (contemporary <a href="Latinization_(literature)" title="wikilink">Latinisation</a> <em>Duncanus</em>, later <a href="Anglicisation" title="wikilink">Anglicised</a> [mainly] as <em>Duncan</em>) was a <a href="Gall-Gaidhil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gall-Gaidhil</a> prince and <a href="Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> magnate in what is now south-western Scotland, whose career stretched from the last quarter of the 12th century until his death in 1250. His father, <a href="Gille-Brighde_of_Galloway" title="wikilink">Gille-Brighde of Galloway</a>, and his uncle, <a href="Uhtred_of_Galloway" title="wikilink">Uhtred of Galloway</a>, were the two rival sons of <a href="Fergus_of_Galloway" title="wikilink">Fergus</a>, &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; of <a href="Galloway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galloway</a>. As a result of Gille-Brighde's conflict with Uhtred and the Scottish monarch <a href="William_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">William the Lion</a>, Donnchadh became a hostage of <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry II of England</a>. He probably remained in England for almost a decade before returning north on the death of his father. Although denied succession to all the lands of the Gall-Gaidhil, he was granted lordship over <a href="Carrick,_Scotland" title="wikilink">Carrick</a> in the north-west.</p>
<p>Little is known about Donnchadh's life and rule. Allied to <a href="John_de_Courcy" title="wikilink">John de Courcy</a>, Donnchadh fought battles in Ireland and acquired land there that he subsequently lost. A patron of religious houses, particularly <a href="Melrose_Abbey" title="wikilink">Melrose Abbey</a> and <a href="North_Berwick" title="wikilink">North Berwick</a> <a href="nunnery" class="uri" title="wikilink">nunnery</a>, he attempted to establish a <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> in his own territory, at <a href="Crossraguel_Abbey" title="wikilink">Crossraguel</a>. He married the daughter of <a href="Alan_fitz_Walter" title="wikilink">Alan fitz Walter</a>, a leading member of the family later known as the <a href="House_of_Stewart" title="wikilink">House of Stewart</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;future monarchs of Scotland and England. Donnchadh was the first <a href="mormaer" class="uri" title="wikilink">mormaer</a> (&quot;<a href="earl" class="uri" title="wikilink">earl</a>&quot;) of Carrick, a region he ruled for more than six decades, making him one of the longest serving <a href="magnate" title="wikilink">magnates</a> in <a href="Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval Scotland</a>. His descendants include the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">Bruce</a> and Stewart Kings of Scotland, and probably the <a href="Clan_Campbell" title="wikilink">Campbell</a> <a href="Duke_of_Argyll" title="wikilink">Dukes of Argyll</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>Donnchadh's career is not well documented in the surviving sources. <a href="Charter" title="wikilink">Charters</a> provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called <a href="cartulary" title="wikilink">cartularies</a>) from the <a href="Galwegian_Gaelic" title="wikilink">Gaelic south-west</a> have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned in the body of these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Some English government records describe his activities in relation to Ireland, and occasional <a href="chronicle" class="uri" title="wikilink">chronicle</a> entries from England and the English-speaking regions of what became south-eastern Scotland record other important details. Aside from the <em><a href="Chronicle_of_Melrose" title="wikilink">Chronicle of Melrose</a></em>, the most significant of these sources are the works of <a href="Roger_of_Hoveden" title="wikilink">Roger of Hoveden</a>, and the material preserved in the writings of <a href="John_of_Fordun" title="wikilink">John of Fordun</a> and <a href="Walter_Bower" title="wikilink">Walter Bower</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Roger of Hoveden wrote two important works: the <em>Gesta Henrici II</em> (&quot;Deeds of Henry II&quot;, alternatively titled <em>Gesta Henrici et Ricardi</em>, &quot;Deeds of Henry and Richard&quot;) and the <em>Chronica</em>, the latter a re-worked and supplemented version of the former.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These works are the most important and valuable sources for Scottish history in the late 12th century.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <em>Gesta Henrici II</em> covers the period from 1169 to April 1192, and the <em>Chronica</em> covers events until 1201.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Roger of Hoveden is particularly important in relation to what is now south-western Scotland, the land of the <a href="Gall-Gaidhil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gall-Gaidhil</a>. He served as an emissary in the region in 1174 on behalf of the English monarch, and thus his account of, for example, the approach of Donnchadh's father Gille-Brighde towards the English king comes from a witness.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Historians rely on Roger's writings for a number of important details about Donnchadh's life: that Gille-Brighde handed Donnchadh over as a hostage to <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> under the care of Hugh de Morwic, Sheriff of Cumberland; that Donnchcadh married the daughter of <a href="Alan_fitz_Walter" title="wikilink">Alan fitz Walter</a> under protest from the Scottish king; and that Donnchadh fought a battle in Ireland in 1197 assisting <a href="John_de_Courcy" title="wikilink">John de Courcy</a>, Prince of Ulster.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Donnchadh's ancestry cannot be traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from contemporary sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier than him.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also the name of the father of <a href="Somerled" title="wikilink">Somhairle</a>, <a href="Lord_of_Argyll" title="wikilink">petty king of Argyll</a> in the third quarter of the 12th century.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>There is a &quot;body of circumstantial evidence&quot; that suggests Donnchadh's mother was a daughter or sister of <a href="Donnchadh_II,_Earl_of_Fife" title="wikilink">Donnchadh II, Earl of Fife</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> This includes Donnchadh's association with the <a href="Cistercian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cistercian</a> <a href="nunnery" class="uri" title="wikilink">nunnery</a> of North Berwick, founded by Donnchadh II of Fife's father, <a href="Donnchad_I,_Earl_of_Fife" title="wikilink">Donnchadh I of Fife</a>; close ties seem to have existed between the two families, while Donnchadh's own name is further evidence.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The historian who suggested this in 2000, <a href="Richard_Oram" title="wikilink">Richard Oram</a>, came to regard this conjecture as certain by 2004.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Roger of Hoveden described <a href="Uhtred_of_Galloway" title="wikilink">Uhtred of Galloway</a> as a <em>consanguinus</em> (&quot;cousin&quot;) of King Henry II of England, an assertion that has given rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, they must have been from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a>; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However, according to historian <a href="G._W._S._Barrow" title="wikilink">G.

<p>It is unclear how many siblings Donnchadh had, but two at least are known.

<p>According to Hoveden, in May 1186 Henry ordered the king and magnates of Scotland to subdue Lochlann; in response Lochlann &quot;collected numerous horse and foot and obstructed the entrances to Galloway and its roads to what extent he could&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Richard Oram did not believe that the Scots really intended to do this, as Lochlann was their dependent and probably acted with their consent; this, Oram argued, explains why Henry himself raised an army and marched north to <a href="Carlisle,_Cumbria" title="wikilink">Carlisle</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> When Henry arrived he instructed King William and his brother <a href="David_of_Huntingdon" title="wikilink">David, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, to come to Carlisle, and to bring Lochlann with them.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>There is no record of any subsequent court hearing, but the <em>Gesta Annalia I</em> relates that Donnchadh was granted Carrick on condition of peace with Lochlann, and emphasises the role of King William (as opposed to Henry) in resolving the conflict.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Richard Oram has pointed out that Donnchadh's grant to Melrose Abbey between 1189 and 1198 was witnessed by his cousin Lochlann, evidence perhaps that relations between the two had become more cordial.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Although no details are given any contemporary source, Donnchadh gained possession of some of his father's land in the west of the kingdom of Gall-Gaidhil, namely the &quot;earldom&quot; of Carrick.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>When Donnchadh adopted or was given the title of &quot;earl&quot; (Latin: <em>comes</em>), or in his own language <em>mormaer</em>, is a debated question. Historian <a href="Alan_Orr_Anderson" title="wikilink">Alan Orr Anderson</a> argued that he began using the title of <em>comes</em> between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in <a href="Cosmo_Innes" title="wikilink">Cosmo Innes</a>'s printed version of the cartulary), was dated by Anderson to 1214.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In this charter, Donnchadh has no title.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> By contrast Donnchadh was styled <em>comes</em> in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Oram however pointed out that Donnchadh was styled <em>comes</em> in a grant to Melrose Abbey witnessed by Richard de Morville (Melrose 32), who died in 1196.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> If the wording in this charter is accurate, then Donnchadh was using the title before Richard's death: that is, in or before 1196.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Furthermore, while Anderson dated Melrose 192 with reference to Abbot William III de Courcy (abbot of Melrose from 1215 to 1216), Oram identified Abbot William as Abbot William II (abbot from 1202 to 1206).<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Whenever Donnchadh adopted the title, he is the first known &quot;earl&quot; of the region.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>Records exist for Donnchadh's religious patronage, and these records provide evidence for Donnchadh's associates as well as the patronage itself.

<p>There are records of patronage towards the nunnery of North Berwick, a house founded by Donnchadh's probable maternal grandfather or great-grandfather Donnchadh I of Fife.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> He gave that house the <a href="rectorship" class="uri" title="wikilink">rectorship</a> of the church of <a href="St_Cuthbert" title="wikilink">St Cuthbert</a> of Maybole sometime between 1189 and 1250.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In addition to Maybole, he gave the church of <a href="St_Brigit" title="wikilink">St Brigit</a> at Kirkbride to the nuns, as well as a grant of 3 marks from a place called <em>Barrebeth</em>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Relations with the bishop of Glasgow, within whose diocese Carrick lay, are also attested.

<p>It is clear from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the condition that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually.

<p>Charter evidence reveals two Anglo-Normans present in Donnchadh's territory. Some of Donnchadh's charters to Melrose were subscribed by an Anglo-Norman knight named Roger de Skelbrooke, who appears to have been Lord of <a href="Greenan_Castle" title="wikilink">Greenan</a>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> De Skelbrooke himself made grants to Melrose regarding the land of <em>Drumeceisuiene</em> (i.e. <a href="Drumshang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Drumshang</a>), grants confirmed by &quot;his lord&quot; Donnchadh.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> This knight gave Melrose fishing rights in the river Doon, rights confirmed by Donnchadh too and later by Roger's son-in-law and successor Ruaidhri mac Gille-Escoib (<em>Raderic mac Gillescop</em>).<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>Donnchadh's interests in the area were damaged when de Courcy lost his territory in eastern Ulster to his rival <a href="Hugh_de_Lacy" title="wikilink">Hugh de Lacy</a> in 1203.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> John de Courcy, with help from his wife's brother King R&lt;U+01EB&gt;gnvaldr Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;r&lt;U+00F8&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;arson (Raghnall mac Gofraidh) and perhaps from Donnchadh, tried to regain his principality, but was initially unsuccessful.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> De Courcy's fortunes were boosted when <a href="Hugh_de_Lacy,_1st_Earl_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Hugh de Lacy</a> (then <a href="Earl_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Earl of Ulster</a>) and his associate <a href="William_de_Braose,_7th_Baron_Abergavenny" title="wikilink">William III de Briouze</a>, themselves fell foul of John; the king campaigned in Ireland against them in 1210, a campaign that forced de Briouze to return to <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a> and de Lacy to flee to <a href="St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St Andrews</a> in Scotland.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>English records attest to Donnchadh's continued involvement in Ireland. One document, after describing how William de Briouze became the king's enemy in England and Ireland, records that after John arrived in Ireland in July 1210 :  The <em>Histoire des Ducs de Normandie</em> recorded that William and Matilda had voyaged to the Isle of Man, en route from Ireland to Galloway, where they were captured.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Matilda was imprisoned by the king, and died of starvation.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Another document, this one preserved in an Irish <a href="memoranda_roll" title="wikilink">memoranda roll</a> dating to the reign of <a href="Henry_VI_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry VI</a> (reigned 1422&lt;U+2013&gt;1461), records that after John's Irish expedition of 1210, Donnchadh controlled extensive territory in <a href="County_Antrim" title="wikilink">County Antrim</a>, namely the settlements of <a href="Larne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Larne</a> and <a href="Glenarm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glenarm</a> with 50 <a href="carucate" title="wikilink">carucates</a> of land in between, a territory similar to the later barony of Upper Glenarm.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> King John had given or recognised Donnchadh's possession of this territory, and that of Donnchadh's nephew Alaxandair (Alexander), as a reward for his help; similarly, John had given Donnchadh's cousins <a href="Alan_of_Galloway" title="wikilink">Ailean</a> and T&lt;U+00F3&gt;mas, sons of Lochlann, a huge lordship equivalent to 140 <a href="knight&#39;s_fee" title="wikilink">knight's fees</a> that included most of northern County Antrim and <a href="County_Londonderry" title="wikilink">County Londonderry</a>, the reward for use of their soldiers and <a href="galley" title="wikilink">galleys</a>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1219 however Donnchadh and his nephew appear to have lost all or most of his Irish land; a document of that year related that the <a href="Justiciar_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Justiciar of Ireland</a>, Geoffrey de Marisco, had dispossessed (&quot;<a href="Disseisin" title="wikilink">disseised</a>&quot;) them believing they had conspired against the king in the rebellion of 1215&lt;U+2013&gt;6.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The king, John's successor <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a>, found that this was not true and ordered the Justiciar to restore Donnchadh and his nephew to their lands.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> By 1224, Donnchadh had still not regained these lands and de Lacy's adherents were gaining more ground in the region. King Henry III repeated his earlier but ineffective instructions: he ordered <a href="Henry_de_Loundres" title="wikilink">Henry de Loundres</a>, <a href="Archbishop_of_Dublin_(Roman_Catholic)" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Dublin</a> and new Justiciar of Ireland, to restore to Donnchadh &quot;the remaining part of the land given to him by King John in Ireland, unless anyone held it by his father's own precept&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in the same year Donnchadh wrote to King Henry. His letter was as follows:  Henry's response was a <a href="writ" class="uri" title="wikilink">writ</a> to his Justiciar:  It is unlikely that Donnchadh ever regained his territory; after Hugh was formally restored to the Earldom of Ulster in 1227, Donnchadh's land was probably controlled by the Bisset family. Historian S&lt;U+00E9&gt;an Duffy argues that the Bissets (later known as the &quot;Bissets of the Glens&quot;) helped Hugh de Lacy, and probably ended up with Donnchadh's territory as a reward.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and legacy</h2>
<p>Donnchadh was said by the <em>Martyrology of Glasgow</em> to have died on 13 June 1250.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> He was succeeded in the earldom by <a href="Niall_of_Carrick" title="wikilink">Niall</a>. The traditional view, going back to the 19th century, is that Niall was Donnchadh's son.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> This view has been undermined with more recent research by genealogist Andrew MacEwen, who has argued that Niall was not the son of Donnchadh, but rather his grandson, a view embraced by leading Scottish medievalist Professor G. W. S. Barrow.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> According to this argument, Donnchadh's son and intended heir was <a href="Cailean_mac_Donnchaidh" title="wikilink">Cailean mac Donnchaidh</a> (alias <em>Nicholaus</em>), who as his son and heir, issued a charter in Donnchadh's lifetime, but seemingly predeceased him.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> It was further suggested that Cailean's wife, Earl Niall's mother, was a daughter of the <a href="Tir_Eoghain" title="wikilink">Tir Eoghain</a> king Niall Ruadh &lt;U+00D3&gt; Neill, tying in with Donnchadh's Irish activities, accounting for the use of the name Niall, and explaining the strong alliance with the &lt;U+00D3&gt; Neill held by Niall's grandsons.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>Another of Donnchadh's sons, E&lt;U+00F3&gt;in (John), owned the land of Straiton. He was involved in the <a href="Gille_Ruadh" title="wikilink">Galwegian revolt of Gille-Ruadh</a> in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the <a href="diocese_of_Glasgow" title="wikilink">diocese of Glasgow</a>.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and the land of <em>Hachinclohyn</em> to <a href="William_de_Bondington" title="wikilink">William de Bondington</a>, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was <a href="parson" class="uri" title="wikilink">parson</a> of <em>Kirchemanen</em>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Cailean, and presumably Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>Donnchadh's probable grandson, Niall, was earl for only six years and died leaving no son but four daughters, one of whom is known by name.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The last, presumably the eldest, was his successor Marjory, who married in turn Adam of Kilconquhar (died 1269), a member of the <a href="Mac_Duibh" title="wikilink">Mac Duibh</a> family of Fife, and <a href="Robert_VI_de_Brus" title="wikilink">Robert VI de Brus</a>, <a href="Lord_of_Annandale" title="wikilink">Lord of Annandale</a>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Marjorie's son Robert VII de Brus, through military success and ancestral kinship with the <a href="Dunkeld_dynasty" title="wikilink">Dunkeld dynasty</a>, became King of the Scots as <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert I</a>. King Robert's brother, <a href="Edward_Bruce" title="wikilink">Edward Bruce</a>, became if only for a short time and only in name, <a href="High_King_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">High King of Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Bruces and their successors to the Scottish throne the title Earl of Carrick became a prestigious honorific title usually given to a son of the king or intended heir;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> at some time between 1250 and 1256 Earl Niall, anticipating that the earldom would be taken over by a man from another family, issued a charter to Lochlann (<em>Roland</em>) of Carrick, a son or grandson of one of Donnchadh's brothers. The charter granted Lochlann the title <em>Cenn Cineoil</em>, &quot;head of the kindred&quot;, a position which brought the right to lead the men of Carrick in war. The charter also conferred possession of the office of baillie of Carrick under whoever was earl.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Precedent had been established here by other native families of Scotland, something similar having already taken place in Fife; it was a way of ensuring that the kin-group retained strong locally-based male leadership even when the newly imposed common law of Scotland forced the comital title to pass into the hands of another family.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> By 1372 the office had passed&lt;U+2014&gt;probably by marriage&lt;U+2014&gt;to the <a href="Marquess_of_Ailsa" title="wikilink">Kennedy family of Dunure</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>The 17th-century genealogical compilation known as <em>Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells</em> by Robert Duncanson, minister of <a href="Campbeltown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Campbeltown</a>, claimed that &quot;Efferic&quot; (i.e. Affraic or Afraig), wife of <a href="Gilleasbaig_of_Menstrie" title="wikilink">Gilleasbaig of Menstrie</a> (fl. 1263&lt;U+2013&gt;6) and mother of Campbell progenitor <a href="Cailean_M&lt;U+00F3&gt;r" title="wikilink">Cailean M&lt;U+00F3&gt;r</a>, was the daughter of one Cailean (anglicised <em>Colin</em>), &quot;Lord of Carrick&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Partly because <em>Ane Accompt</em> is a credible witness to much earlier material, the claim is thought probable.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Thus Donnchadh was likely the great-grandfather of Cailean M&lt;U+00F3&gt;r, a lineage that explains the popularity of the names Donnchadh (Duncan) and Cailean (Colin) among later Campbells, as well as their close alliance to King Robert I during the <a href="Scottish_Wars_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
