<p>In <a href="ancient_Roman_religion" title="wikilink">ancient Roman religion</a> and <a href="Roman_mythology" title="wikilink">myth</a>, <strong>Mars</strong> () was the <a href="god_of_war" title="wikilink">god of war</a> and also an <a href="Roman_agriculture" title="wikilink">agricultural</a> guardian, a combination characteristic of early <a href="ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Rome</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was second in importance only to <a href="Jupiter_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Neptune_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Neptune</a> and he was the most prominent of the military gods in the <a href="Religion_in_the_Roman_military" title="wikilink">religion of the Roman army</a>. Most of his <a href="Roman_festivals" title="wikilink">festivals</a> were held in March, the month named for him (<a href="Martius_(month)" title="wikilink">Latin <em>Martius</em></a>), and in October, which began and ended the season for military campaigning and farming.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="Hellenization" title="wikilink">influence of Greek culture</a>, Mars was <a href="interpretatio_graeca" title="wikilink">identified with</a> the <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek god</a> <a href="Ares" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ares</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> whose <a href="myth" title="wikilink">myths</a> were reinterpreted in <a href="Latin_literature" title="wikilink">Roman literature</a> and <a href="Roman_art" title="wikilink">art</a> under the name of Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in <a href="Ancient_Greek_literature" title="wikilink">Greek literature</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Mars was a part of the <a href="Capitoline_Triad" title="wikilink">Archaic Triad</a> along with Jupiter and <a href="Quirinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quirinus</a>, the latter of whom as a guardian of the Roman people had no Greek equivalent. Mars' altar in the <a href="Campus_Martius" title="wikilink">Campus Martius</a>, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by <a href="Numa_Pompilius" title="wikilink">Numa</a>, the peace-loving semi-legendary second <a href="Kings_of_Rome" title="wikilink">king of Rome</a>. Although the center of Mars' worship was originally located outside the sacred boundary of Rome <em>(<a href="pomerium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pomerium</a>)</em>, <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> made the god a renewed focus of <a href="Religion_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman religion</a> by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in <a href="Forum_of_Augustus" title="wikilink">his new forum</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Ares was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way <a href="Pax_Romana" title="wikilink">to secure peace</a>, and was a father <em>(pater)</em> of the Roman people.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the mythic <a href="genealogy" class="uri" title="wikilink">genealogy</a> and <a href="Founding_of_Rome" title="wikilink">founding myths of Rome</a>, Mars was the father of <a href="Romulus_and_Remus" title="wikilink">Romulus and Remus</a> with <a href="Rhea_Silvia" title="wikilink">Rhea Silvia</a>. His love affair with <a href="Venus_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Venus</a> symbolically reconciled the two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero <a href="Aeneas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeneas</a>, celebrated as the <a href="Trojan_War" title="wikilink">Trojan refugee</a> who &quot;founded&quot; Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.</p>
<p>The importance of Mars in establishing religious and cultural identity within the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a> is indicated by the vast number of <a href="epigraphy" title="wikilink">inscriptions</a> identifying him with a local deity, particularly in the <a href="Roman_province" title="wikilink">Western provinces</a>.</p>
<h2 id="birth">Birth</h2>

<p>Although Ares was the son of <a href="Zeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeus</a> and <a href="Hera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hera</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Mars was the son of <a href="Juno_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Juno</a> alone. Jupiter had usurped the mother's function when he gave birth to <a href="Minerva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minerva</a> directly from his forehead (or mind); to restore the balance, Juno sought the advice of the goddess <a href="Flora_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Flora</a> on how to do the same. Flora obtained a magic flower (Latin <em>flos</em>, plural <em>flores</em>, a <a href="grammatical_gender" title="wikilink">masculine word</a>) and tested it on a <a href="wikt:heifer" title="wikilink">heifer</a> who became fecund at once. She then plucked a flower ritually using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her. Juno withdrew to <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a> and the <a href="Sea_of_Marmara" title="wikilink">shore of Marmara</a> for the birth.</p>
<p><a href="Ovid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ovid</a> tells this story in the <em><a href="Fasti_(Ovid)" title="wikilink">Fasti</a></em>, his long-form poetic work on the <a href="Roman_calendar" title="wikilink">Roman calendar</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It may explain why the <a href="Matronalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matronalia</a>, a festival celebrated by married women in honor of Juno as a <a href="Lucina_(goddess)" title="wikilink">goddess of childbirth</a>, occurred on the first day of Mars' month, which is also marked on a <a href="Chronography_of_354" title="wikilink">calendar from late antiquity</a> as the birthday of Mars. In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and the god would have been born with the new year.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Ovid is the only source for the story. He may be presenting a literary myth of his own invention, or an otherwise unknown <a href="Ancient_peoples_of_Italy" title="wikilink">archaic Italic</a> tradition; either way, in choosing to include the story, he emphasizes that Mars was connected to plant life and was not alienated from female nurture.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="consort">Consort</h2>
<p>The <a href="wikt:consort" title="wikilink">consort</a> of Mars was <a href="Nerio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nerio</a> or Nerine, &quot;Valor.&quot; She represents the vital force <em>(vis)</em>, power <em>(potentia)</em> and majesty <em>(maiestas)</em> of Mars.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Her name was regarded as <a href="Sabine_language" title="wikilink">Sabine</a> in origin and is equivalent to Latin <em><a href="virtus_(virtue)" title="wikilink">virtus</a>,</em> &quot;manly virtue&quot; (from <em>vir</em>, &quot;man&quot;).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the early 3rd century BC, the comic playwright <a href="Plautus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plautus</a> has a reference to Mars greeting Nerio, his wife.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A source from <a href="late_antiquity" title="wikilink">late antiquity</a> says that Mars and Nerine were celebrated together at a festival held on March 23.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the later <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>, Nerine came to be identified with Minerva.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Nerio probably originates as a divine <a href="personification" class="uri" title="wikilink">personification</a> of Mars' power, as such <a href="abstraction" title="wikilink">abstractions</a> in Latin are generally <a href="grammatical_gender" title="wikilink">feminine</a>. Her name appears with that of Mars in an archaic prayer <a href="Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#invocatio" title="wikilink">invoking</a> a series of abstract qualities, each paired with the name of a deity. The influence of <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a> and its <a href="Anthropotheism" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic gods</a> may have caused Roman writers to treat these pairs as &quot;marriages.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="venus-and-mars">Venus and Mars</h3>
<p>The union of Venus and Mars held greater appeal for poets and philosophers, and the couple were a frequent subject of art. In Greek myth, the adultery of Ares and <a href="Aphrodite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aphrodite</a> had been exposed to ridicule when her husband <a href="Hephaestus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hephaestus</a> (whose Roman equivalent was <a href="Vulcanus" title="wikilink">Vulcan</a>) caught them in the act by means of a magical snare. Although not originally part of the Roman tradition, in 217 BC Venus and Mars were presented as a complementary pair in the <em><a href="lectisternium" class="uri" title="wikilink">lectisternium</a></em>, a public banquet at which images of <a href="Di_Consentes" title="wikilink">twelve major gods</a> of the Roman state were presented on couches as if present and participating.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Mars_and_Venus_MAN_Napoli_Inv9248.jpg" title="fig:Wall painting (mid-1st century AD) from which the House of Venus and Mars at Pompeii takes its name" alt="Wall painting (mid-1st century AD) from which the House of Venus and Mars at Pompeii takes its name" /> Scenes of Venus and Mars in <a href="Roman_art" title="wikilink">Roman art</a> often ignore the adulterous implications of their union, and take pleasure in the good-looking couple attended by <a href="Cupid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cupid</a> or multiple Loves <em>(amores)</em>. Some scenes may imply marriage,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and the relationship was romanticized in funerary or domestic art in which husbands and wives had themselves portrayed as the passionate divine couple.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The uniting of deities representing Love and War lent itself to <a href="allegory" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegory</a>, especially since the lovers were the parents of <a href="Harmonia_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Harmonia</a>. The Renaissance philosopher <a href="Marsilio_Ficino" title="wikilink">Marsilio Ficino</a> notes that &quot;only Venus dominates Mars, and he never dominates her&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In ancient Roman and Renaissance art, Mars is often shown disarmed and relaxed, or even sleeping, but the extramarital nature of their affair can also suggest that this peace is impermanent.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="essential-nature">Essential nature</h2>
<p><a href="Virility" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virility</a> as a kind of life force <em>(vis)</em> or virtue <em>(virtus)</em> is an essential characteristic of Mars.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> As an agricultural guardian, he directs his energies toward creating conditions that allow crops to grow, which may include warding off hostile forces of nature.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> As an embodiment of masculine aggression, he is the force that drives wars &lt;U+2013&gt; but ideally, war that delivers a secure peace.</p>
<p>The priesthood of the <a href="Arval_Brethren" title="wikilink">Arval Brothers</a> called on Mars to drive off &quot;rust&quot; <em>(lues)</em>, with its double meaning of <a href="Wheat_leaf_rust" title="wikilink">wheat fungus</a> and the <a href="rust" title="wikilink">red oxides</a> that affect metal, a threat to both iron farm implements and weaponry. In the <a href="Carmen_Arvale" title="wikilink">surviving text of their hymn</a>, the Arval Brothers invoked Mars as <em>a god</em>, &quot;savage&quot; or &quot;feral&quot; like a wild animal.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Mars' potential for savagery is expressed in his obscure connections to the wild woodlands, and he may even have originated as a god of the wild, beyond the boundaries set by humans, and thus a force to be <a href="wikt:propitiate" title="wikilink">propitiated</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In his <a href="De_Agri_Cultura" title="wikilink">book on farming</a>, <a href="Cato_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Cato</a> invokes <em><a href="Mars_(mythology)#Mars_Silvanus" title="wikilink">Mars Silvanus</a></em> for a ritual to be carried out <em>in silva</em>, in the woods, an uncultivated place that if not held within bounds can threaten to overtake the fields needed for crops.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Mars' character as an agricultural god may derive solely from his role as a defender and protector,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> or may be inseparable from his warrior nature,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> as the leaping of his armed priests the <a href="Salii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salii</a> was meant to quicken the growth of crops.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sacred-animals">Sacred animals</h2>
<p><img src="Altar_Mars_Venus_Massimo_lupa.jpg" title="fig:She-wolf and twins from an altar to Venus and Mars" alt="She-wolf and twins from an altar to Venus and Mars" /> <img src="Specht_01.jpg" title="fig:Black Woodpecker, perhaps the picus Martius of the Romans" alt="Black Woodpecker, perhaps the picus Martius of the Romans" width="100" /> The two wild animals most sacred to Mars were the woodpecker and the wolf, which in the natural lore of the Romans were said always to inhabit the same foothills and woodlands.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> notes that the woodpecker <em>(picus)</em> is sacred to Mars because &quot;it is a courageous and spirited bird and has a <a href="beak" class="uri" title="wikilink">beak</a> so strong that it can overturn oaks by pecking them until it has reached the inmost part of the tree.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As the beak of the <em>picus Martius</em> contained the god's power to ward off harm, it was carried as a <a href="amulet" title="wikilink">magic charm</a> to prevent <a href="bee_sting" title="wikilink">bee stings</a> and <a href="leech" class="uri" title="wikilink">leech</a> bites.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The bird of Mars also guarded a woodland herb <em>(<a href="paeonia_(plant)" title="wikilink">paeonia</a>)</em> used for treatment of the <a href="Human_gastrointestinal_tract" title="wikilink">digestive</a> or <a href="Female_reproductive_system_(human)" title="wikilink">female reproductive systems</a>; those who sought to harvest it were advised to do so by night, lest the woodpecker jab out their eyes.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The <em>picus Martius</em> seems to have been a particular species, but authorities differ on which one: perhaps <em><a href="Picus_viridis" title="wikilink">Picus viridis</a></em><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> or <em><a href="Dryocopus_martius" title="wikilink">Dryocopus martius</a></em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The woodpecker was revered by the <a href="Latins_(Italic_tribe)" title="wikilink">Latin peoples</a>, who abstained from eating its flesh.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It was one of the most important birds in Roman and Italic <a href="augur" title="wikilink">augury</a>, the practice of reading the will of the gods through watching the sky for signs.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The mythological figure named <a href="Picus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picus</a> had powers of augury that he retained when he was transformed into a woodpecker; in one tradition, Picus was the son of Mars.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The <a href="Umbrian_language" title="wikilink">Umbrian</a> <a href="cognate" class="uri" title="wikilink">cognate</a> <em>peiqu</em> also means &quot;woodpecker,&quot; and the Italic <a href="Picentes" title="wikilink">Picenes</a> were supposed to have derived their name from the <em>picus</em> who served as their guide animal during a ritual migration <em>(<a href="ver_sacrum" title="wikilink">ver sacrum</a>)</em> undertaken as a rite of Mars.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In the territory of the <a href="Aequi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aequi</a>, another Italic people, Mars had an <a href="oracle" class="uri" title="wikilink">oracle</a> of great antiquity where the prophecies were supposed to be spoken by a woodpecker perched on a wooden column.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Mars' association with the wolf is familiar from what may be the most famous of <a href="Roman_mythology" title="wikilink">Roman myths</a>, the story of how a she-wolf <em>(lupa)</em> suckled his infant sons when they were <a href="Infanticide#Greece_and_Rome" title="wikilink">exposed</a> by order of their human uncle, who feared that they would take back the kingship he had <a href="usurper" title="wikilink">usurped</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The woodpecker also brought nourishment to the twins.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The wolf appears elsewhere in Roman art and literature in masculine form as the animal of Mars. A statue group that stood along the <a href="Appian_Way" title="wikilink">Appian Way</a> showed Mars in the company of wolves.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> At the <a href="Battle_of_Sentinum" title="wikilink">Battle of Sentinum</a> in 295 BC, the appearance of the wolf of Mars <em>(Martius lupus)</em> was a sign that Roman victory was to come.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Gallo-Roman_culture" title="wikilink">Roman Gaul</a>, the goose was associated with the <a href="Mars_(mythology)#Provincial_epithets" title="wikilink">Celtic forms of Mars</a>, and archaeologists have found geese buried alongside warriors in graves. The goose was considered a bellicose animal because it is easily provoked to aggression.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sacrificial-animals">Sacrificial animals</h3>
<p><a href="Religion_in_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek</a> and Roman religion distinguished between animals that were sacred to a deity and those that were prescribed as the correct <a href="animal_sacrifice" title="wikilink">sacrificial offerings</a> for the god. Wild animals might be viewed as already belonging to the god to whom they were sacred, or at least not owned by human beings and therefore not <a href="Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#do_ut_des" title="wikilink">theirs to give</a>. Since sacrificial meat was eaten at a banquet after the gods received their portion &lt;U+2013&gt; mainly the entrails <em>(<a href="Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#exta" title="wikilink">exta</a>)</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; it follows that the animals sacrificed were most often, though not always, domestic animals normally part of the Roman diet.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gods often received castrated male animals as sacrifices, and the goddesses female <a href="Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion#victima" title="wikilink">victims</a>; Mars, however, regularly received intact males.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Mars did receive <a href="oxen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxen</a> under a few of his cult titles, such as <a href="Mars_(mythology)#Mars_Grabovius" title="wikilink">Mars Grabovius</a>, but the usual offering was the bull, singly, in multiples, or in combination with other animals.</p>

The Altar of Augustan Peace <em>(<a href="Ara_Pacis_Augustae" title="wikilink">Ara Pacis Augustae</a>)</em> was located there, as was the <a href="Obelisk_of_Montecitorio" title="wikilink">Obelisk of Montecitorio</a>, imported from <a href="Roman_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> to form the pointer <em>(<a href="gnomon" class="uri" title="wikilink">gnomon</a>)</em> of the <a href="Solarium_Augusti" title="wikilink">Solarium Augusti</a>, a giant <a href="sundial" class="uri" title="wikilink">sundial</a>. With its public gardens, the Campus became one of the most attractive places in the city to visit.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustus chose the Campus Martius as the site of his new Temple to Mars Ultor, a manifestation of Mars he cultivated as the avenger <em>(ultor)</em> of the <a href="assassination_of_Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">murder of Julius Caesar</a> and of the military disaster suffered at the <a href="Battle_of_Carrhae" title="wikilink">Battle of Carrhae</a>. When the legionary standards lost to the Parthians were recovered, they were housed in the new temple. The date of the temple's dedication on May 12 was aligned with the <a href="heliacal_setting" title="wikilink">heliacal setting</a> of the constellation <a href="Scorpio_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Scorpio</a>, the <a href="house_(astrology)" title="wikilink">house</a> of war.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The date continued to be marked with <a href="ludi_circenses" title="wikilink">circus games</a> as late as the mid-4th century AD.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="Roman_art" title="wikilink">Roman art</a>, Mars is depicted as either bearded and mature, or young and clean-shaven. Even <a href="Nude_(art)" title="wikilink">nude</a> or seminude, he often wears a helmet or carries a spear as emblems of his warrior nature. Mars was among the deities to appear on the earliest Roman coinage in the late 4th and early 3rd century BC.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>On the Altar of Peace <em>(Ara Pacis)</em>, built in the last years of the 1st century BC, Mars is a mature man with a &quot;handsome, <a href="Classicism" title="wikilink">classicizing</a>&quot; face, and a short curly beard and moustache. His helmet is a plumed <a href="neo-Attic" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-Attic</a>-<a href="Attic_helmet" title="wikilink">type</a>. He wears a military cloak <em>(<a href="paludamentum" class="uri" title="wikilink">paludamentum</a>)</em> and a <a href="muscle_cuirass" title="wikilink">cuirass</a> ornamented with a <a href="gorgoneion" class="uri" title="wikilink">gorgoneion</a>. Although the <a href="relief" class="uri" title="wikilink">relief</a> is somewhat damaged at this spot, he appears to hold a spear <a href="laurel_wreath" title="wikilink">garlanded in laurel</a>, symbolizing a peace that is won by military victory. The 1st-century statue of Mars found in the <a href="Forum_of_Nerva" title="wikilink">Forum of Nerva</a> (pictured at top) is similar. In this guise, Mars is presented as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people. The panel of the <em>Ara Pacis</em> on which he appears would have faced the Campus Martius, reminding viewers that Mars was the god whose altar Numa established there, that is, the god of Rome's oldest civic and military institutions.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Particularly in works of art influenced by <a href="ancient_Greek_art" title="wikilink">the Greek tradition</a>, Mars may be portrayed in a manner that resembles Ares, youthful, beardless, and often nude.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In the Renaissance, Mars' nudity was thought to represent his lack of fear in facing danger.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>The festivals of Mars cluster in his namesake month of March (Latin <em><a href="Martius_(month)" title="wikilink">Martius</a></em>), with a few observances in October, the beginning and end of the season for military campaigning and agriculture. Festivals with horse racing took place in the Campus Martius. Some festivals in March retained characteristics of new year festivals, since <em>Martius</em> was originally the first month of the <a href="Roman_calendar" title="wikilink">Roman calendar</a>.</p>

<p><a href="File:Mars_Balearicus_cropped.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=.5|left|&quot;Mars Balearicus&quot;</a> &quot;Mars Balearicus&quot; is a name used in modern scholarship for small bronze warrior figures from <a href="Mallorca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mallorca</a> (one of the <a href="Balearic_Islands" title="wikilink">Balearic Islands</a>) that are interpreted as representing the local Mars cult.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> These statuettes have been found within <a href="Talaiot" title="wikilink">talayotic</a> sanctuaries with extensive evidence of burnt offerings. &quot;Mars&quot; is fashioned as a lean, athletic nude lifting a lance and wearing a helmet, often conical; the genitals are perhaps semi-erect in some examples.</p>
<p>Other bronzes at the sites represent the heads or horns of bulls, but the bones in the ash layers indicate that sheep, goats, and pigs were the sacrificial victims. Bronze horse-hooves were found in one sanctuary. Another site held an imported statue of <a href="Imhotep" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imhotep</a>, the legendary <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_medicine" title="wikilink">Egyptian physician</a>.
