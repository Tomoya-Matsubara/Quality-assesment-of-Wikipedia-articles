<p><a href="Stand_Watie" title="wikilink">Stand Watie</a>, along with a few Cherokee, sided with the Confederate Army, in which he was made colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Reluctantly, on October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the U.S. Government to the Confederate States.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In the treaty, the Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools and other goods, as well as a delegate to the <a href="Confederate_Congress" title="wikilink">Confederate Congress</a> at Richmond.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> As a result of the treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the <a href="Battle_of_Pea_Ridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>, Arkansas, March 7&lt;U+2013&gt;8, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the Union forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, Federal troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the Union army.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="William_Holland_Thomas" title="wikilink">William Holland Thomas</a>, the only white chief of the <a href="Eastern_Band_of_Cherokee_Indians" title="wikilink">Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</a>, recruited hundreds of Cherokees, particularly for <a href="Thomas&#39;_Legion" title="wikilink">Thomas' Legion</a>. The Legion, raised in September 1862, fought until the end of the war.</p>

<p>Choctaw <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> battalions were formed in Indian Territory and later in Mississippi in support of the southern cause. The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General <a href="Albert_Pike" title="wikilink">Albert Pike</a> authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that &quot;with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp and garrison equippage was furnished to any of them.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Albert Pike negotiated several treaties with Native American tribes, including the <a href="Treaty_with_Choctaws_and_Chickasaws" title="wikilink">Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws</a> in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms, covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate States of America</a> citizenship possibilities, and a entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>Mississippi Choctaws were captured in <a href="Ponchatoula,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Ponchatoula, Louisiana</a>, and several died in a <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a> prison in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Spann describes the incident, &quot;[Maj. J.W. Pearce] established two camps &lt;U+2013&gt; a recruiting camp in Newton County and a drill camp at Tangipahoa &lt;U+2013&gt; just beyond the State boundary line in Louisiana in the fall of 1862. <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> at that time was in the hands of the Federal Gen. <a href="B.F._Butler" title="wikilink">B.F. Butler</a>. Without notice a reconnoitering party of the enemy raided the camp, and captured over two dozen Indians and several noncommissioned white officers and carried them to New Orleans. All the officers and several of the Indians escaped and returned to the Newton County camp; but all the balance of the captured Indians were carried to New York, and were daily paraded in the public parks as curiosities for the sport of sight-seers.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>In Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory, Jackson McCurtain, who would later become a district chief, was elected as representative from Sugar Loaf County to the National Council in October 1859. On June 22, 1861, he enlisted in the First Regiment of Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles. He was commissioned Captain of Company G under the command of Colonel Douglas H. Cooper of the Confederate Army. In 1862 he became a Lieutenant Colonel of the First Choctaw Battalion.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
