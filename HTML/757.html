<h3 id="main-event-matches">Main event matches</h3>
<p>The main match was a singles match between Ric Flair and Triple H. The match was a Steel Cage match, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, causing Flair to bleed from the head, the blood loss results from previous cuts that wrestlers perform before a match called <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#B" title="wikilink">blading</a>. A spot in the match saw Triple H retrieve a steel chain in which he wrapped around his fist and attempted a <a href="Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques#Diving_fist_drop" title="wikilink">diving fist drop</a> from the top turnbuckle. Flair, however, countered as he raised his foot to hit Triple H in the face and performed a series of chops to Triple H's chest. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Figure_four_leglock" title="wikilink">figure four leglock</a>, a signature move of Flair's, which resulted in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. Flair followed this by <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Biting" title="wikilink">biting</a> the head of Triple H, resulting in him bleeding from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either in a corner of the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match concluded after Flair reversed a move where Triple H would have <a href="Facebuster#Double_underhook_facebuster" title="wikilink">tucked his head between his knees and jumped up</a> to slam his head to the mat, with a <a href="Professional_wrestling_throws#Back_body_drop" title="wikilink">back body drop</a> and three chair shots to the head.

<p>The main event was the WWE Championship match, in which John Cena defended the title against Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels, who received the fans' vote to be part of the Triple Threat match. During the beginning of the match, Cena performed a back body drop on Angle, sending him to outside. Michaels, who had been thrown out of the ring, received the upper hand over Cena until Angle returned to the match and performed a variety of suplexes on both Michaels and Cena. Mid-way in the match, Angle and Michaels double teamed Cena, lifting him in the air crashing face-first on the Spanish announce table. Back in the ring, Angle <a href="Professional_wrestling_throws#Olympic_slam" title="wikilink">lifted Michaels on his shoulders and spinned 90&lt;U+00B0&gt;</a> to slam him down to the mat, a move Angle calls the Angle Slam, from the top of the turnbuckles. Angle then tried to apply the <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Ankle_lock" title="wikilink">ankle lock</a> hold on Michaels, but Cena came into the ring and clotheslined Angle out of the ring. Cena proceeded by executing a back body drop on Michaels and attempting to perform a <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Fist_drop" title="wikilink">fist drop</a> with theatrics, but was pulled out of the ring by Angle, who tossed him over the security barricade. The match concluded when Angle caught Cena in the ankle lock. Michaels, who was on the outside, climbed the top rope and <a href="Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques#Diving_elbow_drop" title="wikilink">drove his cocked elbow onto Angle's chest</a>, who was laying on the mat holding onto Cena's ankle. Michaels performed a <a href="superkick" class="uri" title="wikilink">superkick</a>, which saw the sole of his foot strike Angle's chin, a move in which Michaels calls Sweet Chin Music. Following this, Cena lifted Michaels over his shoulders and threw him down to execute the <a href="Professional_wrestling_throws#Fireman&#39;s_carry_takeover" title="wikilink">FU</a>. Cena got the pinfall victory and thus retained his title.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
