<p><strong>James &quot;Jemmy&quot; Moore</strong> (1839 &lt;U+2013&gt; 19 April 1890) was an Australian <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who played a single  match for <a href="New_South_Wales_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> during the 1861&lt;U+2013&gt;62 season.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Ampthill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ampthill</a>, <a href="Bedfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedfordshire</a>, Moore was the much younger brother of <a href="George_Moore_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">George Moore</a>, who had emigrated to Australia in 1852. Jemmy Moore joined his brother in <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> later in the decade, assisting with his baking and confectionary business in <a href="Maitland,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Maitland</a>. The Moore brothers were both keen cricketers, and, according to one source, were at one point &quot;undoubtedly the best bowlers in New South Wales&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A New South Wales team visited <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a> in January 1862, and Jemmy Moore was included in the side to play <a href="Victoria_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. In what was retrospectively recognised as his only first-class match,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> he finished with 2/20 in Victoria's first innings, taking the wickets of <a href="J._B._Thompson" title="wikilink">J. B. Thompson</a> and <a href="Charles_Makinson" title="wikilink">Charles Makinson</a>. In New South Wales' second innings (after <a href="follow_on" title="wikilink">following on</a>), he was the second highest scorer, with 21 runs. Victoria won the match by 10 wickets.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="English_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1861&lt;U+2013&gt;62" title="wikilink">An English side</a> led by <a href="H._H._Stephenson" title="wikilink">H. H. Stephenson</a> toured later in the 1861&lt;U+2013&gt;62 season, the first overseas tour of Australia. Moore played a number of matches against the side &lt;U+2013&gt; one for a New South Wales XXII, and two for a combined New South Wales and Victoria XXII.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He opened the bowling in the first two matches, bowling over 30 four-ball overs in each of the English side's first innings, but was later overshadowed by his brother George, who took seventeen wickets in the final two matches in Sydney.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jemmy Moore once again played for New South Wales when <a href="English_cricket_team_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand_in_1863&lt;U+2013&gt;64" title="wikilink">another English side</a> led by <a href="George_Parr_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">George Parr</a> toured during the 1863&lt;U+2013&gt;64 season,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and also featured in a match against a <a href="Queensland_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> XXII, finishing with 9/14 in Queensland's second innings.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Moore subsequently went to <a href="Brisbane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a> to play and coach professionally, but he returned to Maitland after a few years, looking after the local cricket pitch. He died in Maitland in 1890 after a brief illness.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A number of Moore's relations went on to play at high levels &lt;U+2013&gt; two sons, <a href="Leon_Moore" title="wikilink">Leon</a> and <a href="Bill_Moore_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill</a>, and two grandnephews, <a href="Frank_Cummins_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Frank Cummins</a> and <a href="Charlie_Macartney" title="wikilink">Charlie Macartney</a>, all played for New South Wales.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
