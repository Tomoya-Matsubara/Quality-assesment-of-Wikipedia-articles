<p>The <strong>History of Primorsky Krai</strong> dates back to prehistory.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="Primorsky_Krai" title="wikilink">Primorsky Krai</a> () also known as <em>Primorye</em> (), is a <a href="federal_subjects_of_Russia" title="wikilink">federal subject</a> of <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> (a <a href="krai" class="uri" title="wikilink">krai</a>). <em>Primorsky</em> means &quot;maritime&quot; in Russian, hence the region is sometimes referred to as maritime province. Historically it was defined by the <a href="Sikhote-Alin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sikhote-Alin</a> (also spelled Sikhotae-Alin) <a href="mountain_range" title="wikilink">mountain range</a> which extends about 900 km to the northeast of the Russian Pacific seaport of <a href="Vladivostok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vladivostok</a>, and the <a href="Amur_River" title="wikilink">Amur</a> lowlands to the west. Its proximity to the populations of the Asia's north-east dempographic centres had produced an extremely rich history of population interaction, of which the <a href="Russians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russians</a> are the newest additions during the recent four centuries of settlement and development of the region.</p>

<h4 id="first-people-on-the-territory-of-primorye">First people on the territory of Primorye</h4>
<p>According to the archaeological data, people first appeared in the territory of modern  in the <a href="Upper_Paleolithic" title="wikilink">Upper Paleolithic</a> period (Ancient <a href="stone_Age" title="wikilink">stone Age</a>) 10 to 30 thousand years ago.</p>
<p>There are not many sites of ancient people here. The most ancient site is considered to be the one near <a href="Osinovka,_Primorye" title="wikilink">Osinovka</a> village near <a href="Ussuriysk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ussuriysk</a>, where archaeologist <a href="Alexey_Pavlovich_Okladnikov" title="wikilink">A.P.Okladnikov</a> found human stone tools, which were made of river pebbles.</p>
<p>The finds from the <a href="Geograficheskogo_Obschestva_Cave" title="wikilink">Geograficheskogo Obshchestva (Geographic Society) Cave</a> (located in <a href="Partizansky_District,_Primorsky_Krai" title="wikilink">Partizansky District</a>) were very useful in understanding life and economy of the ancient people. This was the only cave where archaeologists had found the bones of animals that had been eaten by people:e <a href="mammoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">mammoth</a>, <a href="bison" class="uri" title="wikilink">bison</a>, <a href="rhinoceros" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhinoceros</a>, <a href="deer" class="uri" title="wikilink">deer</a>, <a href="cave_tiger" title="wikilink">cave tiger</a>, etc.</p>
<p>The sites at the <a href="Zerkalnaya_river" title="wikilink">Zerkalnaya (Mirror) River</a> Valley near <a href="Ustinovka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ustinovka</a> and <a href="Suvorovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suvorovo</a> villages (<a href="Kavalerovsky_District" title="wikilink">Kavalerovsky District</a>) date from later times. The stone tools from these sites are different from the finds near Osinovka village; they were made in a different way (using the <a href="lamellar_technique" title="wikilink">lamellar technique</a> of stone processing). The similarity of all stone tools from the Zerkalnaya River Valley let the researchers put them into one Ustinovsky archaeological culture. It is interesting that the materials of the Ustinovsky archaeological culture are somewhat similar to the finds from the territories which have boundaries with Primorye, especially in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Paleolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleolithic</a> period people led nomadic life. Small groups of several dozens people were moving within their territories. Men were occupied with hunting and fishing, women - with collecting and housekeeping, elder people - with children's education. The most wise and able of them were put at the head of a group.</p>
<p>In the Palaeolithic period the main occupation of the ancient people was hunting. People were skillful hunters; they were using <a href="spear" title="wikilink">spears</a>, <a href="dart_(missile)" title="wikilink">darts</a>, and different kinds of <a href="Animal_trapping" title="wikilink">traps</a>. The <a href="climate" class="uri" title="wikilink">climate</a> conditions allowed for active collecting of edible plants.</p>
<h4 id="primorye-in-the-neolithic-period">Primorye in the Neolithic period</h4>
<p>The <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> period (New Stone Age) in Primorye started in the 7th-6th millennium BC. In the New Stone Age the activities of ancient people changed drastically. In many regions the economies became production-based, not appropriation-based as before. This process is called the <a href="Neolithic_Revolution" title="wikilink">Neolithic Revolution</a>. In Primorye it was accompanied with the appearance of <a href="earthenware" class="uri" title="wikilink">earthenware</a> (<a href="ceramic" title="wikilink">ceramics</a>), the wide spreading of polishing techniques, sawing, and new kinds of tools.</p>
<p>One of the typical Neolithic monuments of in Primorye is the site in <a href="Chyortovy_Vorota_cave" title="wikilink">Chyortovy Vorota (Devil's Gates) cave</a> (<a href="Dalnegorsky_District" title="wikilink">Dalnegorsky District</a>). In this cave the traces of wooden dwelling, which burnt in the middle of the 5th millennium BC, were discovered. The site contained a lot of unharmed archaeological materials, which included hundreds of stone- and bone-made wares, ceramic vessels, and the fragments of five human skeletons. Among the stone- and bone-made wares there were polished and retouched <a href="arrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">arrow</a>, <a href="dart_(missile)" title="wikilink">dart</a>, and <a href="spear" class="uri" title="wikilink">spear</a> tips, <a href="axe" title="wikilink">axes</a>, <a href="chisel" title="wikilink">chisels</a> of <a href="schist" class="uri" title="wikilink">schist</a>, various decorations. Flat-bottomed ceramic utensils were decorated with geometrical pattern.</p>
<p>During transition to the New Stone Age the population of Primorye started fishing. Fishing became dominant in the New Stone Age. Excavations held a lot of pebble-made sinkers. In the Chyortovy Vorota cave remains of fishing nets were found. The cartiloginous fish caught during spawning was stored for winter. People knew and were using fire since the Stone Age already. It is possible that fish was not only dried and jerked, but also smoked.</p>
<p>One of the Neolithic monuments of Primorye, which is not similar to the others, is <a href="Valentin-Peresheyek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valentin-Peresheyek</a> (Valentin-Isthmus) settlement (<a href="Lazovsky_District" title="wikilink">Lazovsky District</a>). This was a specialized settlement for <a href="iron_ore" title="wikilink">iron ore</a> mining and mineral paint making. For this purpose the ancient people were using stone <a href="mattock" title="wikilink">mattocks</a>, <a href="pestle" title="wikilink">pestles</a>, grating slabs. Special researches determined the purpose of many different tools such as <a href="scraper_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">scrapers</a>, <a href="piercer" title="wikilink">piercers</a>, adzes, drills, etc. It was found that handicrafts, such as <a href="Fur" title="wikilink">pelt</a>, bone, and horn processing, etc, were very important for the life of settlement's ancient dwellers. The settlement subsisted in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC.</p>
<p>The Neolithic monuments are also common in the south and south-west of Primorye. Some of them form Zaysanovsky archeological culture. Many of them were excavated. In Boysman Bay (<a href="Chernigovsky_District" title="wikilink">Chernigovsky District</a>) the first in Primorye Neolithic burial ground was discovered.</p>
<p>In <a href="Siny_Gay" title="wikilink">Siny (Blue) Gay</a> settlement (<a href="Chernigovsky_District" title="wikilink">Chernigovsky District</a>) the remains of 30 Neolithic dwellings were found. The remains included various tools, ceramics with vertical zigzag ornaments, and works of applied art.</p>
<p>During the New Stone Age due to the transition to the settled way of life, the possibilities for community enlargement appeared. Its typical traits were collectivism and mutual aid. The territory of Primorye was opened up from the seashore to river valleys.</p>
<p>By the end of the New Stone Age the population of Primorye started to show premises of agriculture. The process of transition from appropriation to production started, bringing stabilization of food supply.</p>
<h4 id="theory-of-the-far-eastern-nidus-of-neolithic-cultures">Theory of the Far Eastern nidus of Neolithic cultures</h4>
<p>Any study of archaeological monuments and cultures of a certain region inevitably leads to the necessity of their comparison with neighboring and distant territories'. Such an analysis lets reveal general and special traits of the population development of different regions. In 1930s A.P.Okladnikov assumed the south of the <a href="Russian_Far_East" title="wikilink">Russian Far East</a> to be a special center of Neolithic cultures. This theory was further developed in 1950-60s. It was found that the Neolithic cultures of  and <a href="Priamurye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Priamurye</a> had principle differences from the cultures of <a href="taiga" class="uri" title="wikilink">taiga</a> <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> in material culture, economy, and lifestyle. If for Neolithic Siberia the nomadic way of life was typical, in Primorye and Priamurye ancient people were settled. Excavations of the Neolithic settlements commonly discover long-term half-dug-out dwellings. For ceramic vessels in Primorye and Priamurye flat bottoms are common, while in Siberia they are bulging. Fishing was common among Neolithic tribes of the southern Far East of Russia, while in taiga Siberia hunting was more widespread. The art of Primorye and Priamurye had its own original traits.</p>
<p>The economy of Neolithic tribes of Primorye and Priamurye was well-developed. Recently it was found that they had <a href="agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>, which means the transition of primitive economy to the higher level of development.</p>
<h3 id="primorye-in-the-iron-age">Primorye in the Iron Age</h3>
<h4 id="the-bronze-age">The Bronze Age</h4>
<p>A new cultural and historical period - the <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a> - began in Primorye in the end of the 2nd millennium BC. At that time people discovered properties of a new type of raw materials for their tools. It was iron. Even now there are no reliable data if the region had its own bronze metallurgy in the 2nd - 1st millennium BC, or all of the bronze articles were imported to the region. Excavations of the Bronze Age monuments usually reveal not the bronze articles themselves, but their stone imitations (replicas).</p>
<p>One of the most famous Bronze Age monuments in Primorye is <a href="Siny_Gay" title="wikilink">Siny Gay</a> settlement. Seventeen dwellings, several ritual animal burial grounds, and, most important, numerous bronze articles were excavated here. Amphora-type vessels, pots, and cups (almost without ornaments) were found in this settlement. Stone articles mostly contained polished tools. The settlement dates from the last centuries of the 2nd millennium BC to the first centuries of the 1st millennium BC. Many Bronze Age monuments are located on the eastern coast of Primorye. Archaeologists find stone imitations of spear and knife bronze tips, &quot;blocks&quot; of soft light stone. The most intensive excavations were held in <a href="Lidovka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lidovka</a> (<a href="Dalnegorsky_District" title="wikilink">Dalnegorsky District</a>) and <a href="Blagodatny" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blagodatny</a> (<a href="Terneysky_District" title="wikilink">Terneysky District</a>) settlements (a so-called Lidovsky archaeological culture). A lot of retouched and polished articles had been found there. <a href="Crockery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crockery</a> was usually thin-walled and without ornament, but pots with rims decorated with impressions of different forms were also common. These monuments date from the 10th-5th centuries BC.</p>
<p>The Bronze Age in Primorye was a period of the production economy development (agriculture and stock-raising). Excavations extracted the remains of burnt millet and pigs' bones. In this period small groups were being replaced with stable communities counting from tens to thousands people. Inside the communities the elders' power was strengthening. The communities united into tribes on the basis of blood, marriage, economy, culture, and other relationships. With the tribes appearance the struggle among the communities for leadership began.</p>
<p>In general, the Bronze Age in Primorye is viewed by the researchers as a period of spreading of bronze items imitations, of prosperity of stone tools production, and production economy development. In Primorye, the transition from the Bronze to <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> was rather quick.</p>

<p>From 698 to 926, the kingdom of <a href="Balhae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balhae</a> occupied northern <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a> and parts of <a href="Manchuria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchuria</a> and <a href="Primorsky_Krai" title="wikilink">Primorsky Krai</a>, consisting of the <a href="Nanai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanai</a>, the <a href="Udege" class="uri" title="wikilink">Udege</a>, and the <a href="Evenks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Evenks</a> and descendants of the <a href="Tungusic_languages" title="wikilink">Tungus</a>-speaking people and the people of the recently fallen <a href="Goguryeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goguryeo</a> kingdom of Korea.

<p>In 1860, after several centuries under <a href="Qing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qing</a> control, Primorye was ceded to Russian control. The area was traditionally part of the <a href="Jilin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jilin</a> province.</p>
<h3 id="korean-immigration">Korean immigration</h3>

<p>Beginning in 1863, Koreans emigrated from the <a href="Korean_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Korean Peninsula</a> to the Russian Far East, some of them in order to wage guerilla warfare against Japanese colonial forces in Korea and others who considered Siberia a land where they could lead better lives. The numbers of Koreans in the provence dramatically increased and by 1869 Koreans made up about 20% of the province's population. By 1897, Koreans had outnumbered Russians in the <a href="Russian_Far_East" title="wikilink">Russian Far East</a> and by 1902, over 310,000 Koreans lived in the region alone. Korean communities and towns began to become established throughout the province.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, both Russia and Korea came into conflict with Japan. Following the end of the <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a> in 1907, Russia enacted an anti-Korean law at the order of the Japanese governemnt, under which the land of Korean farmers was confiscated and Korean laborers were laid off. Russia continued to serve as the center for the Korean independence movement against Japan. Koreans continued to escape to the Russian Far East and Northern China.</p>
<p>Soon Siberia was home to Koreans that had organised into armies to oppose Japanese forces in Korea. In 1919, the March First Movement for Korean independence was supported by Korean leaders who gathered in Vladivostok's Sinhanchon (literally, &quot;New Korean Village&quot;) neighborhood. This neighborhood became a center for nationalist activities, including arms supply and trading. The Japanese attacked the settlement on April 4, 1920, leaving hundreds of nationalists and civilans dead.</p>
<p>Between 1937 and 1939, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin deported over 200,000 Koreans to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, fearing that the Koreans might act as spies for Japan. About 100,000 Koreans died on the way in cattle trains due to starvation, illness, or freezing conditions. Many community leaders were purged and executed, Koryo-saram were not allowed to travel outside of Central Asia for the next 15 years. Koreans were also not allowed to use the Korean language and its use began to become lost with the involvement of <a href="Koryo-mar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Koryo-mar</a> and the use Russian.</p>
<p>Today 125,000 Koreans continue to live in Russia, about a quarter of them in the Russian Far East and in Primorsky Krai. Russia has the second largest Koryo-saram population behind Uzbekistan. Most of Koryo-saram in the province today have few command of Korean and generally speak either Koryo-mar or Russian. Buddhist temples and churches serve as community centers for the population.</p>

<p>Russia was in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean in the early 1900s for the navy as well as for maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok was operational only during the summer season, but <a href="L&lt;U+00FC&gt;shunkou" title="wikilink">Port Arthur</a> would be operational all year. From the end of the <a href="First_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">First Sino-Japanese War</a>, and 1903 negotiations between the tsars's government and Japan had proved futile. Japan chose war to protect its exclusive dominance in Korea. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting the populace from government repression and rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes. Japan issued a declaration of war on 8 February 1904. However, three hours before Japan's declaration of war was received by the Russian Government, the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> attacked the Russian Far East Fleet at Port Arthur. Eight day later Russia declared war on Japan.</p>
<p>The war ended in September 1905 with a Japanese victory following the fall of Port Arthur and a failed invasion of Japan through the Korean Peninsula and Northeast China and a threat of Japan invading Primorsky Krai via Korea. The <a href="Treaty_of_Portsmouth" title="wikilink">Treaty of Portsmouth</a> was later signed and both Japan and Russia agreed to evacuate <a href="Manchuria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchuria</a> and return its sovereignty to China, but Japan was leased the Liaodong Peninsula (containing Port Arthur and Talien), and the Russian rail system in southern Manchuria with access to strategic resources. Japan also received the southern half of the Island of Sakhalin from Russia. Russia was also forced to confiscate land from Korean settlers who formed the majority of Primorsky Krai's population due to a fear of a invasion of Korea and ousting of Japanese troops by Korean guerillas.</p>

<h3 id="border-clashes-with-the-japanese">Border clashes with the Japanese</h3>

<p>The Soviet&lt;U+2013&gt;Japanese Border Wars were a series of border conflicts between the Soviet Union and Japan between 1938 and 1945.</p>
<p>After the occupation of <a href="Manchukuo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchukuo</a> and Korea, Japan turned its military interests to Soviet territories. Conflicts between the Japanese and the Soviets frequently happened on the border of Manchuria. The first confrontation occurred in Primorsky Krai, the <a href="Battle_of_Lake_Khasan" title="wikilink">Battle of Lake Khasan</a> was an attempted military incursion of Manchukuo (Japanese) into the territory claimed by the Soviet Union. This incursion was founded in the beliefs of the Japanese side that the Soviet Union misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary based on the Treaty of Peking between Imperial Russia and Manchu China. Primorsky Krai was always threatened by a Japanese invasion despite most of the remaining clashes occurred in Manchuko. The clashes ended shortly before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>'s when a weakened Japan found its territories of Manchukuo, <a href="Mengjiang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mengjiang</a>, Korea, and southern <a href="Sakhalin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sakhalin</a> invaded by Soviet and Mongolian troops.</p>
<p>After the Soviet invasion, Manchuko and Mengjiang were returned to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> and Korea became liberated. All but the 4 southernmost <a href="Kuril_Islands" title="wikilink">Kuril Islands</a> and southern Sakhalin were returned to the Soviet Union following the end of World War II. The Soviet Union soon established a <a href="sphere_of_influence" title="wikilink">sphere of influence</a> and eventually took over the northern half of the Korean Peninsula in 1948 and established the communist state of <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a>, which sparked the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>.</p>
<h3 id="role-during-the-world-war-ii">Role during the World War II</h3>
<p>Primorsky Krai was a strategic location in World War II for both the Soviet Union and Japan and clashes over the territory were common as Soviets and <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">allies</a> considered it a key location to invade Japan through Korea and Japan viewed it as a key location to begin a mass invasion of Eastern Russia. Between 1941 and 1945, Japanese and Soviet troops often clashed over the territory sometimes deep within Primorsky Krai or within Manchukuo. Primorsky Krai also served as the Soviet Union's Pacific headquarters in the war to plan an invasion for allied troops of Korea in order to reach Japan.</p>
<h3 id="role-during-the-cold-war">Role during the Cold War</h3>
<p>In October 1948, the Soviet Union invaded the northern half of the Korean Peninsula (<a href="38th_parallel_north" title="wikilink">38th parallel</a>) from Primorsky Krai and the United States took over the southern half. This divided the peninsula into a Soviet-backed communist <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a> and a democratic, pro-<a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a>. On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops backed by Soviet troops who crossed into North Korea from Primorsky Krai and <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South Korea which caused the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>. After the war ended in a stalemate between North and South Korea and with the two nations' borders roughly established backed to the 38th parallel, Primorsky Krai was the site of extreme security in the Cold War.</p>
<p><a href="Vladivostok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vladivostok</a> was the site of the <a href="Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks" title="wikilink">Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</a> in 1974. At the time, the Soviet Union and the United States decided quantitative limits on various nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers. Vladivostok and other cities in Primorsky Krai soon became <a href="closed_cities" title="wikilink">closed cities</a> because of the base of the <a href="Soviet_Pacific_Fleet" title="wikilink">Soviet Pacific Fleet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="primorsky-krai-within-the-russian-federation">Primorsky Krai within the Russian Federation</h2>
<p>Today Primorsky Krai is the largest economy in the Russian Far East and is home to almost 2.1 million people, 89.89% Russian, 4.54% Ukrainian, and 0.86% Korean, mostly descendants of those who weren't deported to Central Asia in 1937. The history of the Krai has largely been influenced by Asia, especially Korea and Japan (in World War II) in the past decades.</p>
