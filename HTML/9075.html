<p><strong>Rory Gallagher</strong> (<a href="2_March" title="wikilink">2 March</a>, <a href="1948" class="uri" title="wikilink">1948</a>–<a href="14_June" title="wikilink">14 June</a>, <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a>) was an <a href="Irish_ethnicity" title="wikilink">Irish</a> <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a>/<a href="Rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock</a> <a href="guitarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitarist</a>, born in <a href="Ballyshannon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballyshannon</a>, <a href="County_Donegal" title="wikilink">County Donegal</a>, grew up in <a href="Cork_City" title="wikilink">Cork City</a> in the south of <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. He is best known for his tenure in <a href="Taste_(band)" title="wikilink">Taste</a> and his solo work.</p>
<h2 id="life-and-works">Life and works</h2>
<p>Gallagher's first bands were <a href="showband" title="wikilink">showbands</a> which played the popular <a href="chart-topper" title="wikilink">hits</a> of the day. In 1965 he turned The Impact into an <a href="Rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">R'n'B</a> group which played gigs in Ireland and <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>. He formed <a href="Taste_(band)" title="wikilink">Taste</a> in 1966, but the line-up which became legendary was formed in 1967, featuring his guitar and vocals, the jazz-tinged drumming of John Wilson and intricate bass playing of Richard McCracken. <a href="Sound_recording_and_reproduction" title="wikilink">Recordings</a> of the earlier version of Taste are still available and it's interesting to compare Gallagher's rudimentary guitar playing to the virtuosity that became evident fairly soon after in the later Taste. This was the group who released two <a href="recording_studio" title="wikilink">studio</a> <a href="album" title="wikilink">albums</a>, <em>Taste</em> and <em>On the Boards</em>, and made two live recordings, <em>Live at Montreux</em> and <em>Live at the Isle of Wight</em>. The latter appeared a long time after the band broke up at that same <a href="Isle_of_Wight_Festival" title="wikilink">Isle of Wight Festival</a> in 1970. A legend of blues music, Gallagher played with many of the genre's biggest stars, including collaboration with <a href="Muddy_Waters" title="wikilink">Muddy Waters</a> and <a href="Jerry_Lee_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> on their respective <em>London Sessions</em> in the mid 70s and Gallagher received invitations to jam with <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a> following the loss of their lead guitarist <a href="Mick_Taylor" title="wikilink">Mick Taylor</a>, and <a href="Canned_Heat" title="wikilink">Canned Heat</a> after the departure of The Eagle.</p>
<p>After the demise of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring bass player <a href="Gerry_McAvoy" title="wikilink">Gerry McAvoy</a> to play on his first eponymous 'solo' album (a relationship that would last twenty years on the road) and Wilgar Campbell on drums.</p>
<p>The <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a> were Gallagher's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, <em>Live in Europe</em> and <em>Irish Tour '74</em> which for many captured best his bands' raw and naturally dynamic qualities. The classic line-up is largely considered to be with Rod De'Ath' on drums and Lou Martin on <a href="keyboard_instrument" title="wikilink">keyboards</a> between 1973 and 1978. Other release highlights include <em>Against the Grain</em> and the jazz tinged <em>Calling Card</em> album, assisted in production by <a href="Roger_Glover" title="wikilink">Roger Glover</a> (bassist with <a href="Deep_Purple" title="wikilink">Deep Purple</a>) and the hard blues-rocking <em>Photo Finish</em> and <em>Top Priority</em> albums with Ted McKenna on drums.</p>
<p>In 2003 <em>Wheels Within Wheels</em> a collection of acoustic tracks was released posthumously by Gallagher's brother Donal Gallagher. Collaborators on this album included Bert Jansch, Martin Carthy, <a href="The_Dubliners" title="wikilink">The Dubliners</a> and <a href="Lonnie_Donegan" title="wikilink">Lonnie Donegan</a>.</p>
<p>He played and recorded what he said was &quot;in me all the time, and not just something I turn on ...&quot;. Though he sold over thirty million albums world wide it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. His passion and skill for the blues is well documented in the 1974 film <em>Irish Tour '74</em> directed by Tony Palmer.</p>
<p>In 1972 he was voted <a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a>'s Top Musician of the Year, dethroning <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>. His album <em>Live in Europe</em> has been a big selling album not only in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> but also internationally. Generally regarded as one of the most influential guitarists ever, many of today's top musicians, including <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">The Edge</a> from <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, <a href="Slash_(musician)" title="wikilink">Slash</a> of <a href="Guns_N&#39;_Roses" title="wikilink">Guns N' Roses</a> fame, <a href="Johnny_Marr" title="wikilink">Johnny Marr</a> of <a href="the_Smiths" title="wikilink">the Smiths</a>, <a href="Glenn_Tipton" title="wikilink">Glenn Tipton</a> of <a href="Judas_Priest" title="wikilink">Judas Priest</a>, <a href="Vivian_Campbell" title="wikilink">Vivian Campbell</a> of <a href="Def_Leppard" title="wikilink">Def Leppard</a>, and <a href="Brian_May" title="wikilink">Brian May</a> of <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a> cite Gallagher as an inspiration in their formative musical years. It is also well documented that the Rolling Stones auditioned Gallagher among a number of other guitarists for the band in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Gallagher lived for a time in <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>Gallagher's health and his ability to perform were increasingly compromised by excessive use of alcohol combined with drugs that had been prescribed to alleviate his anxiety of flying. From the late 1980s, he suffered increasingly poor health yet he continued touring. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>, he was visibly unwell. A <a href="Liver_transplantation" title="wikilink">liver transplant</a> became necessary and was nearly successful, but just before being discharged from the hospital, a <a href="Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus" title="wikilink">MRSA</a> developed. He quickly worsened and died in London on 14 June 1995. Gallagher never married and had no children.</p>

<h3 id="rorys-stratocaster">Rory's Stratocaster</h3>
<p><img src="Rory_Gallagher_Stratocaster.jpg" title="fig:Fender&#39;s Rory Gallagher signature model." alt="Fender&#39;s Rory Gallagher signature model." width="100" /> Gallagher was always associated with his well-worn sunburst 1961 <a href="Stratocaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stratocaster</a>, which his brother Donal has officially retired. It was reputedly the first in Ireland, ordered by a <a href="showband" class="uri" title="wikilink">showband</a> member who changed his mind about the colour. Gallagher bought it for just shy of &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 at Crowley's Music Store on <a href="Cork_(city)" title="wikilink">Cork</a>'s McCurtain Street. The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs, for a start, are odd (5 Sperzels and one Gotoh) and all of these have been found to be replacements. Secondly, it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Thirdly, the scratchplate was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Another change was the pickups of which none are original. The final modification was that of the wiring. Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone <a href="potentiometer" title="wikilink">pot</a> and rewired so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He also installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one. The most notable effect that years of touring have had is the almost complete removal of the guitar's sunburst finish, partly through being left out in the rain in a ditch for days after being stolen. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pickup closer to the neck on the bass side and a replacement of all of the pickups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than a perception of a tonal inadequacy. Reproductions of the guitar have recently been sold by <a href="Fender" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fender</a>, though with smaller frets and lower action than the original.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-instruments">Other Instruments</h3>
<p>Gallagher owned a number of other <a href="musical_instrument" title="wikilink">instruments</a>, including:</p>
<p><strong><a href="Coral_sitar" title="wikilink">Coral Sitar</a></strong> Purchased for $2000 in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> by Donal Gallagher. Used on the <a href="song" class="uri" title="wikilink">song</a> &quot;Philby&quot; in 1979.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Danelectro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danelectro</a> Silvertone</strong> This guitar was bought for $15 from a pawnshop. It was often used in Gallagher's live set to play &quot;Cradle Rock&quot; and &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot;.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Fender_Esquire" title="wikilink">Fender Esquire</a></strong> This guitar dating to 1959 was heavily modified. It started off as a stock Esquire in cream and ended up as a black Telecaster. At one point in between, Gallagher put a Strat pickup in the middle position and added a 5-way selector.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Fender_Telecaster" title="wikilink">Fender Telecaster</a> (1967)</strong> This was very similar to the Esquire after the Esquire had undergone all of its modifications. It can be seen in action on Gallagher's <em>Live at <a href="Rockpalast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rockpalast</a></em> <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> in the song &quot;Bullfrog Blues&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Acoustic Guitars</strong> His main acoustic guitar was a <a href="Martin_Guitars" title="wikilink">Martin</a> D-35. In his later years, he used an Electro-Acoustic <a href="Takamine_Guitars" title="wikilink">Takamine</a> (a prototype model given to him by Takamine while he was touring Japan) that was much easier to amplify in a live context.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Mandolin</strong> This was used most famously in Gallagher's joint effort with <a href="Lonnie_Donegan" title="wikilink">Lonnie Donegan</a>, &quot;Goin' To My Hometown&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>National Resonator (1932)</strong> Gallagher used this to play blues standards and acoustic sets and often used a heavy steel slide with it.</p>
<p><strong>Other Instruments</strong> Gallagher also played the <a href="saxophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">saxophone</a>, showcased on the song &quot;On The Boards&quot; by Taste, and <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a> which can be heard on the Taste song &quot;I'm Not Surprised&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="amplifiers-and-effects">Amplifiers and Effects</h3>
<p>Gallagher used various makes and models of amplifiers during his career. In general, however, he preferred smaller 'combo' amplifiers to the larger, more powerful <a href="Marshall_Amplification#Marshall_Stack" title="wikilink">'stacks'</a> that are popular with rock and hard rock guitarists. To make up for the relative lack of power on stage, he would often link several different combo amps together.</p>
<p>When Gallagher was with <a href="Taste_(band)" title="wikilink">Taste</a>, he used a single <a href="Vox_(musical_equipment)" title="wikilink">Vox</a> <a href="Vox_AC30" title="wikilink">AC30</a> with a Dallas Rangemaster <a href="treble_booster_pedal" title="wikilink">treble booster</a> plugged into the 'normal' input. Examples of this sound can be heard on the Taste albums, as well as the album <em>Live in Europe</em>. <a href="Brian_May" title="wikilink">Brian May</a>, of the band <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a>, has admitted in interviews that as a young man, he was inspired to use a similar amplifier and treble booster setup after meeting Gallagher and asking him how he got his sound. Gallagher has also been known to have used <a href="Ibanez_Tube_Screamer" title="wikilink">Ibanez Tube Screamers</a> and various Boss effects.</p>
<p>In the early to mid 1970s, Gallagher began to use <a href="Fender" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fender</a> amplifiers, most notably a Bassman and a Twin, both of a 50s vintage. An example of this sound can be heard on the <em>Irish Tour '74</em> album. He also had a Fender Concert amplifier.</p>
<p>In the mid to late 1970s, when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound, he experimented with <a href="Ampeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ampeg</a> VT40 and VT22 amps. He also began using <a href="Marshall_Amplification" title="wikilink">Marshall</a> combos. During this period and beyond, Gallagher used different combinations of amps on stage to achieve more power and to blend the tonal characteristics of different amps.</p>
