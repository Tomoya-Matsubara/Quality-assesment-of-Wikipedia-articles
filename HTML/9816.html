<h2 id="life-in-england">Life in England</h2>
<p>Hugh Butterworth was the first child of George Montagu Butterworth (12 May 1858 &lt;U+2013&gt; 12 December 1941)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and his wife Catherine (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Warde). After Hugh, five daughters followed. George was a solicitor and a tennis player who reached the semi-finals at <a href="The_Championships,_Wimbledon" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a> in 1880.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Hugh was educated at <a href="Marlborough_College" title="wikilink">Marlborough</a> and at <a href="University_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">University College, Oxford</a>. In mid-May 1906 he played two matches for the university team in 1906 as an opening batsman, then, two days later, one match for <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">MCC</a> against the Oxford team, when he made his highest score, 31.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He also represented Oxford at <a href="Rugby_union" title="wikilink">Rugby union</a>, <a href="field_hockey" title="wikilink">hockey</a> and <a href="Rackets_(sport)" title="wikilink">rackets</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He played several matches for <a href="Wiltshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a> from 1904 to 1906, mostly in the <a href="Minor_Counties_Cricket_Championship" title="wikilink">Minor Counties competition</a>, scoring 122 against <a href="Dorset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Dorset</a> in 1905 and 106 in a victory over MCC in 1906.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A few weeks before Butterworth's final exams in 1907 his family ran into financial difficulties and his father decided to move to New Zealand, where he settled in Cashmere Hills, <a href="Christchurch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christchurch</a>. Hugh and the rest of the family soon joined him, so Hugh was never able to complete his studies.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Hugh took up a position as a master at <a href="Wanganui_Collegiate_School" title="wikilink">Wanganui Collegiate School</a> in September 1907 and remained there until he left to enlist in December 1914. He taught English language and literature, and Latin. Known to the students as &quot;Curly&quot;, he was a much-admired master. One of his students, <a href="Arthur_Porritt,_Baron_Porritt" title="wikilink">Arthur Porritt</a> (who later became Baron Porritt, New Zealand's Governor-General) said, &quot;he was almost automatically loved by every boy who knew him&quot;. Another, Roy Joblin, said, &quot;Butterworth's understanding of the boy must have amounted to genius&quot; and praised &quot;his sportsmanship, his almost permanent good temper, his brilliant wit, his ever accessible sympathy and his love of all that was straight and clean&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Butterworth was phenomenally successful in Saturday afternoon club cricket in <a href="Wanganui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wanganui</a>, scoring four double-centuries and a triple-century.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the early part of the 1914-15 season he scored 296 and 311 in consecutive innings.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He played several non-first-class matches for the Wanganui representative team between 1910 and 1914 and was part of the team that won and held the <a href="Hawke_Cup" title="wikilink">Hawke Cup</a> in 1913-14 and 1914-15. His highest score was 50 (top score in a team total of 203) against South Taranaki in January 1914.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-service-and-death">War service and death</h2>
<p><img src="Plaque,_Deerhurst_Church.jpg" title="fig:Plaque, Deerhurst Church" alt="Plaque, Deerhurst Church" /> He returned to England early in 1915 and joined the <a href="Rifle_Brigade_(Prince_Consort&#39;s_Own)" title="wikilink">Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)</a> as a lieutenant. He was later promoted to the rank of captain. He served in Flanders from May 1915 until he was killed in action in September 1915.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Wanganui Collegiate said in tribute that &quot;his life of unselfish devotion to duty will serve as a pattern for many years to those who had the good fortune to know him&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>His cousin <a href="George_Butterworth" title="wikilink">George Butterworth</a>, the composer, also died in action in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. George's father had a plaque in their memory placed in <a href="Deerhurst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deerhurst</a> church, <a href="Gloucestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a>.</p>
<p>A book of his letters from the front, <em>Letters from Flanders</em>, was published in New Zealand in 1916. It was re-published as <em>Blood and Iron</em> in 2011 by Pen &amp; Sword, with a biographical introduction by the military historian Jon Cooksey.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
