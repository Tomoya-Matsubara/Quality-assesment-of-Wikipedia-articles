Lexie forms a friendship with fellow intern <a href="George_O&#39;Malley" title="wikilink">George O'Malley</a> (<a href="T.R._Knight" title="wikilink">T.R.

<p>Lexie develops a romantic relationship with <a href="plastic_surgery" title="wikilink">plastic surgeon</a> <a href="Mark_Sloan_(Grey&#39;s_Anatomy)" title="wikilink">Mark Sloan</a> (<a href="Eric_Dane" title="wikilink">Eric Dane</a>), despite the efforts of Meredith and her husband, <a href="Derek_Shepherd" title="wikilink">Derek Shepherd</a> (<a href="Patrick_Dempsey" title="wikilink">Patrick Dempsey</a>), as they feel he will hurt her. In the sixth season, O'Malley dies, after injuries sustained while being dragged by a bus, and Lexie receives comfort from Sloan, by moving in with him.

After constant pleads from Lexie, Meredith unwillingly agrees to donate her liver to Thatcher. In &quot;Holidaze&quot;, Sloan's daughter shows up at their apartment, seeking kinship with him. His daughter soon announces her pregnancy, and Sloan offers shelter for her and the baby. However, when Lexie finds out, she is piqued that Sloan did not discuss this with her, and the two break up.

Karev cannot deal with this, and ends his relationship with Lexie, leaving her enraged. Their breakup is followed by Lexie returning to Sloan, who condemned Karev for leaving her. However, Lexie later discovers that during their breakup, Sloan impregnated <a href="orthopedic_surgery" title="wikilink">orthopedic surgeon</a> <a href="Callie_Torres" title="wikilink">Callie Torres</a> (<a href="Sara_Ramirez" title="wikilink">Sara Ramirez</a>), and she ends their relationship, again.

In season eight, Lexie becomes jealous of Sloan's new girlfriend, Julia, which leads to Avery breaking up with her. Thereafter, Lexie confesses her undying love to Sloan, only to be ignored. In &quot;<a href="Flight_(Grey&#39;s_Anatomy)" title="wikilink">Flight</a>&quot;, however, Lexie, Sloan, Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, and <a href="pediatric_surgery" title="wikilink">pediatric suregon</a> <a href="Arizona_Robbins" title="wikilink">Arizona Robbins</a> (<a href="Jessica_Capshaw" title="wikilink">Jessica Capshaw</a>), are involved in an <a href="aviation_accident" title="wikilink">aviation accident</a>, crushing Lexie under debris.

<p>Leigh first appeared on the show during the last two episodes of the third season as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie Grey. Following <a href="Isaiah_Washington" title="wikilink">Isaiah Washington</a>'s departure, who portrayed <a href="Preston_Burke" title="wikilink">Preston Burke</a>, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for the fourth season.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> On casting Chyler Leigh as Lexie, <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> creator Shonda Rhimes said: &quot;We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out&lt;U+2014&gt;she had a quality that felt right and real to me. It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 2012, Leigh requested an extended summer hiatus, in order to spend more time with her family. This was granted by Rhimes, though the actress returned in mid-October.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Leigh's character died in the eighth season finale. In May 2012, Rhimes revealed why she decided to have Lexie die: &quot;I love Chyler and I love the character of Lexie Grey. She was an important member of my Grey's family. This was not an easy decision. But it was a decision that Chyler and I came to together. We had a lot of thoughtful discussion about it and ultimately we both decided this was the right time for her character's journey to end. As far as I'm concerned Chyler will always remain a part of the Shondaland family and I can't wait to work with her again in the future.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Following the death of her character, Leigh released a statement saying: </p>
<h3 id="characterization">Characterization</h3>

<p>Leigh's character has been called &quot;reliable, trustworthy, timid, and apprehensive&quot; by <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> executives. In her early appearances, it was learned that Lexie has a <a href="photographic_memory" title="wikilink">photographic memory</a>, which she applied to her surgical career.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This led her to being nicknamed &quot;Lexipedia&quot; by Alex Karev.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The character has also been described as an &quot;innocent young intern&quot; by Alex Keen of <em>The Trades</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><img src="JustinChambersMay09.jpg" title="fig:Debbie Chang noted the culpability taken by Lexie, while Karev (Justin Chambers) was mistreating her." alt="Debbie Chang noted the culpability taken by Lexie, while Karev (Justin Chambers) was mistreating her." width="180" /> Of the character, Leigh said: &quot;She's a very vulnerable person from a very healthy background&lt;U+2014&gt;she knows how to make good relationships but at this point [season four], she's coming into so much opposition she's trying to adjust to it.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Debbie Chang of <em><a href="BuddyTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">BuddyTV</a></em> commented on Lexie's early characterization, including her sexual relationship with Karev: </p>
<p>Similarities have been established between Lexie and her half-sister, Meredith. Series writer, Stacy McKee, commented on this: </p>
<p>Lexie entertained several relationships throughout her time on <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>. In her early appearances, she maintained a friendship with George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: &quot;I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere &lt;U+2013&gt; we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That&lt;U+2019&gt;s Lexie and George. They&lt;U+2019&gt;re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that&lt;U+2019&gt;s what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy because he is a GOOD guy and that&lt;U+2019&gt;s what George is. He is a good guy and that&lt;U+2019&gt;s something that Lexie could use now. She&lt;U+2019&gt;s going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m rooting for Lexie. She&lt;U+2019&gt;s my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: </p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The character's transition from season four to five has been positively reviewed, with Keen of <em>The Trades</em> writing: &quot;Her presence and confidence have increased quite a bit since last season, and actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making this progression feel seamless. Since the series has defused the tension between Little Grey and Big Grey (aka Meredith), Lexie has clear sailing through the season and steals the show as one of the best current characters on the series.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
