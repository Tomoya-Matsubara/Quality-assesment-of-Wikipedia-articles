<p>With the commencement of the First World War in 1914 he was mobilised to participate in the campaign against Germany and Austria and was assigned as a staff officer to the headquarters of the XXIII Corps of the Imperial Russian Army. Later he was sent to the Nikolaev Cavalry School in Petrograd where he underwent higher officer training. In 1916 he was sent to Main Artillery Control Headquarters and was made Commander of the 1st Artillery Squadron.

<p>In November 1917 he left the Russian Army and briefly became an officer into the Polish 1st Corp. After the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty and the subsequent dissolution of the Corps in May 1918 he made his way via Murmansk to France to join the emergent independent Polish Army (Haller's Army).</p>
<p>He joined the Polish 1st Tank Regiment (1 Pulk Czolgow) which was newly equipped with 120 of the small but relatively fast Renault FT-17 tanks. The 1st Tank Regiment consisted of four tank companies organised into two Battalions. After initial training on the new tanks, he first commenced as the Technical Adjutant to the I Battalion but shortly after on December 18, 1919 was promoted and took over Command of the 2nd Company from its previous French Commander, one Captain Dufour. In 1920 he was involved in a great deal of fierce fighting particularly in the evacuation from Wilno and the Defense of Grodno. On August 12, 1920 he was promoted to Major and became Commander of the II Battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment, taking over from Captain Henryk Romiszowski. In 1921 he became the first ever Polish tank officer or crew member to receive the Virtuti Militari the decoration &quot;for outstanding bravery in combat&quot; was awarded for his actions during and subsequent to the Defense of Grodno. He was wounded in action and later also received the Polish Cross of Valour.</p>
<p>With the formal ending of the Polish-Soviet war in 1921 he retired from his command of the II Battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment and recommenced in his career as an engineer being responsible for the building a number of bridges and other civil works. He died from a heart attack on February 5, 1929 at only 48 years of age.</p>
