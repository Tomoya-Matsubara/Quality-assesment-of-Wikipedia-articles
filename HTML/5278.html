<p><strong>Ion Heliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu</strong> or <strong>Ion Heliade</strong> (also known as <em>Eliad</em> or <em>Eliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu</em>; ; January 6, 1802&lt;U+2013&gt;April 27, 1872) was a <a href="Wallachia" title="wikilink">Wallachian</a>-born <a href="Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian</a> academic, <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> and <a href="Classicism" title="wikilink">Classicist</a> poet, essayist, memoirist, short story writer, newspaper editor and politician. A prolific translator of foreign literature into <a href="Romanian_language" title="wikilink">Romanian</a>, he was also the author of books on <a href="linguistics" class="uri" title="wikilink">linguistics</a> and history. For much of his life, Heliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu was a teacher at <a href="Saint_Sava_College" title="wikilink">Saint Sava College</a> in <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>, which he helped reopen. He was a founding member and first president of the <a href="Romanian_Academy" title="wikilink">Romanian Academy</a>.</p>
<p>Heliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu is considered one of the foremost champions of <a href="Romanian_culture" title="wikilink">Romanian culture</a> from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with <a href="Gheorghe_Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r" title="wikilink">Gheorghe Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r</a> and his support of Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r's drive for discontinuing education in <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> <a href="neologism" title="wikilink">neologisms</a> into the <a href="Romanian_lexis" title="wikilink">Romanian lexis</a>. A <a href="Romantic_nationalism" title="wikilink">Romantic nationalist</a> landowner siding with moderate <a href="Liberalism_and_radicalism_in_Romania" title="wikilink">liberals</a>, Heliade was among the leaders of the <a href="1848_Wallachian_revolution" title="wikilink">1848 Wallachian revolution</a>, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of <a href="conservatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">conservatism</a>, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic <a href="boyar" title="wikilink">boyars</a> in <a href="History_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian history</a>, he was rewarded for supporting the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> and clashed with the <a href="Radicalism_(historical)" title="wikilink">radical</a> wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.</p>

<p>After basic education in Greek with a <a href="tutor" class="uri" title="wikilink">tutor</a> known as Alexe, Ion Heliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu taught himself reading in <a href="Romanian_Cyrillic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Romanian Cyrillic</a> (reportedly by studying the <em><a href="Alexander_Romance" title="wikilink">Alexander Romance</a></em> with the help of his father's <a href="Oltenia" title="wikilink">Oltenian</a> servants).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in G&lt;U+00E2&gt;rbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by <em><a href="Caragea&#39;s_plague" title="wikilink">Caragea's plague</a></em>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> After 1813, the teenaged R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu was a pupil of the <a href="Romanian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> monk <a href="Naum_R&lt;U+00E2&gt;mniceanu" title="wikilink">Naum R&lt;U+00E2&gt;mniceanu</a>; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at <a href="Schitu_M&lt;U+0103&gt;gureanu" title="wikilink">Schitu M&lt;U+0103&gt;gureanu</a>, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the <a href="Saint_Sava_College" title="wikilink">Saint Sava School</a>, where he studied under Gheorghe Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r's supervision.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1822, after Gheorghe Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r had fallen ill, Heliade reopened Saint Sava and served as its main teacher (initially, without any form of remuneration).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He was later joined in this effort by other <a href="intellectual" title="wikilink">intellectuals</a> of the day, such as <a href="Eufrosin_Poteca" title="wikilink">Eufrosin Poteca</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and, eventually, also opened an art class overseen by the <a href="Croats" title="wikilink">Croat</a> <a href="Carol_Val&lt;U+015F&gt;tain" title="wikilink">Carol Val&lt;U+015F&gt;tain</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This re-establishment came as a result of ordinances issued by <a href="List_of_rulers_of_Wallachia" title="wikilink">Prince</a> <a href="Grigore_IV_Ghica" title="wikilink">Grigore IV Ghica</a>, who had just been assigned by the Ottoman Empire to the throne of Wallachia upon the disestablishment of <a href="Phanariotes" title="wikilink">Phanariote</a> rule, encouraging the marginalization of <a href="Greeks_in_Romania" title="wikilink">ethnic Greeks</a> who had assumed public office in previous decades.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Thus, Prince Ghica had endorsed education in Romanian and, in one of his official <em><a href="firman_(decree)" title="wikilink">firmans</a></em>, defined teaching in Greek as &quot;the foundation of evils&quot; (<em>temelia r&lt;U+0103&gt;ut&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+0163&gt;ilor</em>).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>During the late 1820s, Heliade became involved in cultural policies. In 1827, he and <a href="Dinicu_Golescu" title="wikilink">Dinicu Golescu</a> founded <em>So&lt;U+0163&gt;ietatea literar&lt;U+0103&gt; rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt;</em> (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a <a href="college" class="uri" title="wikilink">college</a>, the opening of another such institution in <a href="Craiova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Craiova</a>, and the creation of schools in virtually all Wallachian localities.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In addition, <em>So&lt;U+0163&gt;ietatea</em> attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling for an end to the state monopoly on <a href="printing_press" title="wikilink">printing presses</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's <a href="Calea_Victoriei" title="wikilink">Podul Mogo&lt;U+015F&gt;oaiei</a>, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, <a href="Gheorghe_Bibescu" title="wikilink">Gheorghe Bibescu</a> and <a href="Barbu_Dimitrie_&lt;U+015E&gt;tirbei" title="wikilink">Barbu Dimitrie &lt;U+015E&gt;tirbei</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Its character was based on <a href="Freemasonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freemasonry</a>;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1828, Heliade published his first work, an essay on <a href="Romanian_grammar" title="wikilink">Romanian grammar</a>, in the <a href="Transylvania" title="wikilink">Transylvanian</a> city of <a href="Sibiu" title="wikilink">Hermannstadt</a> (which was part of the <a href="Austrian_Empire" title="wikilink">Austrian Empire</a> at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper <em><a href="Curierul_Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc" title="wikilink">Curierul Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc</a></em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Publishing articles in both Romanian and <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, <em>Curierul Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc</em> had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of <em><a href="Curier_de_Ambe_Sexe" title="wikilink">Curier de Ambe Sexe</a></em>; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, <em><a href="Zbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul</a></em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <em>Curierul Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nesc</em> was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three or four times a week.

<p>In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, with whom he fell passionately in love, and whom he later married.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> By 1830, the Heliades' two children, a son named Virgiliu and a daughter named Virgilia, died in infancy; subsequently, their marriage entered a long period of crisis, marked by Maria's frequent outbursts of jealousy.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Ion Heliade probably had a number of extramarital affairs: a <a href="Wallachian_military_forces" title="wikilink">Wallachian Militia</a> officer named Zalic, who became known during the 1840s, is thought by some, including the literary critic <a href="George_C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu" title="wikilink">George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu</a>, to have been the writer's illegitimate son.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Before the death of her first child, Maria Heliade welcomed into her house Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a celebrated writer, whom Ion suspected had become her lover.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Consequently, the two authors became bitter rivals: Ion Heliade referred to Alexandrescu as &quot;that ingrate&quot;, and, in an 1838 letter to <a href="George_Bari&lt;U+0163&gt;" title="wikilink">George Bari&lt;U+0163&gt;</a>, downplayed his poetry and character (believing that, in one of his <a href="fable" title="wikilink">fables</a>, Alexandrescu had depicted himself as a <a href="nightingale" class="uri" title="wikilink">nightingale</a>, he commented that, in reality, he was &quot;a piteous <a href="Rook_(bird)" title="wikilink">rook</a> dressed in foreign feathers&quot;).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Despite these household conflicts, Maria Heliade gave birth to five other children, four daughters and one son (Ion, born 1846).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Heliade's most influential contributions are related to his interest in developing the modern <a href="Romanian_language" title="wikilink">Romanian language</a>, in which he synthesized <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> tenets and <a href="Romantic_nationalism" title="wikilink">Romantic nationalist</a> ideals of the 1848 generation.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> At a time when Romanian was being discarded by the educated in favor of <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> or <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, he and his supporters argued in favor of adapting Romanian to the requirements of <a href="modernization" class="uri" title="wikilink">modernization</a>; he wrote: &quot;Young people, preoccupy yourselves with the national language, speak and write in it; prepare yourselves for its study, for its cultivation, &lt;U+2014&gt; and cultivating a language means to write in it about all sciences and arts, about all eras and peoples.

<p>Heliade inaugurated his series of proposals for reforming the language in 1828, when his work on <a href="Romanian_grammar" title="wikilink">Romanian grammar</a> called for the <a href="Romanian_Cyrillic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Cyrillic script</a> to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting <a href="phonetic_spelling" title="wikilink">phonetic spelling</a> (for this rule, Heliade cited the example of the <a href="Latin_alphabet" title="wikilink">Latin alphabet</a> as used in <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Ancient Rome</a>).<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing <a href="Romance_languages" title="wikilink">Romance</a> <a href="neologism" title="wikilink">neologisms</a>, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the <a href="Romanian_dialects" title="wikilink">varieties of Romanian</a> and create a standard <a href="Romanian_lexis" title="wikilink">Romanian lexis</a>: this notion was first supported by the <a href="Transylvania" title="wikilink">Transylvanians</a> <a href="Gheorghe_&lt;U+015E&gt;incai" title="wikilink">Gheorghe &lt;U+015E&gt;incai</a> and <a href="Petru_Maior" title="wikilink">Petru Maior</a>, whose proposal was to unite Romanian around the language used in church services, both <a href="Romanian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> and <a href="Romanian_Church_United_with_Rome,_Greek-Catholic" title="wikilink">Greek-Catholic</a> (<em>see <a href="Transylvanian_School" title="wikilink">Transylvanian School</a></em>).<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Heliade, who first proposed a <a href="Standard_language" title="wikilink">language regulator</a> (an idea which was to be employed in creating the <a href="Romanian_Academy" title="wikilink">Romanian Academy</a>), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in <a href="Muntenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muntenia</a>, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer <a href="Coresi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coresi</a>, serve as the standard language.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, he advocated <a href="Aesthetics" title="wikilink">aesthetical</a> guidelines in respect to the standard shape of Romanian, stressing three basic principles in selecting words: &quot;proper wording&quot;, which called for <a href="vernacular" class="uri" title="wikilink">vernacular</a> words of <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> origin to be prioritized; &quot;harmony&quot;, which meant that words of Latin origin were to be used in their most popular form, even in cases where <a href="Phonaesthetics" title="wikilink">euphony</a> had been altered by prolonged usage; and &quot;energy&quot;, through which Heliade favored the primacy of the shortest and most expressive of <a href="synonym" title="wikilink">synonyms</a> used throughout Romanian-speaking areas.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In parallel, Heliade frowned upon <a href="Linguistic_purism" title="wikilink">purist</a> policies of removing widely-used neologisms of foreign origin &lt;U+2014&gt; arguing that these were &quot;a fatality&quot;, he indicated that the gains of such a process would have been shadowed by the losses.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>These early theories exercised a lasting influence, and, when the work of unifying Romanian was accomplished in the late 19th century, they were used as a source of inspiration: Romania's major poet of the period, <a href="Mihai_Eminescu" title="wikilink">Mihai Eminescu</a>, himself celebrated for having created the modern <a href="literary_language" title="wikilink">literary language</a>, gave praise to Heliade for &quot;writing just as [the language] is spoken&quot;.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> This assessment was shared by <a href="Ovid_Densusianu" title="wikilink">Ovid Densusianu</a>, who wrote: &quot;Thinking of how people wrote back then, in thick, drawly, sleepy phrases, Heliade thus shows himself superior to all his contemporaries, and &lt;U+2026&gt; we can consider him the first prose writer who brings in the note of <a href="History_of_modern_literature" title="wikilink">modernity</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="italian-influence">Italian influence</h3>
<p>A second period in Heliade's linguistic researches, inaugurated when he adopted <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne_Bonnot_de_Condillac" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne Condillac</a>'s theory that a language could be developed from conventions, eventually brought about the rejection of his own earlier views.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> By the early 1840s, he postulated that Romanian and <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> were not distinct languages, but rather dialects of Latin, which prompted him to declare the necessity of replacing Romanian words with &quot;superior&quot; Italian ones.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> One of his <a href="stanza" title="wikilink">stanzas</a>, using his version of the <a href="Romanian_alphabet" title="wikilink">Romanian Latin alphabet</a>, read:</p>

<p>Celebrated as the founder of Wallachian <a href="Romanticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romanticism</a>, Heliade was equally influenced by <a href="Classicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Classicism</a> and the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Age of Enlightenment</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> His work, written in a special cultural context (where Classiciasm and Romanticism coexisted), took the middle path between two opposing camps: the Romantics (<a href="Alecu_Russo" title="wikilink">Alecu Russo</a>, <a href="Mihail_Kog&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu" title="wikilink">Mihail Kog&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu</a> and others) and the Classicists (<a href="Gheorghe_Asachi" title="wikilink">Gheorghe Asachi</a>, <a href="Grigore_Alexandrescu" title="wikilink">Grigore Alexandrescu</a>, <a href="George_Baronzi" title="wikilink">George Baronzi</a> etc.).<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> <a href="George_C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu" title="wikilink">George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu</a> defined Heliade as &quot;a devourer of books&quot;, noting that his favorites, who all played a part in shaping his style and were many times the subject of his translations, included: <a href="Alphonse_de_Lamartine" title="wikilink">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>, <a href="Dante_Aligheri" title="wikilink">Dante Aligheri</a>, <a href="Ludovico_Ariosto" title="wikilink">Ludovico Ariosto</a>, <a href="Torquato_Tasso" title="wikilink">Torquato Tasso</a>, <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a>, <a href="Jean-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Marmontel" title="wikilink">Jean-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Marmontel</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, and <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Chateaubriand" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Chateaubriand</a>.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>His poetic style, influenced from early on by Lamartine, was infused with Classicism during his middle age, before he again adopted Romantic tenets.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Initially making use of guidelines set by <a href="Nicolas_Boileau-Despr&lt;U+00E9&gt;aux" title="wikilink">Nicolas Boileau-Despr&lt;U+00E9&gt;aux</a> in respect to poetry, he came to oppose them after reading <a href="Victor_Hugo" title="wikilink">Victor Hugo</a>'s Romantic preface to <em><a href="Cromwell_(play)" title="wikilink">Cromwell</a></em> (without ever discarding them altogether).<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Like the Classicists, Heliade favored a literature highlighting &quot;types&quot; of characters, as the union of universal traits and particular characteristics, but, like the Romantics, he encouraged writers to write from a <a href="Subjectivism" title="wikilink">subjective</a> viewpoint, which he believed to be indicative of their mission as &quot;prophets, &lt;U+2026&gt; men who criticize, who point out their society's plagues and who look on to a happier future, waiting for a savior&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Through the latter ideal of moral regeneration, Heliade also complimented the Romantic stress on &quot;national specificity&quot;, which he adopted in his later years.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> At the same time, he centered much of his own literary work on non-original material, either by compiling it from various translations or by translating from a single source &lt;U+2014&gt; having his focus on creating the basis for further development by introducing samples of untapped <a href="literary_genre" title="wikilink">literary genres</a> and styles to <a href="Literature_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian literature</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>An 1837 essay of his, centered on a debate regarding the translation of <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: &quot;This is not the time for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer.

<p>Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main interests was an investigation into the issues involving Romanian history during the <a href="origin_of_the_Romanians" title="wikilink">origin of the Romanians</a> and the <a href="Romania_in_the_Early_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">early medieval history</a> of the <a href="Danubian_Principalities" title="wikilink">Danubian Principalities</a>.

<p>The ideal he expressed in a work of the period, <em>Equilibru &lt;U+00EE&gt;ntre antithesi</em> (&quot;A Balance between <a href="Antithesis" title="wikilink">Antitheses</a>&quot;) was moderate <a href="progressivism" class="uri" title="wikilink">progressivism</a>, with the preservation of social peace.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> In <a href="Tudor_Vianu" title="wikilink">Tudor Vianu</a>'s view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, <em>Equilibru</em>, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="wikilink">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>'s thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of <a href="Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="wikilink">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Nonetheless, his system parted with <a href="Hegelianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hegelianism</a> in that, instead of seeking a balance between the <em><a href="Geist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geist</a></em> and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (<em><a href="Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis" title="wikilink">Thesis, antithesis, synthesis</a></em>) the reflection of a <a href="Numerology" title="wikilink">mystical number</a> favored throughout history.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>

<p>During the early 1880s, <a href="Alexandru_Macedonski" title="wikilink">Alexandru Macedonski</a> and his <em><a href="Literatorul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Literatorul</a></em> attempted to preserve Heliade's status and his theories when these were faced with criticism from <em>Junimea</em>; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, and contributed to the disestablishment of <em>Literatorul</em>.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Although a <em>Junimist</em> for a large part of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a precursor in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the <a href="Conservative_Party_(Romania,_1880&lt;U+2013&gt;1918)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a>'s main journal, <em><a href="Epoca_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Epoca</a></em>.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher <a href="Marius_Chico&lt;U+015F&gt;_Rostogan" title="wikilink">Marius Chico&lt;U+015F&gt; Rostogan</a>, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade R&lt;U+0103&gt;dulescu, <a href="Ion_C&lt;U+00E2&gt;mpineanu" title="wikilink">Ion C&lt;U+00E2&gt;mpineanu</a>, and <a href="Nicolae_B&lt;U+0103&gt;lcescu" title="wikilink">Nicolae B&lt;U+0103&gt;lcescu</a>, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around <a href="Pantazi_Ghica" title="wikilink">Pantazi Ghica</a>, <a href="Nicolae_Misail" title="wikilink">Nicolae Misail</a> and <a href="Mihail_P&lt;U+0103&gt;t&lt;U+00E2&gt;rl&lt;U+0103&gt;geanu" title="wikilink">Mihail P&lt;U+0103&gt;t&lt;U+00E2&gt;rl&lt;U+0103&gt;geanu</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; he identified the latter grouping with <a href="hypocrisy" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypocrisy</a>, <a href="demagogy" class="uri" title="wikilink">demagogy</a>, and <a href="political_corruption" title="wikilink">political corruption</a>, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>
