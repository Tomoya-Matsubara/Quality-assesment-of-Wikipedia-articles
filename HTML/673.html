<p><strong>Jesus</strong> (; ; 7&lt;U+2013&gt;2 BC to 30&lt;U+2013&gt;33 AD), also referred to as <strong>Jesus of Nazareth</strong>, is the central figure of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, whom the teachings of most <a href="Christian_denominations" title="wikilink">Christian denominations</a> hold to be the <a href="Son_of_God" title="wikilink">Son of God</a>. Christians believe Jesus to be the awaited <a href="Messiah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Messiah</a> of the <a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a> and refer to him as <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, a name that is also used by some non-Christians.</p>
<p>Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that a <a href="Historicity_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">historical Jesus existed</a>, although <a href="quest_for_the_historical_Jesus" title="wikilink">there is little agreement</a> on the <a href="Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels" title="wikilink">reliability of the gospel narratives</a> and their assertions of his divinity. Most scholars agree that Jesus was a <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> preacher from <a href="Galilee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galilee</a>, <a href="Baptism_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">was baptized</a> by <a href="John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">John the Baptist</a>, and <a href="Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">was crucified</a> in <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a> on the orders of the <a href="Roman_governor" title="wikilink">Roman prefect</a>, <a href="Pontius_Pilate" title="wikilink">Pontius Pilate</a>. Scholars have constructed various portraits of the <a href="historical_Jesus" title="wikilink">historical Jesus</a>, which often depict him as having one or more of the following roles: the leader of an <a href="apocalypticism" title="wikilink">apocalyptic</a> movement, Messiah, a charismatic healer, a sage and philosopher, or an <a href="egalitarianism" title="wikilink">egalitarian</a> <a href="social_reform" title="wikilink">social reformer</a>. Scholars have correlated the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a> accounts with non-Christian historical records to arrive at an estimated <a href="Chronology_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">chronology of Jesus' life</a>.</p>
<p>Christians believe that Jesus was conceived by the <a href="Holy_Spirit_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">Holy Spirit</a>, <a href="Virgin_birth_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">born of a virgin</a>, performed <a href="Miracles_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">miracles</a>, founded <a href="Christian_Church" title="wikilink">the Church</a>, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve <a href="Atonement_in_Christianity" title="wikilink">atonement</a>, <a href="Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">rose from the dead</a>, and <a href="Ascension_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">ascended</a> into <a href="Heaven_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">heaven</a>, from which he <a href="Second_Coming" title="wikilink">will return</a>. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of <a href="God_the_Son" title="wikilink">God the Son</a>, the second of three Persons of a <a href="Trinity" title="wikilink">Divine Trinity</a>. A few Christian groups <a href="Nontrinitarianism" title="wikilink">reject Trinitarianism</a>, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.</p>
<p><a href="Jesus_in_Islam" title="wikilink">In Islam</a>, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ) is considered one of <a href="God_in_Islam" title="wikilink">God's</a> important <a href="Prophets_of_Islam" title="wikilink">prophets</a>. To Muslims, Jesus is a <a href="Prophets_and_messengers_in_Islam" title="wikilink">bringer of scripture</a> and the child of a virgin birth, but neither divine nor the victim of crucifixion. Judaism <a href="Jewish_views_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">rejects</a> the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill the <a href="Jewish_messiah" title="wikilink">Messianic prophecies</a> in the <a href="Tanakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanakh</a>. </p>
<h2 id="etymology-of-names">Etymology of names</h2>

<p>A typical <a href="Jews" title="wikilink">Jew</a> in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes supplemented with the father's name or the individual's hometown.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus, in the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a>, Jesus is referred to as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#26:71" title="wikilink">Matthew 26:71</a>), &quot;Joseph's son&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#4:22" title="wikilink">Luke 4:22</a>), and &quot;Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#1:45" title="wikilink">John 1:45</a>). However, in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:3" title="wikilink">Mark 6:3</a>, rather than being called the son of Joseph, he is referred to as &quot;the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon&quot;. The name <em>Jesus</em>, which occurs in several languages, is derived from the Latin <em>Iesus</em>, a <a href="transliteration" class="uri" title="wikilink">transliteration</a> of the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>  (<em></em>).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Greek form is a rendition of the <a href="Aramaic_language" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a>  (<em>Yeshua</em>), which is derived from the <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>  (<em>Yehoshua</em>).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The name <em>Yeshua</em> appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The first-century works of historian <a href="Flavius_Josephus" title="wikilink">Flavius Josephus</a> refer to at least twenty different people with this name. The etymology of Jesus' name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot;.</p>
<p>Since early Christianity, Christians have commonly referred to Jesus as &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. The word <em><a href="Christ" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christ</a></em> is derived from the Greek  (<em>Christos</em>),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> which is a translation of the Hebrew  (<em></em>), meaning the &quot;<a href="anointing" title="wikilink">anointed</a>&quot; and usually transliterated into English as &quot;<a href="Messiah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Messiah</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Christians designate Jesus as Christ because they believe he is the awaited Messiah <a href="Jesus_and_messianic_prophecy" title="wikilink">prophesied</a> in the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a> (<a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a>).

<p>Most scholars agree that Jesus was a <a href="Galilee" title="wikilink">Galilean</a> Jew, born around the beginning of the first century, who died between 30 and 36 AD in <a href="Judea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judea</a>. The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of <a href="John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">John the Baptist</a> and was crucified by Roman governor <a href="Pontius_Pilate" title="wikilink">Pontius Pilate</a>, who reigned from 26 to 36 AD. Most scholars hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus' birth. <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#2:1" title="wikilink">Matthew 2:1</a> associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of <a href="Herod_the_Great" title="wikilink">Herod the Great</a>, who died around 4 BC, and <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#1:5" title="wikilink">Luke 1:5</a> mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus, although this gospel also associates the birth with the <a href="Census_of_Quirinius" title="wikilink">Census of Quirinius</a> which took place ten years later. <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:23" title="wikilink">Luke 3:23</a> states that Jesus was &quot;about thirty years old&quot; at the start of his <a href="ministry_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">ministry</a>, which according to <a href="wikisource:Bible_(American_Standard)/Acts#10:37" title="wikilink">Acts 10:37&lt;U+2013&gt;38</a> was preceded by John's ministry, itself recorded in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:1" title="wikilink">Luke 3:1&lt;U+2013&gt;2</a> to have begun in the 15th year of <a href="Tiberius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiberius</a>' reign (28 or 29 AD).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC for Jesus,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range.</p>
<p>The years of Jesus' ministry have been estimated using several different approaches. One of these applies the reference in <a href="wikisource:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:1" title="wikilink">Luke 3:1&lt;U+2013&gt;2</a>, <a href="wikisource:Bible_(American_Standard)/Acts#10:37" title="wikilink">Acts 10:37&lt;U+2013&gt;38</a> and the dates of Tiberius' reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28&lt;U+2013&gt;29 AD for the start of Jesus' ministry. Another approach uses the statement about the temple in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#2:13" title="wikilink">John 2:13&lt;U+2013&gt;20</a>, which asserts that the <a href="Jerusalem_Temple" title="wikilink">temple in Jerusalem</a> was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus' ministry, together with <a href="wikisource:The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XV" title="wikilink">Josephus' statement</a> that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign, to estimate a date around 27&lt;U+2013&gt;29 AD. A further method uses the date of the <a href="death_of_John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">death of John the Baptist</a> and the marriage of <a href="Herod_Antipas" title="wikilink">Herod Antipas</a> to <a href="Herodias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodias</a>, based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#14:4" title="wikilink">Matthew 14:4</a> and <a href="wikisource:Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:18" title="wikilink">Mark 6:18</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28&lt;U+2013&gt;35, this yields a date about 28&lt;U+2013&gt;29 AD.</p>
<p>A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the <a href="Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>. Most scholars agree that he died between 30 and 33 AD.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The date for the <a href="conversion_of_Paul" title="wikilink">conversion of Paul</a> (estimated to be 33&lt;U+2013&gt;36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion.

<p>The canonical gospels are four accounts, each written by a different author. The first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written 60&lt;U+2013&gt;75 AD), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (65&lt;U+2013&gt;85 AD), the Gospel of Luke (65&lt;U+2013&gt;95 AD), and the Gospel of John (75&lt;U+2013&gt;100 AD).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> They often differ in content and in the ordering of events.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Three of them, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the <a href="Synoptic_Gospels" title="wikilink">Synoptic Gospels</a>, from the Greek &lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; (<em>syn</em> &quot;together&quot;) and &lt;U+1F44&gt;&lt;U+03C8&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; (<em>opsis</em> &quot;view&quot;).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> They are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>While the flow of some events, such as Jesus' <a href="Baptism_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">baptism</a>, <a href="Transfiguration_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Transfiguration</a>, Crucifixion and interactions with the Apostles, are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the Transfiguration do not appear in John's Gospel, which also differs on other matters, such as the <a href="Cleansing_of_the_Temple" title="wikilink">Cleansing of the Temple</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke <a href="Markan_priority" title="wikilink">used Mark as a source</a> when writing their gospels. Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark. To explain this, many scholars believe that in addition to Mark, another source (commonly called the &quot;<a href="Q_source" title="wikilink">Q source</a>&quot;) was used by the two authors.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#21:25" title="wikilink">John 21:25</a>, the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of <a href="early_Christianity" title="wikilink">early Christianity</a>, with timelines as a secondary consideration.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> One manifestation of the gospels as theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a>, referred to as <a href="Passion_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">the Passion</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The gospels include a number of discourses by Jesus on specific occasions, such as the <a href="Sermon_on_the_Mount" title="wikilink">Sermon on the Mount</a> and the <a href="Farewell_Discourse" title="wikilink">Farewell Discourse</a>.

Outside the New Testament, documents exist that are more or less contemporary with Jesus and the gospels, but few shed any light on biographical details of his life, and these two gospel accounts remain the main sources of information on the genealogy and Nativity.</p>
<p>Matthew <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#1:1" title="wikilink">begins his gospel</a> with the genealogy of Jesus, before giving an account of Jesus' birth. He traces Jesus' ancestry to Abraham through David. <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:23" title="wikilink">Luke 3:22</a> discusses the genealogy after describing the baptism of Jesus, when the voice from Heaven addresses Jesus and identifies him as the <a href="Son_of_God" title="wikilink">Son of God</a>.

<p>The Nativity is a prominent element in the Gospel of Luke, comprising over 10 percent of the text and being three times as long as Matthew's Nativity text.

<p>The gospels present John the Baptist's ministry as the precursor of that of Jesus. Starting with his baptism, Jesus begins his ministry in the countryside of Judea, near the River Jordan, when he is &quot;about thirty years old&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:23" title="wikilink">Luke 3:23</a>). He then travels, preaches and performs miracles, eventually completing his ministry with the Last Supper with his disciples in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus <a href="Commissioning_of_the_Twelve_Apostles" title="wikilink">appoints twelve apostles</a>. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#4:18" title="wikilink">Matthew 4:18&lt;U+2013&gt;22</a>, <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#1:16" title="wikilink">Mark 1:16&lt;U+2013&gt;20</a>). In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the <a href="Lamb_of_God" title="wikilink">Lamb of God</a>; the two hear this and follow Jesus. In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the <a href="Sermon_on_the_Plain" title="wikilink">Sermon on the Plain</a> identifies a much larger group of people as disciples (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#6:17" title="wikilink">Luke 6:17</a>). Also, in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#10:1" title="wikilink">Luke 10:1&lt;U+2013&gt;16</a> Jesus sends <a href="Seventy_disciples" title="wikilink">seventy or seventy-two of his followers</a> in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of <a href="Satan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satan</a>. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#4:18" title="wikilink">Matthew 4:18&lt;U+2013&gt;20</a>, <a href="first_disciples_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">his first disciples</a>, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> as well as the <a href="calming_the_storm" title="wikilink">calming of the storm</a>, the <a href="feeding_the_multitude" title="wikilink">feeding of the 5,000</a>, <a href="Jesus&#39;_walk_on_water" title="wikilink">walking on water</a> and a number of other miracles and <a href="parables_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">parables</a>. It ends with the <a href="Confession_of_Peter" title="wikilink">Confession of Peter</a> and the Transfiguration.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the <a href="Perea_(Bible)" title="wikilink">Perean</a> ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the <a href="Sea_of_Galilee" title="wikilink">Sea of Galilee</a> along the Jordan (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#10:40" title="wikilink">John 10:40&lt;U+2013&gt;42</a>). The <a href="Ministry_of_Jesus#Final_ministry_in_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">final ministry in Jerusalem</a> begins with the Jesus' <a href="triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">triumphal entry</a> into the city on <a href="Palm_Sunday" title="wikilink">Palm Sunday</a>. In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus drives the money changers from the Temple and <a href="Bargain_of_Judas" title="wikilink">Judas bargains to betray</a> him. This period culminates in the Last Supper and the Farewell Discourse.</p>

<p>Commentaries often discuss the teachings of Jesus in terms of his &quot;words and works&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The words include a number of sermons, as well as parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the Gospel of John includes no narrative parables). The works include the miracles and other acts performed during Jesus' ministry.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Although the canonical gospels are the major source of the teachings of Jesus, the Pauline epistles provide some of the earliest written accounts.</p>
<p>John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#3:34" title="wikilink">John 3:34</a>: &quot;He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.&quot; In <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#7:16" title="wikilink">John 7:16</a> Jesus says, &quot;My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.&quot; He asserts the same thing in <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#14:10" title="wikilink">John 14:10</a>: &quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?

<p>The Kingdom of God (also called the Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew) is one of the key elements of Jesus' teachings in the New Testament. Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message. He calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to God.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Jesus tells his followers to adhere strictly to <a href="Jewish_law" title="wikilink">Jewish law</a>, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the <a href="Sabbath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabbath</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind ... And a second is like it: &lt;U+2018&gt;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#22:37" title="wikilink">Matthew 22:37&lt;U+2013&gt;39</a>). Other ethical teachings of Jesus include <a href="Matthew_5:44" title="wikilink">loving one's enemies</a>, refraining from hatred and lust, and <a href="turning_the_other_cheek" title="wikilink">turning the other cheek</a> (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#5:21" title="wikilink">Matthew 5:21&lt;U+2013&gt;44</a>).<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>In the gospels, the approximately thirty parables form about one third of Jesus' recorded teachings.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the <a href="Spirituality" title="wikilink">spiritual</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Some of his parables, such as the <a href="Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son" title="wikilink">Prodigal Son</a> (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#15:11" title="wikilink">Luke 15:11&lt;U+2013&gt;32</a>), are relatively simple, while others, such as the <a href="Parable_of_the_Growing_Seed" title="wikilink">Growing Seed</a> (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#4:26" title="wikilink">Mark 4:26&lt;U+2013&gt;29</a>), are more abstruse.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles, especially healings. The four accounts together record about 35 or 36 miracles.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include <a href="turning_water_into_wine" title="wikilink">turning water into wine</a>, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus' opponents accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of <a href="Beelzebul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beelzebul</a>, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#12:28" title="wikilink">Matthew 12:28</a>) or &quot;finger of God&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#11:20" title="wikilink">Luke 11:20</a>).<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>In John, Jesus' miracles are described as &quot;signs&quot;, performed to prove his mission and divinity.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> However, in the Synoptics, when asked to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus' miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick. In John's Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith.

</figure>
<p>In the four canonical gospels, Jesus' final entry into Jerusalem takes place at the beginning of the last week of his life, a few days before the Last Supper, marking the beginning of the Passion narrative. The day of entry into Jerusalem is identified by Mark and John as Sunday and by Matthew as Monday; Luke does not identify the day. After leaving <a href="Bethany_(Biblical_village)" title="wikilink">Bethany</a> Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem. People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him and sing part of <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Psalms#118:25" title="wikilink">Psalm 118:25&lt;U+2013&gt;26</a>. The cheering crowds greeting Jesus as he enters Jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment.</p>
<p>In the three Synoptic Gospels, entry into Jerusalem is followed by the Cleansing of the Temple, in which Jesus expels the money changers from the temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. This is the only account of Jesus using physical force in any of the gospels.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#2:13" title="wikilink">John 2:13&lt;U+2013&gt;16</a> includes a similar narrative much earlier, and scholars debate whether the passage refers to the same episode.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The Synoptics include a number of well-known parables and sermons, such as the <a href="Widow&#39;s_mite" title="wikilink">Widow's mite</a> and the <a href="Second_Coming_Prophecy" title="wikilink">Second Coming Prophecy</a>, during the week that follows.</p>

<p>The Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his <a href="Twelve_Apostles#The_Twelve_Apostles" title="wikilink">twelve apostles</a> in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels, and Paul's <a href="First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians" title="wikilink">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/1_Corinthians#11:23" title="wikilink">11:23&lt;U+2013&gt;26</a>) also refers to it.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> During the meal, <a href="Jesus_predicts_his_betrayal" title="wikilink">Jesus predicts</a> that one of his apostles will betray him.

<p>In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to the disciples, saying, &quot;This is my body, which is given for you&quot;. He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, &quot;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot; (<a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#22:19" title="wikilink">Luke 22:19&lt;U+2013&gt;20</a>).<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The Christian <a href="sacrament" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacrament</a> or <a href="Ordinance_(Christian)" title="wikilink">ordinance</a> of the <a href="Eucharist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eucharist</a> is based on these events.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#6:58" title="wikilink">John 6:58&lt;U+2013&gt;59</a> (the <a href="Bread_of_Life_Discourse" title="wikilink">Bread of Life Discourse</a>) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the <a href="Origin_of_the_Eucharist#Institution_narratives" title="wikilink">institution narratives</a> in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.</p>

Judas appears in the garden, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons.

<p>Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary <a href="Christ_Carrying_the_Cross" title="wikilink">carrying his cross</a>; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the <a href="Via_Dolorosa" title="wikilink">Via Dolorosa</a>. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that <a href="Simon_of_Cyrene" title="wikilink">Simon of Cyrene</a> assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so. In <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#23:27" title="wikilink">Luke 23:27&lt;U+2013&gt;28</a> Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children. At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.</p>
<p>The soldiers then crucify Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews&quot;; soldiers and passers-by mock him about it. Jesus is crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead. In <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John_19:34" title="wikilink">John 19:34</a>, one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and water flows out. In <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#27:51" title="wikilink">Matthew 27:51&lt;U+2013&gt;54</a>, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn and an earthquake breaks open tombs. Terrified by the events, a Roman <a href="centurion" class="uri" title="wikilink">centurion</a> states that Jesus was the Son of God.</p>
<p>On the same day, <a href="Joseph_of_Arimathea" title="wikilink">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, with Pilate's permission and with <a href="Nicodemus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicodemus</a>' help, <a href="Descent_from_the_Cross" title="wikilink">removes Jesus' body from the cross</a>, wraps him in a clean cloth and buries him in a new <a href="Sepulchre" title="wikilink">rock-hewn tomb</a>. In <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#27:62" title="wikilink">Matthew 27:62&lt;U+2013&gt;66</a>, on the following day the Jews ask Pilate for the tomb to be sealed with a stone and placed under guard to ensure the body will remain there.</p>
<h3 id="resurrection-and-ascension">Resurrection and ascension</h3>


<p>New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection state that on the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), his tomb is discovered to be empty and his followers encounter him risen from the dead. His followers arrive at the tomb early in the morning and meet either one or two beings (men or angels) dressed in bright robes. <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#16:9" title="wikilink">Mark 16:9</a> and <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/John#20:15" title="wikilink">John 20:15</a> indicate that Jesus appears to <a href="Mary_Magdalene" title="wikilink">Mary Magdalene</a> first, and <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#16:9" title="wikilink">Luke 16:9</a> states that she is one of the <a href="myrrhbearers" class="uri" title="wikilink">myrrhbearers</a>.</p>

These include the <a href="Doubting_Thomas" title="wikilink">Doubting Thomas</a> episode and the <a href="Road_to_Emmaus_appearance" title="wikilink">appearance on the road to Emmaus</a>, where Jesus meets two disciples. The <a href="catch_of_153_fish" title="wikilink">catch of 153 fish</a> is a miracle by the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.</p>
<p>Before he ascends into heaven, Jesus <a href="Great_Commission" title="wikilink">commissions his disciples</a> to spread his teachings to all the nations of the world. <a href="s:Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#24:51" title="wikilink">Luke 24:51</a> states that Jesus is then &quot;carried up into heaven&quot;.

<h2 id="historical-views">Historical views</h2>


<p>Prior to the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a>, the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. Scholars have studied and debated a number of issues concerning the historical Jesus, such as his existence, the origins and historical reliability of the gospels and other sources, and the precise portrait of the historical figure.</p>

<p>The <a href="Christ_myth_theory" title="wikilink">Christ myth theory</a>, which questions the existence of Jesus, appeared in the 18th century. Some of its supporters contend that Jesus is a myth invented by early Christians.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Supporters of the theory point to the lack of any known written references to Jesus during his lifetime and to the relative scarcity of non-Christian references to him in the 1st century, which they use to challenge the veracity of the existing accounts of him. Beginning in the 20th century, scholars such as <a href="G._A._Wells" title="wikilink">G. A. Wells</a>, <a href="Robert_M._Price" title="wikilink">Robert M. Price</a> and Thomas Brodie have presented various arguments to support the Christ myth theory.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> However, today virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that <a href="Historicity_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesus existed</a> and regard events such as his baptism and his crucifixion as historical.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> <a href="Robert_E._Van_Voorst" title="wikilink">Robert E.

<p>In response to the argument that the lack of the contemporary references implies that Jesus did not exist, Van Voorst has stated that, &quot;as every good student of history knows&quot;, such <a href="arguments_from_silence" title="wikilink">arguments from silence</a> are &quot;specially perilous&quot;. Arguments from silence generally fail unless a fact is known to the author and is important enough and relevant enough to be mentioned in the context of a document.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> <a href="Bart_D._Ehrman" title="wikilink">Bart D.

It would therefore be unsound to expect contemporary accounts of his deeds.</p>
<p>Ehrman says that arguments based on the lack of physical or archeological evidence of Jesus and of any writings from him are poor, as there is no such evidence of &quot;nearly <em>anyone</em> who lived in the first century&quot;.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Teresa Okure writes that the existence of historical figures is established by the analysis of later references to them, rather than by contemporary relics and remnants.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> A number of scholars caution against the use of such <a href="arguments_from_ignorance" title="wikilink">arguments from ignorance</a> and consider them generally inconclusive or fallacious.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> <a href="Doug_Walton" title="wikilink">Douglas Walton</a> states that arguments from ignorance can only lead to sound conclusions in cases where we can assume that our &quot;knowledge-base is complete&quot;.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Non-Christian sources used to establish the historical existence of Jesus include the works of first-century historians Josephus and <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a>. Josephus scholar <a href="Louis_H._Feldman" title="wikilink">Louis H. Feldman</a> has stated that &quot;few have doubted the genuineness&quot; of Josephus' reference to Jesus in <a href="s:The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XX#Chapter_9" title="wikilink">book 20</a> of the <em><a href="Antiquities_of_the_Jews" title="wikilink">Antiquities of the Jews</a></em>, and it is disputed only by a small number of scholars.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Tacitus referred to Christ and his execution by Pilate in <a href="wikisource:The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_15#44" title="wikilink">book 15</a> of his work <em><a href="Annals_(Tacitus)" title="wikilink">Annals</a></em>.

<h3 id="historicity-of-events">Historicity of events</h3>


<p>Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the &quot;maximalist&quot; approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the &quot;minimalist&quot; approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> In the 1950s, as the second <a href="quest_for_the_historical_Jesus" title="wikilink">quest for the historical Jesus</a> gathered pace, the minimalist approaches faded away, and in the 21st century, minimalists such as Price are a very small minority. Although a belief in the inerrancy of the gospels cannot be supported historically, many scholars since the 1980s have held that, beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain, certain other elements of Jesus' life are &quot;historically probable&quot;.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable elements.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>Most modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism and crucifixion to be definite historical facts. <a href="James_Dunn_(theologian)" title="wikilink">James D. G. Dunn</a> states that they &quot;command almost universal assent&quot; and &quot;rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts&quot; that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. Scholars adduce the <a href="criterion_of_embarrassment" title="wikilink">criterion of embarrassment</a>, saying that early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader, or a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed sins and wanted to repent.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Scholars use a number of criteria, such as the <a href="criterion_of_multiple_attestation" title="wikilink">criterion of multiple attestation</a>, the <a href="Biblical_criticism#Coherence" title="wikilink">criterion of coherence</a>, and the <a href="criterion_of_discontinuity" title="wikilink">criterion of discontinuity</a> to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source. Mark, the earliest written gospel, is usually considered the most historically reliable.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable. For example, many scholars do not consider the Raising of Lazarus to be historical, partly because it appears only in John.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> <a href="Amy-Jill_Levine" title="wikilink">Amy-Jill Levine</a> states that there is &quot;a consensus of sorts&quot; on the basic outline of Jesus' life, in that most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, debated with Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables, gathered followers, and was crucified on Pilate's orders.</p>
<h3 id="portraits-of-jesus">Portraits of Jesus</h3>

<p>Modern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. <a href="Ben_Witherington_III" title="wikilink">Ben Witherington</a> states that &quot;there are now as many portraits of the historical Jesus as there are scholarly painters&quot;. <a href="Bart_Ehrman" title="wikilink">Bart Ehrman</a> and separately <a href="Andreas_K&lt;U+00F6&gt;stenberger" title="wikilink">Andreas K&lt;U+00F6&gt;stenberger</a> contend that given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>The mainstream profiles in the third quest may be grouped according to whether they portray Jesus primarily as an <a href="apocalyptic" title="wikilink">apocalyptic prophet</a>, a charismatic healer, a <a href="Cynicism_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">cynic philosopher</a>, the true Messiah, or an egalitarian prophet of social change.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Each of these types has a number of variants, and some scholars reject the basic elements of some portraits. However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
