<p><strong>Sibyl de Neufmarch&lt;U+00E9&gt;</strong>, Countess of Hereford, <em><a href="suo_jure" title="wikilink">suo jure</a></em> Lady of Brecknock (<a href="circa" title="wikilink">c.</a> 1100 – after 1143), was a <a href="Cambro-Norman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambro-Norman</a> <a href="Nobility" title="wikilink">noblewoman</a>, heiress to one of the most substantial <a href="fief" title="wikilink">fiefs</a> in the <a href="Welsh_Marches" title="wikilink">Welsh Marches</a>. The great-granddaughter of <a href="Gruffydd_ap_Llywelyn" title="wikilink">Gruffydd ap Llywelyn</a>, king of Wales, Sibyl was also connected to the nobility of England and Normandy. Sibyl inherited the titles and lands of her father, <a href="Bernard_de_Neufmarch&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Bernard de Neufmarch&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, Lord of <a href="Brecon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brecon</a>, after her mother, Nest ferch Osbern, had declared her brother Mahel to have been illegitimate. Most of these estates passed to Sibyl's husband, <a href="Miles_de_Gloucester,_1st_Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford</a>, as her <a href="dowry" class="uri" title="wikilink">dowry</a>. Their marriage had been arranged personally by <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry I of England</a> in the spring of 1121. Sibyl, with her extensive lands, was central to the King's plans of consolidating <a href="Anglo-Norman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Norman</a> power in south-east Wales by the merging of her estates with those of Miles, his loyal subject on whom he relied to implement <a href="The_Crown" title="wikilink">Crown</a> policy.</p>
<p>As an adult, Sibyl lived through <a href="Stephen_of_England" title="wikilink">King Stephen's</a> turbulent reign, known to history as <a href="the_Anarchy" title="wikilink">the Anarchy</a>, in which her husband played a pivotal role. Following Miles' accidental death in 1143, Sibyl entered a religious life at <a href="Llanthony_Secunda" title="wikilink">Llanthony Secunda Priory</a>, Gloucestershire, England, which she had endowed up to six years previously. Sibyl is buried at the priory, founded by Miles in 1136.</p>

<h3 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
<p>Sibyl had two brothers, Philip, who most likely died young, and Mahel. Nest had Mahel disinherited by swearing to King Henry I of England that Mahel had been fathered by another man. According to <a href="Giraldus_Cambrensis" title="wikilink">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, this was done out of vengeance when Mahel had multilated Nest's lover, a knight whose identity is not disclosed.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the 19th century, <a href="Bernard_Bolingbroke_Woodward" title="wikilink">Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward</a> proposed that, after Bernard's death, Nest &quot;disgraced herself with an intrigue&quot; with one of his soldiers. Mahel, who had by this time inherited Bernard's estates, disapproved of the liaison to such an extent that he killed Nest's lover. Nest's revenge was to have Mahel disinherited by claiming that Bernard was not Mahel's father.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <em>maritagium</em> (marriage charter) arranged by King Henry in 1121 for the marriage between Sibyl and her future husband Miles, however, makes it clear that Bernard was still alive when it was written; showing Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward's version of the story to diverge from the known facts.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Author Jennifer C.

who granted Sibyl in marriage to Miles de Gloucester</p>
</center>
<p>]]</p>
<p>Sometime in April or May 1121, Sibyl married Miles (or Milo) FitzWalter de Gloucester, Sheriff of <a href="Gloucester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucester</a> and <a href="Lord_High_Constable_of_England" title="wikilink">Constable of England</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The marriage was personally arranged by King Henry I, to whom Miles was a trusted royal official.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A charter written in Latin (the <em>maritagium</em>), which dates to 10 April/29 May 1121, records the arrangements for the marriage of Sibyl and Miles.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Historian <a href="C._Warren_Hollister" title="wikilink">C.

<p>By arranging a series of matrimonial alliances, similar to that between Sibyl and Miles, King Henry I of England transformed &quot;the map of territorial power in south-east Wales&quot;. Such arrangements were mutually advantageous. Hollister describes Miles' marriage to Sibyl as having been a &quot;crucial breakthrough in his career&quot;. The new lords, in similar positions to Miles, were the King's own loyal <a href="vassal" title="wikilink">vassals</a>, on whom he could rely to implement royal policy.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Sibyl's father died sometime before 1128 (most probably in 1125), and Miles came into possession of her entire inheritance, which when merged with his own estates, formed one <a href="Honour_(land)" title="wikilink">honour</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>]] After Henry I's death in 1135, the throne of England was seized by <a href="Stephen,_King_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen of Blois</a>, a grandson of William I of England. Henry's daughter, <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a> (Maud), also claimed the throne, and had the support of the Marcher Lords. On the death of her husband, the <a href="Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V</a>, in 1125, Matilda had returned to England for the first time in 16 years. At the insistence of her father, the <a href="Baron#Barons_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_the_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">barons</a> (including Stephen) swore to uphold Matilda's rights as his heir. Matilda married <a href="Geoffrey_Plantagenet,_Count_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Geoffrey of Anjou</a> in 1128. They lived together in France, having three sons; the eldest of whom was to become King <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II of England</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Initially, Miles supported Stephen. In about 1136, Stephen granted Sibyl's husband the entire honour of Gloucester and Brecknock; afterward appointing him <a href="Constable_of_England" title="wikilink">Constable of England</a>, whereby Miles became known as one of Stephen's &quot;henchmen&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>]] Miles transferred his allegiance to Empress Matilda, on her return to England in 1139.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, and the necessity of joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful <a href="Robert,_1st_Earl_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester</a>, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian <a href="Ralph_Henry_Carless_Davis" title="wikilink">R.H.C. Davis</a>, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> He also received <a href="St._Briavels" title="wikilink">St. Briavels</a> Castle and the <a href="Forest_of_Dean" title="wikilink">Forest of Dean</a>. At the time Matilda was the <em><a href="de_facto" title="wikilink">de facto</a></em> ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> following his capture the previous February after the <a href="Battle_of_Lincoln_(1141)" title="wikilink">Battle of Lincoln</a>. Sibyl was styled <strong>Countess of Hereford</strong>, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from <a href="Brien_FitzCount" title="wikilink">Brien FitzCount</a>, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke <a href="Alan_IV_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Alan IV of Brittany</a>. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of <a href="Wallingford_Castle" title="wikilink">Wallingford</a> during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>During <a href="the_Anarchy" title="wikilink">the Anarchy</a>, which the period of Stephen's reign as King of England was to become known, life was greatly disrupted in her husband's lands. Sibyl would have doubtless suffered as a result, especially after Miles' decision to support Matilda's claim to the throne and to oppose Stephen.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> When Matilda was defeated at <a href="Winchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winchester</a> in late 1141, Miles was compelled to return to <a href="Gloucester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucester</a> in disgrace: &quot;weary, half-naked and alone&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In November of that same year, Stephen was released from prison and restored to the English throne.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Sibyl's distress would have been heightened in 1143 after the <a href="Bishop_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Bishop of Hereford</a>, <a href="Robert_de_Bethune" title="wikilink">Robert de Bethune</a> placed an <a href="interdict" class="uri" title="wikilink">interdict</a> upon <a href="Herefordshire" title="wikilink">Hereford</a>, blocked all the <a href="Hereford_Cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedral's</a> entrances with thorns, and <a href="Excommunication" title="wikilink">excommunicated</a> Miles. In order to raise money to pay his troops and to assist Matilda financially, Miles had imposed a <a href="levy" class="uri" title="wikilink">levy</a> on all the churches in his earldom, an act which the bishop had regarded as unlawful.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> When the bishop protested and threatened Miles with excommunication, Miles in response, sent his men to plunder the diocese of its resources.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In retaliation against Miles' earlier attacks on the royalist city of <a href="Worcester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcester</a> and the castles of Hereford and Wallingford, King Stephen bestowed the title &quot;Earl of Hereford&quot; on <a href="Robert_de_Beaumont,_2nd_Earl_of_Leicester" title="wikilink">Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester</a>; Miles, however, never surrendered the earldom nor the title to Robert de Beaumont.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>The Brecknock lordship would eventually go to the de Bohuns, by way of <a href="Eleanor_de_Braose" title="wikilink">Eleanor de Braose</a>. Eleanor, a descendant of Sibyl's through Bertha of Hereford, married Humphrey de Bohun, son of the <a href="Humphrey_de_Bohun,_2nd_Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">2nd Earl of Hereford</a>. Eleanor and Humphrey's son, <a href="Humphrey_de_Bohun,_3rd_Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Humphrey de Bohun</a>, succeeded his grandfather to the titles in 1275.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Through the advantageous marriages of her daughters, Sibyl was an ancestress of many of England and Ireland's noblest families including among others, the de Bohun's, de Beauchamps, Mortimers, Fitzalans, de Burghs, de Lacy's, and Bonvilles. Four of her descendants, <a href="Humphrey_de_Bohun,_4th_Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford</a>, <a href="Elizabeth_de_Burgh,_4th_Countess_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster</a>, <a href="Eleanor_de_Bohun" title="wikilink">Eleanor de Bohun</a>, and <a href="Mary_de_Bohun" title="wikilink">Mary de Bohun</a> married into the <a href="English_royal_family" title="wikilink">English royal family</a>, while another, <a href="Anne_Mortimer" title="wikilink">Anne Mortimer</a> was the grandmother of <a href="House_of_York" title="wikilink">Yorkist</a> kings <a href="Edward_IV_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward IV</a> and <a href="Richard_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard III</a>. By way of Edward's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth_of_York" title="wikilink">Elizabeth of York</a>, every monarch of England and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, from <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> up to and including <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a>, descended in a direct line from Sibyl de Neufmarch&lt;U+00E9&gt;, as did the various royal sovereigns of Europe who shared a common descent from <a href="Mary,_Queen_of_Scots" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
