<p><strong>Bahram-e Pazhdo</strong>, meaning Bahram (son) of Pazhdo, was a <a href="Zoroastrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> and <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> poet of the 13th century.</p>
<p>Bahram-e Pazhdo's only surviving work is his <em>Bahariyyat</em> &quot;Spring&quot;, a 330-couplet composition, in <a href="hazaj_meter" title="wikilink">hazaj meter</a>, that dates to 1257. The poem celebrates the spring season, the Iranian new year festival <a href="Nowruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nowruz</a>, the prophet <a href="Zoroaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroaster</a>, the praise of Kings and leaders who upheld or propagated the <a href="Zoroastrianism" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> religion, the <a href="ashavan" title="wikilink">righteous deceased</a> of that faith, as well as those who might copy his poem. According to Professor Jaleh Amuzegar, the <em>Bahariyyat</em> &quot;has little literary merit and is poorly composed.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The oldest surviving copy of the <em>Bahariyyat</em> is in a greater collection that dates to 1653-1655. That edition of the <em>Bahariyyat</em>, dated 1654, covers folios 219-223 of the 512-folio codex. As of 1989,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the compendium was in the custody of the Public Library in <a href="St._Petersburg" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg</a>, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>.</p>
<p>Bahram-e Pazhdo was the father of <a href="Zartosht_Bahram_e_Pazhdo" title="wikilink">Zartosht Bahram</a>, composer of the better-known <em>Zartosht-nama</em>. In the son's verse adaptation of the <em><a href="Book_of_Arda_Viraf" title="wikilink">Book of Arda Viraf</a></em> and which immediately precedes the father's poem in the above-mentioned 512-folio codex, Bahram-e Pazhdo is described as a writer (<em>dabir</em>), as a man of letters (<em>adib</em>), as a priest (<em><a href="herbad" class="uri" title="wikilink">herbad</a></em>) and astronomer, and as someone who wrote good poetry in <a href="Middle_Persian" title="wikilink">Middle Persian</a> and in <a href="New_Persian" title="wikilink">New Persian</a>.</p>
