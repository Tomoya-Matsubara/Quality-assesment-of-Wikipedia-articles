<p>The <strong>Hindu-German Conspiracy</strong><sup><a href="#Note_on_the_name" title="wikilink">(name)</a></sup> refers to a series of plans formulated between 1914 and 1917 to initiate a Pan-Indian rebellion against the <a href="British_Raj" title="wikilink">British Raj</a> during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. The conspirators included <a href="Indian_independence_movement" title="wikilink">Indian Nationalists</a> in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, with the help of the <a href="Irish_republicanism" title="wikilink">Irish Republicans</a> and the <a href="Ausw&lt;U+00E4&gt;rtiges_Amt" title="wikilink">German Foreign Office</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The conspiracy was formulated at the beginning of the War, between the <a href="Ghadar_Party" title="wikilink">Ghadar Party</a> in the United States, the <a href="Berlin_Committee" title="wikilink">Berlin Committee</a> in Germany, the <a href="Indian_revolutionary_underground" title="wikilink">Indian revolutionary underground</a> in <a href="British_India" title="wikilink">India</a>, <a href="Sinn_F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in" title="wikilink">Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in</a>, and the German Foreign Office through the consulate in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>. The most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a Pan-Indian mutiny in the <a href="British_Indian_Army" title="wikilink">British Indian Army</a> from <a href="Punjab_(British_India)" title="wikilink">Punjab</a> to <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>. This plot was planned to be executed in <a href="February" class="uri" title="wikilink">February</a> <a href="1915" class="uri" title="wikilink">1915</a> with the aim of overthrowing the Raj from the <a href="Indian_subcontinent" title="wikilink">Indian subcontinent</a>. The <a href="Ghadar_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">February mutiny</a> was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement, arresting key figures.

The Indo-Irish-German alliance and the conspiracy were the target of a worldwide British intelligence effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The conspiracy resulted in the <a href="Lahore_conspiracy_case" title="wikilink">Lahore conspiracy case</a> trials in India as well as the <a href="Hindu_German_Conspiracy_Trial" title="wikilink">Hindu German Conspiracy Trial</a>â€”at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This series of events was consequential to the Indian independence movement. Though it largely subdued by the end of World War I, the rebellion posed a significant threat to British India and became a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Similar efforts were made during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> in Germany, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, and in <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a> which saw the formations of <a href="Indische_legion" title="wikilink">Indische legion</a>, <a href="Battaglione_Azad_Hindoustan" title="wikilink">Battaglione Azad Hindoustan</a> and <a href="Indian_National_Army" title="wikilink">Indian National Army</a> respectively.</p>

This organisation, with the support of Indian nationalists such as <a href="Dadabhai_Naoroji" title="wikilink">Dadabhai Naoroji</a>, <a href="Lala_Lajpat_Rai" title="wikilink">Lala Lajpat Rai</a>, and <a href="Madame_Bhikaji_Cama" title="wikilink">Madame Bhikaji Cama</a>, offered scholarships to Indian students, promoted nationalistic work, and was a major platform for anti-colonial opinions and views. <em><a href="The_Indian_Sociologist" title="wikilink">The Indian Sociologist</a></em> published by Krishna Varma was a notable anti-colonial publication. A number of other prominent Indian nationalists were also associated with the India House, including <a href="Madan_Lal_Dhingra" title="wikilink">Madan Lal Dhingra</a>, <a href="Vinayak_Damodar_Savarkar" title="wikilink">Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</a>, <a href="Virendranath_Chattopadhyaya" title="wikilink">Virendranath Chattopadhyaya</a>, and <a href="Har_Dayal" title="wikilink">Har Dayal</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The India House soon came under British scrutiny for the nature of its work and the increasingly inflammatory tone of <em>The Indian Sociologist</em>. In <a href="1909" class="uri" title="wikilink">1909</a>, <a href="Madan_Lal_Dhingra" title="wikilink">Madan Lal Dhingra</a> fatally shot <a href="William_Hutt_Curzon_Wyllie" title="wikilink">William Hutt Curzon Wyllie</a>, the political <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_India" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for India</a>. In the aftermath of the assassination, the India House was rapidly suppressed. While some of its leaders, like Krishna Varma, fled to <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, others like Chattopadhyaya, moved to Germany and many others moved to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The economic scenario in India in the early 1900s was depressing and this led to large scale immigration of <a href="Punjabi" title="wikilink">Punjabis</a> to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. The <a href="Canadian_government" title="wikilink">Canadian government</a> decided to curtail this influx with a series of legislations, which were aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into the country and restricting the political rights of those already in the country. Though the Punjabi community had been an important loyal force for the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a>, legislations like these led to discontent and protests within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. A large number of Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ghadar-party">Ghadar Party</h3>


<p><img src="Ghadar_di_gunj.jpg" title="fig:Ghadar di Gunj, an early Ghadarite compilation of nationalist and socialist literature, was banned in India in 1913." alt="Ghadar di Gunj, an early Ghadarite compilation of nationalist and socialist literature, was banned in India in 1913." width="150" /> The Ghadar Party, initially the <em>Pacific Coast Hindustan Association</em>, was formed in 1913 in the United States under the leadership of <a href="Har_Dayal" title="wikilink">Har Dayal</a>, with <a href="Sohan_Singh_Bhakna" title="wikilink">Sohan Singh Bhakna</a> as its president. The members of the party were <a href="Indian_immigrant" title="wikilink">Indian immigrants</a>, largely from <a href="Punjab_(British_India)" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Many of its members were from the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California at Berkeley</a> including Dayal, <a href="Tarak_Nath_Das" title="wikilink">Tarak Nath Das</a>, <a href="Maulavi_Barkatullah" title="wikilink">Maulavi Barkatullah</a>, <a href="Kartar_Singh_Sarabha" title="wikilink">Kartar Singh Sarabha</a> and <a href="Vishnu_Ganesh_Pingle" title="wikilink">V.G. Pingle</a>. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> and Asia.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Ghadar was to overthrow <a href="British_India" title="wikilink">British colonial authority in India</a> by means of an armed revolution. Although the <a href="Indian_National_Congress" title="wikilink">Indian National Congress</a> led a <a href="Indian_independence_movement" title="wikilink">mainstream movement</a> for <a href="dominion_status" title="wikilink">dominion status</a>, its constitutional methods and modest aims were viewed by Ghadar as soft. Ghadar's foremost strategy was to entice <a href="British_Indian_Army" title="wikilink">Indian soldiers</a> to revolt.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the <em>Yugantar Ashram</em> press in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>. The press produced the <em><a href="Hindustan_Ghadar" title="wikilink">Hindustan Ghadar</a></em> newspaper and other nationalist literature. Ghadar meetings were held in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, <a href="Washington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, and Shanghai.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Towards the end of 1913, the party established contact with prominent revolutionaries in India, including <a href="Rash_Behari_Bose" title="wikilink">Rash Behari Bose</a>. An Indian edition of the <em>Hindustan Ghadar</em> essentially espoused the philosophies of <a href="anarchism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchism</a> and <a href="revolutionary_terrorism" title="wikilink">revolutionary terrorism</a> against British interests in India. Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab, and Ghadarite publications that reached <a href="Bombay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bombay</a> from California were deemed seditious and banned by the Raj. These events, compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the <a href="Delhi-Lahore_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy</a> of 1912, led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature, which emanated mostly from San Francisco.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

More groups were scattered around <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>. The <a href="Partition_of_Bengal" title="wikilink">Partition of Bengal</a> in 1905 resulted in a major movement being organised in Bengal by the educated youth of the urban <a href="middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a> <em><a href="Bhadralok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bhadralok</a></em> community that epitomised the &quot;classic&quot; Indian revolutionary.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Another important movement organised in Punjab had immense support base in the rural and military society of the Punjab.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Revolutionary organisations like <a href="Jugantar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jugantar</a> and <a href="Anushilan_Samiti" title="wikilink">Anushilan Samiti</a> emerged in the 1900s. A number of events of political terrorism were witnessed, prominent among which was the <a href="Delhi-Lahore_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy</a>, led by erstwhile Jugantar member <a href="Rash_Behari_Bose" title="wikilink">Rash Behari Bose</a>, to assassinate the then <a href="Viceroy_of_India" title="wikilink">Viceroy of India</a>, <a href="Charles_Hardinge" title="wikilink">Charles Hardinge</a>. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time the World War I had begun in Europe, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal, the movement which was revived mainly in the French base of <a href="Chandernagore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chandernagore</a>, was strong enough to nearly paralyse the local administration in Bengal.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India is found in <em>Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation</em> which reported that <a href="Jatin_Mukherjee" title="wikilink">Jatin Mukherjee</a> (Bagha Jatin) and <a href="Naren_Bhattacharya" title="wikilink">Naren Bhattacharya</a> had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to <a href="Calcutta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a> in 1912, and obtained an assurance that arms and ammunition would be supplied to them.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During the same time, an increasingly strong Pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India.

<h3 id="irish-involvement">Irish involvement</h3>


<p>Irish collaboration with the Ghadarite plans and efforts pre-dated World War I by at least six years. The conspiracy, during its planning stages, garnered major support from a network formed by the Ghadarites, the Irish and the Irish-American reporters and newspapers.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Har Dayal had close links in the Bay Area of San Francisco with Irish people like John Barry at the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Bulletin" title="wikilink">San Francisco Bulletin</a></em> and other people at the <em><a href="The_Gaelic_American_Newspaper" title="wikilink">Gaelic American</a></em> weekly.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="Barkatullah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barkatullah</a>, later the Ghadar Vice-President, became acquainted with <a href="George_Freeman" title="wikilink">George Freeman</a> who was the editor of the <em>Gaelic American</em>.

<p>With the onset of World War I, erstwhile members of the India House like Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Abhinash Bhattacharya, Dr. Abdul Hafiz, Padmanabhan Pillai and Gopal Paranjape, joined hands with some Indian students in Germany to form to form a revolutionary group called the <a href="Berlin_Committee" title="wikilink">Berlin Committee</a> (later called the Indian Independence Committee).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This had the active support of <a href="Arthur_Zimmermann" title="wikilink">Arthur Zimmermann</a>, the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the German Empire.

Tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California, the German consulate in San Francisco established links with Ram Chandra, a Ghadarite leader, through a naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von Brincken, Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles Lattendorf.

<p>During the World War I, the <a href="British_Indian_Army" title="wikilink">British Indian Army</a> contributed significantly to the British war effort. Consequently, a reduced force, estimated to have been as low as 15,000 troops in late 1914, was stationed in India.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> It was in this scenario that concrete plans for organising uprisings in India were made.</p>
<p>In September 1913, Mathra Singh, a Ghadarite, visited Shanghai and promoted the Ghadarite cause within the Indian community there. In January 1914, Singh visited India and circulated Ghadar literature amongst Indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for Hong Kong. Singh's reported that the situation in India was favourable for a revolution.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1914, the Canadian government refused to allow the 400 Indian passengers of the ship <em><a href="Komagata_Maru" title="wikilink">Komagata Maru</a></em> to disembark at <a href="Vancouver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a>. The voyage had been planned as an attempt to circumvent Canadian exclusion laws that effectively prevented Indian immigration. Before the ship reached Vancouver, its approach was announced on German radio, and <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbian</a> authorities were prepared to prevent the passengers from entering Canada. The incident became a focal point for the Indian community in Canada which rallied in support of the passengers and against the government's policies. After a 2 month legal battle, 24 of the them were allowed to immigrate. The ship was escorted out of Vancouver by the battleship  and returned to India. On reaching <a href="Calcutta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a>, the passengers were detained under the <a href="Defence_of_India_Act" title="wikilink">Defence of India Act</a> at <a href="Budge_Budge" title="wikilink">Budge Budge</a> by the British Indian government, which made efforts to forcibly transport them to <a href="Punjab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>. This caused rioting at Budge Budge and resulted in fatalities on both sides.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> A number of Ghadar leaders, like Barkatullah and Taraknath Das, used the inflammatory passions surrounding the <em><a href="Komagata_Maru" title="wikilink">Komagata Maru</a></em> event as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party's fold.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>By October 1914, a large number of Ghadarites had returned to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> for <a href="Canton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canton</a> aboard the steamship <em>Korea</em> on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, where they would be provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were to be joined by more Indians arriving in smaller groups. During the September - October time period, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS <em>Siberia</em>, <em>Chinyo Maru</em>, <em>China</em>, <em>Manchuria</em>, SS <em>Tenyo Maru</em>, SS <em>Mongolia</em> and SS <em>Shinyo Maru</em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>The <em>Korea</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s party was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta.

<p>Efforts had begun as early as 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> When a clear idea of the conspiracy emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. After the failure of the SS <em>Korea</em> mission, Herambalal Gupta took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy and began efforts to obtain men and arms. While the former resource was in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The revolutionaries started negotiations with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held <a href="Sun_Yat_Sen" title="wikilink">Sun Yat Sen</a>'s power of attorney, to buy a million <a href="rifles" class="uri" title="wikilink">rifles</a>.

The ownership of ships were hidden under a massive smokescreen involving fake companies and oil business in south-east Asia. For the arms shipment itself, a successful cover was set up to lead British agents to believe that the arms were for the warring factions of the <a href="Mexican_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Mexican Civil War</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> This ruse was successful enough that the rival Villa faction offered $15,000 to divert the shipment to a Villa controlled port.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

The plot for the shipment itself failed when disastrous coordination prevented a successful rendezvous off <a href="Socorro_Island" title="wikilink">Socorro Island</a> with the <em>Maverick</em>. The plot had already been infiltrated by British intelligence through Indian and Irish agents linked closely with the conspiracy.

However, US customs stopped these attempts. In the meantime, with the help of the German Consul to Thailand Remy, the Ghadarite established a training headquarters in the jungles near the Thai-Burma border for Ghadarites arriving from China and Canada. German Consul General at Shanghai, Knipping, sent three officers of the <a href="Peking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peking</a> Embassy Guard for training and in addition arranged for a Norwegian agent in <a href="Swatow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swatow</a> to smuggle arms through.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> However, the Thai Police high command, which was largely British, discovered these plans and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the <a href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austrian</a> <a href="charge_d&lt;U+2019&gt;affaires" title="wikilink">charge d&lt;U+2019&gt;affaires</a>.

<p>The Berlin Committee, through <a href="Ottoman_Turkey" title="wikilink">Ottoman Turkey</a>, also established contact with <a href="Mahmud_al_Hasan" title="wikilink">Mahmud al Hasan</a> of <a href="Tehrek_e_Reshmi_Rumal" title="wikilink">Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal</a>.

Ubaidullah proceeded to <a href="Kabul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabul</a> to establish contact with the <a href="Habibullah_Khan" title="wikilink">Amir of Afghanistan</a> while Mahmud al Hasan proceeded to <a href="Hijaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hijaz</a> to establish contact with the Turkish Governor, Galib Pasha. At Kabul, <a href="Ubaid_Ullah" title="wikilink">Ubaid Ullah</a> decided that the pan-Islamic cause would be best served by focussing on the <a href="Indian_Freedom_Movement" title="wikilink">Indian Freedom Movement</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Ubaidullah proposed that the Afghan Amir declare war against Britain.

<p>Attempts made by the Deobandis of <a href="Tehrek_e_Reshmi_Rumal" title="wikilink">Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal</a>, to organise incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through <a href="Baluchistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baluchistan</a>, to Punjab. Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>â€”especially <a href="Basra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basra</a>, <a href="Bushehr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bushehr</a>, and <a href="Kut_al_Amara" title="wikilink">Kut al Amara</a>â€”were recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces in a number of fronts.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The Indians were led by <a href="Amba_Prasad_Sufi" title="wikilink">Amba Prasad Sufi</a>, who during the war was joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry. These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of <a href="Karman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karman</a> and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed <a href="Percy_Sykes" title="wikilink">Percy Sykes</a>' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The <a href="Aga_Khan" title="wikilink">Aga Khan</a>'s brother was killed while fighting the rebels.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The rebels successfully harassed British Forces in <a href="Sistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sistan</a> in Afghanistan, confining British forces to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi. Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar. The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites. It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a> was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged. They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of <a href="Shiraz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shiraz</a>. Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle. The Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Germans sent <a href="Niedermayer-Hentig_Mission" title="wikilink">a diplomatic mission</a> to attempt to rally the Afghan Amir to the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central</a> war effort. The mission was headed by <a href="Oskar_von_Niedermayer" title="wikilink">Oskar von Niedermayer</a> and included <a href="Werner_Otto_von_Hentig" title="wikilink">Werner Otto von Hentig</a>, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul, as well as <a href="Barkatullah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barkatullah</a> and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin Committee. Officially headed by <a href="Raja_Mahendra_Pratap" title="wikilink">Raja Mahendra Pratap</a>, the mission also had representatives the Ottoman Empire, including Kasim Bey (previously resident to <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>). The mission established contacts with the tribes of the Indo-Iranian border and encouraged them to strike against British interests.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>This mission was met by Ubaidullah Sindhi's group at Kabul in December 1915. Along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, it also brought messages from the Kaiser, <a href="Enver_Pasha" title="wikilink">Enver Pasha</a> and the displaced <a href="Khedive" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khedive</a> of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, Abbas Hilmi, expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The immediate aim was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain from the Afghan government a right of free passage.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the Amir refused to commit for or against the German proposals at the time, it found support amongst the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother <a href="Nasrullah_Khan" title="wikilink">Nasrullah Khan</a>, his sons <a href="Inayatullah_Khan" title="wikilink">Inayatullah Khan</a> and <a href="Amanullah_Khan" title="wikilink">Amanullah Khan</a>, as well as religious leaders and tribesmen.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> It also found support in one of Afghanistan's most influential newspapers, the <em>Siraj al-Akhbar</em>, whose editor <a href="Mahmud_Tarzi" title="wikilink">Mahmud Tarzi</a> took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916. Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti-British and pro-Central articles and propaganda. By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies to India.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of 1916, hopes of the Amir's support were nearly non-existent. Nonetheless, the <a href="Provisional_Government_of_India" title="wikilink">Provisional Government of India</a> was formed in Kabul December 1916 to emphasise to the Amir the seriousness of intent and purpose of the Germans and the Indians. The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as <a href="President" class="uri" title="wikilink">President</a>, Barkatullah as <a href="Prime_Minister" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a>, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister, and <a href="Champakaran_Pillai" title="wikilink">Champakaran Pillai</a> as Foreign Minister.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The provisional Government found support from Enver Pasha, proclaiming <em>Jihad</em> against Britain.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> It also attempted to obtain support from <a href="Tsar" title="wikilink">Tsarist</a> <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, <a href="Republican_China#Republican_China.2C_1911-1949" title="wikilink">Republican China</a>, and Japan and after the <a href="February_Revolution" title="wikilink">February Revolution</a> in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government. In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met <a href="Trotsky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trotsky</a> in <a href="Petrograd" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrograd</a> before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilise against British India.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Under pressure from the British, Afghan cooperation was withdrawn and the mission closed down. However, the <a href="Niedermayer-Hentig_Mission" title="wikilink">mission</a>, and its offers and liaisons at the time, had profound impact on the political and social situation in the country, starting a process of political change that ended with the <a href="assassination" class="uri" title="wikilink">assassination</a> of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and subsequently Amanullah, precipitating the <a href="Third_Anglo-Afghan_War" title="wikilink">Third Anglo-Afghan War</a> that led to Afghan Independence.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Mutiny_India_1920.JPG" title="fig:Mutiny India 1920. Jalandhar mutiny memorial at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin." alt="Mutiny India 1920. Jalandhar mutiny memorial at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin." width="150" /> By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the last events linked to the conspiracy derives from the Irish involvement when, on <a href="28_June" title="wikilink">28 June</a> <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>, units of the <a href="Connaught_Rangers" title="wikilink">Connaught Rangers</a> mutinied at <a href="Jullundur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jullundur</a> in Punjab. The <a href="Anglo-Irish_War" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish War</a> had already begun in Ireland with German support, to which the British government responded with large scale troop deployments. The most infamous of these were the <a href="Black_and_Tans" title="wikilink">Black and Tans</a> and the <a href="Auxiliary_Division" title="wikilink">Auxiliary Division</a>. The news of atrocities by these units, upon reaching India, was instrumental in triggering a mutiny in the 1st Battalion of the <a href="Connaught_Rangers" title="wikilink">Connaught Rangers</a>. Five men from C Company refused to take orders from their officers, declaring their intent not to serve the King until British forces left Ireland. The <a href="Union_Flag" title="wikilink">Union Flag</a> at Jullundur was replaced by the <a href="flag_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">flag</a> of the <a href="Irish_Republic" title="wikilink">Irish Republic</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> This mutiny was suppressed within three days and the mutineers imprisoned at <a href="Dagshai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dagshai</a>. However, rumours of execution of the prisoners led to the spread of unrests. At<a href="Solan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solan</a>, Private James Daly led about 70 Rangers in mutiny and tried to storm the <a href="armoury" class="uri" title="wikilink">armoury</a>, which the loyal guard successfully defended. Two mutineers were shot dead while others were taken prisoner. In all, about 400 men joined the mutiny, of whom eighty-eight were <a href="court_martial" title="wikilink">court martialled</a>. Fourteen were sentenced to death and the rest given up to 15 years in <a href="Wiktionary:gaol" title="wikilink">gaol</a>. A few were acquitted. Thirteen of the men sentenced to die had their sentences commuted to <a href="life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life imprisonment</a>. 21-year-old Daly was shot by a <a href="firing_squad" title="wikilink">firing squad</a> in Dagshai prison on <a href="November_2" title="wikilink">November 2</a>, <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>; he was the last member of British Forces to be executed for mutiny. Daly and John Miranda (who died in prison) were buried at the Dagshai graveyard.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="counter-intelligence">Counter intelligence</h2>

<p>Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Incidents like the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy and the <em><a href="Komagata_Maru" title="wikilink">Komagata Maru</a></em> incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-Indian militant unrest. Measures were taken which focussed on Bengalâ€”the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the timeâ€”and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of <em>Komagata Maru</em>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were &quot;cleaned up&quot; in the wake of the Delhi bomb case.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="in-asia">In Asia</h3>

<p>At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts. Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of <a href="19_February" title="wikilink">19 February</a>, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>The role of German or Baltic-German double-agents, especially the agent named <a href="Oren_(spy)" title="wikilink"><em>Oren</em></a>, was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year. Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured. Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="in-europe-and-the-middle-east">In Europe and the Middle East</h3>

<p>By the time the war broke out the <a href="Indian_Political_Intelligence_Office" title="wikilink">Indian Political Intelligence Office</a>, headed by <a href="John_Wallinger" title="wikilink">John Wallinger</a>, had expanded into Europe. In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the <a href="Secret_Service_Bureau" title="wikilink">Secret Service Bureau</a>. This network already had agents in <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> against possible German intrigues. After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Head Quarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the <a href="S&lt;U+00FB&gt;ret&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00FB&gt;ret&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was <a href="Somerset_Maugham" title="wikilink">Somerset Maugham</a>, who was recruited in <a href="1915" class="uri" title="wikilink">1915</a> and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe. A British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate <a href="Virendranath_Chattopadhaya" title="wikilink">Virendranath Chattopadhaya</a> while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet <a href="Mahendra_Pratap" title="wikilink">Mahendra Pratap</a> to offer Kaiser Wilhelm II's invitation. It is said that <a href="Somerset_Maugham" title="wikilink">Somerset Maugham</a> based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modelling the character of <a href="Ashenden:_Or_the_British_Agent" title="wikilink">John Ashenden</a> after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath. The short story of <em>Giulia Lazzari</em> is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and <a href="Mata_Hari" title="wikilink">Mata Hari</a>'s story. Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Czechoslovakia" title="wikilink">Czech</a> revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of <a href="Bagha_Jatin" title="wikilink">Bagha Jatin</a>'s plans. The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The American network, headed by <a href="E.V._Voska" title="wikilink">E.V.

Voska had began working with <a href="Guy_Gaunt" title="wikilink">Guy Gaunt</a>, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to <a href="Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt;_Masaryk" title="wikilink">Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt; Masaryk</a> who further passed on the information the American authorities.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of <em>The Caliph's Jihad</em>, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the <a href="Kabul_Mission" title="wikilink">Kabul Mission</a>.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="in-the-united-states">In the United States</h3>

<p>In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels. The activities of <a href="Ghadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghadar</a> on the Pacific coast were noted by <a href="W._C._Hopkinson" title="wikilink">W. C.

<p>The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the <a href="Lahore_Conspiracy_trial" title="wikilink">Lahore Conspiracy trial</a>, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny. Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the <a href="Defence_of_India_Act_1915" title="wikilink">Defence of India Act 1915</a> and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial.

Following the conclusion of the trial, diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a><a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="Hindu_German_Conspiracy_trial" title="wikilink">Hindu German Conspiracy trial</a> commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a> <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a> following the uncovering of the <a href="Annie_Larsen_affair" title="wikilink">Annie Larsen affair</a>. One hundred and five people participated, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco. The trial itself lasted from <a href="November_20" title="wikilink">November 20</a> <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a> to <a href="April_24" title="wikilink">April 24</a> <a href="1918" class="uri" title="wikilink">1918</a>. The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, <a href="Ram_Chandra_Bharadwaj" title="wikilink">Ram Chandra</a>, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom. Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a <a href="US_Marshal" title="wikilink">US Marshal</a>. In May 1917, eight Indian Nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain. In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an Imperialist war.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Strong public support in favour of the Indians, especially the revived Anglo-phobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a>, allowed the Ghadarite movement to revive despite British concerns.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<p>The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Alarmed at the agile organisation, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-Indian revolutions were spreading through India &quot;like some hidden fire&quot;.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> A massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement.

<h3 id="political-impact">Political impact</h3>


<p>The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a><a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p>In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the <a href="Defence_of_India_act,1915" title="wikilink">Defence of India Act of 1915</a>. Among the strongest proponents of the act was <a href="Michael_O&#39;Dwyer" title="wikilink">Michael O'Dwyer</a>, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> It was also a factor that guided British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of <a href="Montagu-Chelmsford_Reforms" title="wikilink">Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms</a> which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a><a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to <a href="Bolshevik_Russia" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Russia</a>, as well as a still active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a <a href="Rowlatt_committee" title="wikilink">Sedition committee</a> in 1918 chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the <a href="Rowlatt_Act" title="wikilink">Rowlatt Act</a>, an extension of the <a href="Defence_of_India_act_of_1915" title="wikilink">Defence of India act of 1915</a>, was enforced in India.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy. At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention. News of young <a href="Mohajir" title="wikilink">Mohajirs</a> who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a> during the <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a> was also beginning to reach India. The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> It was at this time that <a href="Gandhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandhi</a>, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader.</p>
<p>Ominously, in 1919, the <a href="third_Anglo-Afghan_war" title="wikilink">third Anglo-Afghan war</a> began in the wake of Amir <a href="Habibullah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Habibullah</a>'s assassination and institution of <a href="Amanullah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amanullah</a> in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission. In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that &quot;practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. Michael O'Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the <a href="1857_revolt" title="wikilink">1857 revolt</a>, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The <a href="Amritsar_massacre" title="wikilink">Amritsar massacre</a>, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> <a href="James_Houssemayne_Du_Boulay" title="wikilink">James Houssemayne Du Boulay</a> is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="international-relations">International relations</h3>

<p>The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all <a href="Anglo-American_relations" title="wikilink">Anglo-American relations</a> during the war, as well as, to some extent, Anglo-Chinese relations. After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced Anglo-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government. By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement. Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government, (especially of <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William_Jennings_Bryan" title="wikilink">William Jennings Bryan</a> who had eight years previously had authored a highly critical pamphlet called the &quot;<em>British rule in India</em>&quot; classified as seditionist by the Indian and Imperial governments), and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador Cecil-Spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a><a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> After <a href="Robert_Lansing" title="wikilink">Robert Lansing</a> replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in <a href="1916" class="uri" title="wikilink">1916</a>, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_India" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for India</a> <a href="Robert_Crewe-Milnes,_1st_Marquess_of_Crewe" title="wikilink">Marquess of Crewe</a> and Foreign Secretary <a href="Edward_Grey" title="wikilink">Edward Grey</a> forced Spring-Rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American Government in February. The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the <a href="Hindu_German_conspiracy_trial" title="wikilink">Hindu German conspiracy trial</a>.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the <a href="China_Station" title="wikilink">British far-eastern fleet</a> on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels. Seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel <em>China</em> by the 'HMS <em>Laurentic</em> at the mouth of the <a href="Yangtze_River" title="wikilink">Yangtze River</a>, followed by a number of incidents including the SS <em>Henry S</em>, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India, drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the <a href="United_States_Fleet_Forces_Command" title="wikilink">U. S. Atlantic Fleet</a> to dispatch Destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels. Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong. The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the <em>China</em> prisoners and released relaxed its aggressive policy seeking cooperation with the United States. However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a><a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by <a href="William_G._E._Wiseman" title="wikilink">William G. E. Wiseman</a>, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the <a href="New_York_Police" title="wikilink">New York Police</a> bypassing diplomatic channels. This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its Embassy to cooperate with the investigations resolving the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a><a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a><a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a><a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Through 1915-16, China (along with Indonesia) formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues. This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the <a href="Triple_Entente" title="wikilink">Entente powers</a>.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war. This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations as early as 1916.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> After the end of the Great War, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies. Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and <a href="A_M_Sahay" title="wikilink">A M Sahay</a>. The protections offered to these nationalists effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ghadar-party-and-iic">Ghadar Party and IIC</h3>
<p>The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with <a href="Communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communism</a> and the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> <a href="Bhupendranath_Dutta" title="wikilink">Bhupendranath Dutta</a> and <a href="Virendranath_Chattopadhyay" title="wikilink">Virendranath Chattopadhyay</a> alias Chatto arrived in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> in 1920. <a href="Narendranath_Bhattacharya" title="wikilink">Narendranath Bhattacharya</a>, under a new identity of <a href="M.N._Roy" title="wikilink">M.N.

He later fled <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> for <a href="Soviet_Russia" title="wikilink">Soviet Russia</a> but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's <a href="Great_Purge" title="wikilink">Great Purge</a>.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs. Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the <a href="Chinese_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Chinese Communist Party</a>.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a><a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h3>

<p>Although the conspiracy failed during World War I and the movement was suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand. The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably <a href="Subhas_Chandra_Bose" title="wikilink">Subhas Chandra Bose</a> who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination. During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking <a href="Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Axis support</a> to revive such a concept.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the <a href="Indische_Legion" title="wikilink">Indische Legion</a>, to fight in India against Britain.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> He would later return to Southeast Asia to take charge of the <a href="Indian_National_Army" title="wikilink">Indian National Army</a> which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like <a href="Mohan_Singh_Deb" title="wikilink">Mohan Singh</a>, <a href="Giani_Pritam_Singh" title="wikilink">Giani Pritam Singh</a>, and Rash Behari Bose. The most famous of these saw the formation of the <a href="Indian_Independence_League" title="wikilink">Indian Independence League</a> , the <a href="Indian_National_Army" title="wikilink">Indian National Army</a> and ultimately the <a href="Arzi_Hukumat-e-Azad_Hind" title="wikilink">Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind</a> in Southeast Asia.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> </p>

<p>The conspiracy is known under a number of different names, including the <strong>Hindu Conspiracy</strong>, the <strong>Indo-German Conspiracy</strong>, the <strong>Ghadar conspiracy</strong> (or <strong>Ghadr conspiracy</strong>), or the <strong>German plot</strong>.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a><a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a><a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a><a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> The term <em>Hindu-German Conspiracy</em> is closely associated with the uncovering of the <a href="Annie_Larsen_plot" title="wikilink">Annie Larsen plot</a> in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian Nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality. The trial itself was called the <a href="Hindu-German_Conspiracy_trial" title="wikilink">Hindu-German Conspiracy trial</a>, and the Conspiracy was reported in the media (and later studied by a number of historians) as Hindu-German Conspiracy.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> However, the Conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs as well, along with strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement. The term Hindu was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify <a href="Demographics_of_India" title="wikilink">Indians</a> regardless of religion. Likewise, conspiracy was also a negative term. The term <em>Hindu Conspiracy</em> was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>The term <em><a href="Ghadar_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">Ghadar Conspiracy</a></em> may also refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India. The term <em><a href="German_plot" title="wikilink">German plot</a></em> may also refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915. The term <em>Indo-German conspiracy</em> is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the <a href="Niedermayer-Hentig_mission" title="wikilink"> mission to Kabul</a> which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war. All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy. Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name Hindu-German Conspiracy, the Hindu-Conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term Indo-German conspiracy.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a><a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
