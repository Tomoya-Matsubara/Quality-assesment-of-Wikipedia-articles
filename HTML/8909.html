<p>The <strong>bombing of Banski dvori</strong> () was a <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> air strike on <a href="Banski_dvori" title="wikilink">Banski dvori</a> in <a href="Zagreb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zagreb</a>, during the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a>. The Banski dvori were the <a href="official_residence" title="wikilink">official residence</a> of the <a href="President_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">President of Croatia</a> at the time. The bombing occurred on 7 October 1991, when the <a href="Yugoslav_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Air Force</a> attacked Banski dvori and other targets in the <a href="Gradec,_Zagreb" title="wikilink">Gornji Grad</a> area of <a href="Zagreb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zagreb</a> and elsewhere in the Croatian capital city. Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets, however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21" title="wikilink">MiG-21s</a> carrying eight <em>Munja</em>  <a href="unguided_missile" title="wikilink">unguided missiles</a> each and two <a href="Soko_G-4_Super_Galeb" title="wikilink">Soko G-4 Super Galebs</a> carrying two <a href="Mark_82_bomb" title="wikilink">Mark 82 bombs</a> each. The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by <a href="proximity_fuze" title="wikilink">proximity fuzes</a>  above the target, scoring two direct hits. One civilian was reported killed by the aircraft <a href="strafing" class="uri" title="wikilink">strafing</a> of the <a href="Tu&lt;U+0161&gt;kanac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tu&lt;U+0161&gt;kanac</a> area of Gornji Grad and four were injured.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack Croatian President <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a> was in the building, meeting <a href="Stjepan_Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Stjepan Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, then <a href="President_of_the_Presidency_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Ante_Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Ante Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, the then <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of Yugoslavia</a>, both ethnic <a href="Croats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croats</a>—in an attempt to persuade Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government. None of them were injured in the attack. In immediate aftermath of the event, Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man said that the attack appeared to have been meant to destroy Banski dvori as the seat of the <a href="State_(polity)" title="wikilink">statehood</a> of Croatia. Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; blamed Yugoslav defence secretary <a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Veljko_Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Veljko Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> for the attack, demanding his resignation. The Yugoslav defence ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command and suggesting that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. In response, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> advised US nationals to leave Croatia. The <a href="United_States_Department_of_State" title="wikilink">United States Department of State</a> announced that it would consider introducing <a href="economic_sanctions" title="wikilink">economic sanctions</a> against Yugoslavia. <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> condemned the attack, calling it barbarous, and blamed it on the Yugoslav military.</p>
<p>After the bombing, the residence of the President of Croatia was moved from Banski dvori to the <a href="Presidential_Palace,_Zagreb" title="wikilink">Presidential palace</a>—formerly known as <em>Villa Zagorje</em>. The Banski dvori, and the surrounding buildings, sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. After the repairs, the building became the seat of the <a href="Government_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Government of Croatia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In 1991, the <a href="Croatian_parliamentary_election,_1990" title="wikilink">first multi-party elections</a> were held in <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>, with <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a>'s win raising nationalist tensions further in an already tense <a href="SFR_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">SFR Yugoslavia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <a href="Serbs_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Serb</a> politicians left the <a href="Sabor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabor</a> and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become part of the unrecognized <a href="Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina" title="wikilink">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a>, which had the intention on achieving independence from Croatia.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As tensions rose, Croatia <a href="Independence_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">declared independence</a> in June 1991. However, the declaration was suspended for three months, until 8 October 1991.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The suspension came about as the <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">European Economic Community</a> and the <a href="Conference_on_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> urged Croatia that it would not be recognized as an independent state because of the possibility of a civil war in Yugoslavia.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The tensions escalated into the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a> when the <a href="Yugoslav_National_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav National Army</a> and various Serb <a href="Paramilitary" title="wikilink">paramilitaries</a> mobilized inside Croatia.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On 3 October, the <a href="Yugoslav_Navy" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Navy</a> renewed its blockade of the main ports of Croatia. This move followed months of standoff and the capture of Yugoslav military installations in Dalmatia and elsewhere. These events are now known as the <a href="Battle_of_the_barracks" title="wikilink">Battle of the barracks</a>. That resulted in the capture of significant quantities of weapons, ammunition and other equipment by the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a>, including 150 <a href="armoured_personnel_carrier" title="wikilink">armoured personnel carriers</a>, 220 <a href="tank" title="wikilink">tanks</a> and 400 <a href="artillery" class="uri" title="wikilink">artillery</a> pieces of  <a href="Caliber_(artillery)" title="wikilink">caliber</a> or larger,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> 39 <a href="barracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">barracks</a> and 26 other facilities including two <a href="Military_communications" title="wikilink">signals centres</a> and a missile base.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It also coincided with the end of <a href="Operation_Coast-91" title="wikilink">Operation Coast-91</a>, in which the Yugoslav forces failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia's access to the rest of Croatia.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="warning-of-the-attack">Warning of the attack</h2>
<p><img src="Banski_dvori_2009.jpg" title="fig:Banski dvori" alt="Banski dvori" /> According to <a href="Martin_&lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj" title="wikilink">Martin &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj</a>, who held the post of <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">defense minister of Croatia</a> between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was informed by a Yugoslav Air Force <a href="&lt;U+017D&gt;eljava_Air_Base" title="wikilink">&lt;U+017D&gt;eljava Air Base</a>-based source about a top secret mission prepared for the next day, but &lt;U+0160&gt;pegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously due to lack of details.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by <a href="Croatian_security_and_intelligence_system" title="wikilink">Croatian security and intelligence system</a> services,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> indicating the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and its then-<a href="President_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">president</a> <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> as the source of the information.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> At midnight during the night of the 6–7 October, the Soviet ambassador to <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a> was reported to have received instructions to deliver a Soviet warning to the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb. The instructions contained information on imminent military action.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man spent the night in a <a href="Croatian_Air_Force_and_Air_Defence" title="wikilink">Croatian Air Force and Air Defence</a> command post—a tunnel running under the Gornji Grad—where information on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed. In the morning, Yugoslav General Andrija Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;eta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb as a form of pressure on Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Three <a href="air_raid_alarm" title="wikilink">air raid alarms</a> were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area, and numerous tip-offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases. During the morning, Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near <a href="Pula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pula</a> and <a href="Udbina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Udbina</a> in Croatia and <a href="Banja_Luka" title="wikilink">Banja Luka</a> in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No flights were recorded taking off from &lt;U+017D&gt;eljava Air Base, presumably because of low cloud cover in the area. At 1:30 pm, the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and <a href="radar" class="uri" title="wikilink">radar</a> post near <a href="Velika_Buna" title="wikilink">Velika Buna</a>, south of Zagreb, hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area. It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> the <a href="official_residence" title="wikilink">official residence</a> of the <a href="President_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">President of Croatia</a> at the time.<ref name="JL-Pantov<U+010D>ak&quot;/&gt;</p>

<p>Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man met with <a href="Stjepan_Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Stjepan Mesi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, then <a href="President_of_the_Presidency_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Ante_Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Ante Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, the then <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of Yugoslavia</a>, both ethnic <a href="Croats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croats</a>, in Banski dvori.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The purpose of the meeting was to persuade Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared reluctant to do,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The meeting was adjourned for lunch that was to be attended by presidential aides. Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man made another effort at persuading Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, trying to appeal to his Croatian origin. The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president's office to continue their discussion.

<p>Just after 3 pm, minutes after the lunch had ended, the <a href="Yugoslav_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Air Force</a> attacked Banski dvori and other targets in the <a href="Gradec,_Zagreb" title="wikilink">Gornji Grad</a> area of <a href="Zagreb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zagreb</a> and elsewhere in the Croatian capital city, two or three minutes after everyone had left the hall where the lunch was hosted.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21" title="wikilink">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s</a> carrying eight <em>Munja</em>  <a href="unguided_missile" title="wikilink">unguided missiles</a> each and two <a href="Soko_G-4_Super_Galeb" title="wikilink">Soko G-4 Super Galebs</a> carrying two <a href="Mark_82_bomb" title="wikilink">Mark 82 bombs</a> each.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by <a href="proximity_fuze" title="wikilink">proximity fuzes</a>  above the target,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> scoring two direct hits.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Spomen-ploca_Raketiranje_Banskih_dvora.jpg" title="fig:A plaque commemorating the attack was placed in 2011" alt="A plaque commemorating the attack was placed in 2011" /> In a television report taped and broadcast shortly after the bombing, Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man said that the attack appears to have been meant to destroy Banski dvori as the seat of the <a href="State_(polity)" title="wikilink">statehood</a> of Croatia, and as a <a href="decapitation_strike" title="wikilink">decapitation strike</a>. He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav defence secretary General <a href="Veljko_Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Veljko Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> for the attack. He demanded his resignation, threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt; was out of office. The Yugoslav defence ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command and suggesting that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted <a href="plastic_explosive" title="wikilink">plastic explosives</a> in Banski dvori.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the situation, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> <a href="consulate" class="uri" title="wikilink">consulate</a> advised American nationals, including journalists, to leave Croatia.
