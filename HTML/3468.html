<p>Mattheson was born and died in <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>. He was a close friend of <a href="George_Frideric_Handel" title="wikilink">George Frideric Handel</a>, although he nearly killed him in a sudden quarrel, during a performance of Mattheson's opera <em>Cleopatra</em> in 1704. Handel was saved only by a large button which turned aside Mattheson's sword. The two were afterwards reconciled.</p>
<p>The son of a well-to-do tax collector, Mattheson received a broad liberal education and, aside from general musical training, took lessons in <a href="keyboard_instrument" title="wikilink">keyboard instruments</a>, <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a>, <a href="musical_composition" title="wikilink">composition</a> and <a href="singing" class="uri" title="wikilink">singing</a>. By age nine he was singing and playing <a href="pipe_organ" title="wikilink">organ</a> in church and was a member of the chorus of the Hamburg opera. He made his solo debut with the Hamburg opera in 1696 in female roles and, after his voice changed, sang <a href="tenor" class="uri" title="wikilink">tenor</a> at the opera, conducted rehearsals and composed operas himself. He was cantor at the cathedral from 1718 until increasing <a href="deafness" class="uri" title="wikilink">deafness</a> led to his retirement from that post.</p>
<p>Mattheson's chief occupation from 1706 was as a professional diplomat. He had studied <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> in school and spoke it fluently. He became tutor to the son of the English ambassador Sir <a href="John_Wich" title="wikilink">John Wich</a> and then secretary to the ambassador. He went on diplomatic missions abroad representing the ambassador. In 1709 he married an English woman.</p>
<p>After his death in 1764, Johann Mattheson was buried in the vault of Hamburg's <a href="St._Michaelis_(Hamburg)" title="wikilink">St. Michaelis' Church</a> where his grave can be visited to this day.</p>
<p>Mattheson is mainly famous as a music theorist. He was the most thorough writer on performance practice, theatrical style, and harmony of the German <a href="Baroque_music" title="wikilink">Baroque</a>. In addition to some original work—particularly on the relationship of the disciplines of <a href="rhetoric" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhetoric</a> and music—he was a compiler of most of the ideas current at the time.</p>
<p>The bulk of his compositional output was vocal, including eight <a href="opera" title="wikilink">operas</a>, and numerous <a href="oratorio" title="wikilink">oratorios</a> and <a href="cantata" title="wikilink">cantatas</a>. He also wrote a few <a href="sonata_(music)" title="wikilink">sonatas</a> and some keyboard music, including pieces meant for keyboard instruction. All of his music, except for one opera, one oratorio, and a few collections of instrumental music, went missing with the spoils of war after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, but was given back to <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a> by <a href="Yerevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yerevan</a> (<a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a>) in 1998. This includes four Operas and most of the oratorios. The manuscripts are now located at the Staats and Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;tsbibliothek Hamburg, former Hamburg Stadtbibliothek.</p>
