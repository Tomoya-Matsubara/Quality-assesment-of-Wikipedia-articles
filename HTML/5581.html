<p>Sainsbury's was founded in 1869 by <a href="John_James_Sainsbury" title="wikilink">John James Sainsbury</a> and his wife Mary Ann (<a href="n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> Staples), in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, and grew rapidly during the Victorian era. It grew to become the largest <a href="grocery" class="uri" title="wikilink">grocery</a> retailer in 1922, pioneered self-service retailing in the UK, and its heyday was during the 1980s. As a result of being complacent during the 1990s, <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a> became the market leader in 1995, and Asda became the second-largest in 2003, demoting Sainsbury's into third place.</p>
<p>The founding <a href="Sainsbury_family" title="wikilink">Sainsbury family</a> still retain approximately 15% of J Sainsbury plc shares (as of May 2008), through various trusts. The family sold down their stake from 35% in 2005. The largest family shareholders are <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Turville" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Turville</a> with 5.83% and <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Preston_Candover" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover</a>, who controls just under 3% of the company, and benefits from 1.6% of the equity included in the above.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="the-victorian-era">The Victorian era</h3>
<p><img src="Sainsbury&#39;s.jpg" title="fig:Sainsbury&#39;s at the White Rose Shopping Centre in Leeds" alt="Sainsbury&#39;s at the White Rose Shopping Centre in Leeds" /> Sainsbury's was established as a partnership in 1869 when <a href="John_James_Sainsbury" title="wikilink">John James Sainsbury</a> and his wife Mary Ann opened a store at 173 Drury Lane in <a href="Holborn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holborn</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar. His trading philosophy, as stated on a sign outside his first shop in Islington, was &quot;Quality perfect, prices lower&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It was very innovative in that its stores, instead of featuring five own-brand lines like arch-rival <a href="Home_and_Colonial" title="wikilink">Home and Colonial</a>, it offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison. Instead of saw dust floors and wooden counters, Sainsbury's boasted marble counters, mosaic floors and white-tiled walls. Staff even had a uniform of white aprons. Stores started to look similar, so people could recognise them throughout London, a high cast iron 'J. SAINSBURY.' sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and round-the-back deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to Sainsbury's popularity.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1922 J Sainsbury was incorporated as a private company, as 'J. Sainsbury Limited', when it became the UK's largest grocery group.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>By this time each store had six departments: dairy, bacon and hams, poultry and game, cooked meats and fresh meats. Groceries were not introduced until 1903 when John James purchased a grocer's branch at 12 Kingsland High Street, Dalston. Home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days. Sites were carefully chosen, with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop. This allowed a larger display of products, which could be kept cooler in summer, which was important as there was no refrigeration.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>By the time John James Sainsbury died in 1928, there were 128 shops. His last words were said to be 'Keep the shops well lit', and he was replaced by his eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, who went into partnership with his father in 1915.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-interwar-years-and-the-second-world-war">The Interwar years and the Second World War</h3>
<p>During the 1930s and 1940s, with the company now run by John James Sainsbury's eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, the company continued to refine its product offer and maintain its leadership in terms of store design, convenience and cleanliness.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The company acquired the Midlands-based Thoroughgood chain in 1936.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Alan Sainsbury, the founder's grandson (later <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Drury_Lane" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Drury Lane</a>) became joint managing director of Sainsbury's along with his brother <a href="Sir_Robert_Sainsbury" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Sainsbury</a> in 1938 after their father, John Benjamin Sainsbury, had a minor heart attack.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, many of the men that worked for Sainsbury's were called to do National Service and were replaced by women. Given Sainsbury's reputation for quality foods at fair prices, the Second World War were difficult times for Sainsbury's, as with most of its stores trading in the <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> area, a lot of them got bombed or damaged. Turnover fell to half the pre-war level. Food was rationed, and one particular store in <a href="East_Grinstead" title="wikilink">East Grinstead</a> was so badly damaged on Friday 9 July 1943, that it had to move to the local Church as a temporary replacement, whilst a new one was built. This store was not completed until 1951.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pioneering-self-service-supermarkets">Pioneering self-service supermarkets</h3>
<p>In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became Chairman after his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury's death.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> During the 1950s and 1960s Sainsbury's pioneered self-service supermarkets. On a trip to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> of America, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of self-service stores, and believed the future of Sainsbury's was self-service supermarkets of , with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The first self-service branch opened in <a href="London_Borough_of_Croydon" title="wikilink">Croydon</a> in 1950.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Sainsbury's was a pioneer in the development of own-brand goods; the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods, but at a lower price.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It expanded more cautiously than Tesco, shunning acquisitions, and it never offered trading stamps.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sainsburys-heyday">Sainsbury's heyday</h3>
<p>Until the company went public on 12 July 1973, as J Sainsbury plc, the company was wholly owned by the Sainsbury family. It was at the time the largest ever flotation on the <a href="London_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">London Stock Exchange</a>;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible. A million shares were set aside for staff, which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value. Within one minute the list of applications was closed: &lt;U+00A3&gt;495 million had been offered for &lt;U+00A3&gt;14.5 million available shares. The Sainsbury family at the time retained 85% of the firm's shares. The feverish press that surrounded the flotation greatly enhanced the company's new dynamic image.</p>
<p>The company benefited, too, from a consistency of management stemming from family ownership and control. The fact that it did not go public until 1973 was not a disadvantage; unlike <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a>, Sainsbury's grew organically rather than by takeovers, and, at least during this period, did not need to use its shares as an acquisition currency. Sainsbury's had the advantage, shared to some extent by Tesco, of a strong market position in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> and the South East.</p>
<p>Most of the senior positions were held by family members; John Davan Sainsbury (later <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Preston_Candover" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover</a>),<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> a member of the fourth generation of the founding family, took over the chairmanship from his uncle <a href="Sir_Robert_Sainsbury" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Sainsbury</a> in 1969, who had been chairman for two years from 1967 following Alan Sainsbury's retirement.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's started to replace its  High Street stores with self-service supermarkets above , which were either in out-of-town locations or in regenerated town centres. Sainsbury's policy was to invest in uniform, well-designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality; its slogan was &quot;good food costs less at Sainsbury's&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> During the 1970s the average size of Sainsbury's stores rose from  to around ; the first edge-of-town store, with  of selling space, was opened in <a href="Cambridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> in <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>. The last counter service branch closed in <a href="Peckham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peckham</a> in <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Although these larger stores contained some non-food items, they were not intended to match what <a href="Asda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asda</a> had been doing in the north; Sainsbury's focused more single-mindedly on food.</p>
<p>To participate in the hypermarket sector, Sainsbury's formed a joint venture, known as <a href="SavaCentre" class="uri" title="wikilink">SavaCentre</a>, with <a href="British_Home_Stores" title="wikilink">British Home Stores</a>. The first SavaCentre store was opened in <a href="Washington,_Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Washington, Tyne and Wear</a>, in 1977;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> nearly half the space, amounting to some , was devoted to textiles, electrical goods and hardware. As the hypermarket format became more mainstream, with rivals such as <a href="Asda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asda</a> and <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a> launching ever-larger stores, it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular Sainsbury's superstore format in 1999.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This is in direct contrast to rival firms Tesco and ASDA, which have been rapidly expanding their <em>Tesco Extra</em> and <em>ASDA Wal-Mart Supercentre</em> hypermarket formats in recent years.</p>
<p>Another diversification took place in 1979, when Sainsbury's formed a joint venture with the Belgian retailer, GB-Inno-BM, to set up a chain of do-it-yourself stores under the <a href="Homebase" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homebase</a> name.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The plan was to open a DIY store with a supermarket-style layout. Homebase was tripled in size in 1995 with the acquisition of the rival <a href="Texas_Homecare" title="wikilink">Texas Homecare</a> from the Ladbroke Group plc. Sainsbury's sold the Homebase chain in December 2000 in a two-fold deal worth <a href="GBP" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>969 million. Sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist <a href="Schroder_Ventures" title="wikilink">Schroder Ventures</a> generated &lt;U+00A3&gt;750 million and sale of 28 development sites, which had been earmarked for future Homebase stores, were sold for &lt;U+00A3&gt;219 million to rival B&amp;Q's parent company, <a href="Kingfisher_plc" title="wikilink">Kingfisher plc</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The company's growth was still largely based on food, with only a modest contribution from the SavaCentre business (of which Sainsbury's took full control in 1989). There was, however, diversification outside the UK.</p>
<p>In November 1983 Sainsbury's purchased 21% of <a href="Shaw&#39;s_Supermarkets" title="wikilink">Shaw's Supermarkets</a>, the second largest grocery group in the north-east United States. In June 1987, Sainsbury's acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a high-quality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the UK-based operation.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1985 the Chairman reported that over the preceding ten years profits had grown from &lt;U+00A3&gt;15 million to over &lt;U+00A3&gt;168 million, a compound annual rise of 30.4% &lt;U+2013&gt; after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of 17.6%.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1980s the Company invested in new technology: the proportion of sales passing through EPOS scanning checkouts rose from 1% to 90%.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Sainsbury's expanded its operation into <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> with a store in <a href="Darnley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darnley</a> opening in January 1992, (the SavaCentre at <a href="Cameron_Toll" title="wikilink">Cameron Toll</a> in Edinburgh had opened in 1984). In June 1995 Sainsbury's announced its intention to move into the Northern Ireland market, until that point dominated by local companies.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Between December 1996 and December 1998 the company opened seven stores. Two others at <a href="Sprucefield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sprucefield</a>, Lisburn and <a href="Holywood_Exchange" title="wikilink">Holywood Exchange</a>, Belfast would not open until 2003 due to protracted legal challenges. Sainsbury's move into Northern Ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of Tesco. While Sainsbury's outlets were all new developments, Tesco (apart from one Tesco Metro) instead purchased existing chains from <a href="Associated_British_Foods" title="wikilink">Associated British Foods</a> (see <a href="Tesco_Ireland" title="wikilink">Tesco Ireland</a>).</p>
<p>In 1991, the group boasted a 12-year record of dividend increases of 20% or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Also in 1991 the company raised &lt;U+00A3&gt;489 million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sainsburys-downfall">Sainsbury's downfall</h3>
<p>In 1992 the long-time CEO <a href="John_Sainsbury,_Baron_Sainsbury_of_Preston_Candover" title="wikilink">John Davan Sainsbury</a> retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin, David Sainsbury (later <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Turville" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Turville</a>); this brought about a change in management style - David was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the company's place in the market.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Mistakes by David Sainsbury and his successors, Dino Adriano and <a href="Sir_Peter_Davis" title="wikilink">Peter Davis</a>, included the rejection of loyalty cards, the reluctance to move into non-food retailing, the indecision between whether to go quality or for value, &quot;the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers&quot; which led to suppliers favouring Tesco over Sainsbury's and the unsuccessful <a href="John_Cleese" title="wikilink">John Cleese</a> advertising campaign.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of 1993 it announced price cuts on 300 of its most popular own-label lines. Significantly, this came three months after <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a> had launched its Tesco Value line.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> A few months later Sainsbury's announced that margins had fallen, that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down, and that it would write down the value of some of its properties.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994 Sainsbury's announced a new town-centre format, Sainsbury's Central, again a response to Tesco's Metro, which was already established in five locations.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Also in 1994 Sainsbury's lost the takeover battle for <a href="William_Low" title="wikilink">William Low</a> (like Tesco, Sainsbury's had long been under-represented in Scotland).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Also that year David Sainsbury dismissed Tesco's clubcard initiative as 'an electronic version of <a href="Green_Shield_Stamps" title="wikilink">Green Shield Stamps</a>'; the company was soon forced to backtrack, introducing its own Reward Card 18 months later.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>For much of the 20th century Sainsbury's had been the market leader in the UK supermarket sector, but in 1996 it lost its place as the UK's largest grocer to <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Some new ventures were successful, notably the launch of a retail bank, <a href="Sainsbury&#39;s_Bank" title="wikilink">Sainsbury's Bank</a>, in partnership with <a href="Bank_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Bank of Scotland</a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to Shaw's, Sainsbury's bought a minority stake in another supermarket group, Giant Food, based in <a href="Washington_DC" title="wikilink">Washington DC</a>,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> although this shareholding was subsequently sold when <a href="Ahold" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ahold</a> of the Netherlands made a full bid for the company.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's also trebled the size of its <a href="Homebase" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homebase</a> do-it-yourself business in 1996 by buying <a href="Texas_Homecare" title="wikilink">Texas Homecare</a> from Ladbroke for &lt;U+00A3&gt;290 million.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to expansion of larger formats and banking services, Sainsbury's decided to provide shopping services to small towns, which led to the construction of &quot;Country Town&quot; stores. These were small supermarkets which enabled large villages to get their weekly shopping without travelling to large out of town stores. These &quot;Country Town&quot; stores were opened mainly across the south east which is historically Sainsbury's strongest market. Potential sites were identified and finally stores were opened in Attleborough and Chipping Ongar(Essex) towards the end of 1998. The &quot;Country Town&quot; format may now be discontinued but the stores which were completed have now been brought up to standard with the rest of the companies portfolio and continue to trade strongly even with many having larger stores within 10 minutes travel from the &quot;&quot;Country Town&quot; stores.</p>
<p>In 1996 the company reported its first fall in profits for 22 years. David Sainsbury announced management changes, involving the appointment of two chief executives, one in charge of UK supermarkets (Dino Adriano) and the other responsible for Homebase and the US (David Bremner).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, in 1998, David Sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He was succeeded as non-executive chairman by George Bull, who had been chairman of <a href="Diageo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diageo</a>,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and Adriano was promoted to be Group <a href="Chief_executive" title="wikilink">Chief executive</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-brand-re-launch">The brand re-launch</h3>
<p>In June 1999 Sainsbury's unveiled its new <a href="corporate_identity" title="wikilink">corporate identity</a>, which was developed by <a href="M&amp;C_Saatchi" title="wikilink">M&amp;C Saatchi</a>, which consisted of the current company logo (right), new corporate colours of &quot;living orange&quot; and blue, <a href="Interstate_(typeface)" title="wikilink">Interstate</a> as the company's general use font, the new <a href="slogan" class="uri" title="wikilink">slogan</a> &quot;Making life taste better&quot;, which replaced their old slogan from the 1960s and new staff uniforms.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The strapline was dropped in May 2005 and replaced in September of that year by &quot;Try something new today.&quot; While the Interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years, the company introduced another informal font in 2005 which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature.</p>
<p>In 1999 Sainsbury's acquired an 80.1% share of Egyptian Distribution Group SAE, a retailer in Egypt with 100 stores and 2,000 employees. However poor profitability led to the sale of this share in 2001.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> On 8 October 1999 the CEO Dino Adriano lost control of the core UK supermarket business, instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group. David Bremner became head of the UK supermarkets. This was &quot;derided&quot; by the city<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and described as a &quot;fudge&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On 14 January 2000 Sainsbury's reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of Adriano by Sir Peter Davis effective from March.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="business-transformation-programme">Business Transformation Programme</h3>
<p>Between 2000-2004, <a href="Sir_Peter_Davis" title="wikilink">Sir Peter Davis</a> was chief executive of Sainsbury's. Davis' appointment was well received by investors and analysts.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The appointment was only confirmed after Sainsbury's was sure of the support of the Sainsbury family, who snubbed Davis' offer of becoming chief executive in the early 1990s, following which he became Chief Executive of <a href="Prudential_plc" title="wikilink">Prudential plc</a>.</p>
<p>In his first two years he exceeded profit targets, although by 2004 the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the UK grocery market. Davis also oversaw an almost &lt;U+00A3&gt;3 billion upgrade of stores, distribution and IT equipment, entitled 'Business Transformation Programme', but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal - improving availability. Part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots, which at &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 million each cost four times more than standard depots.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="headquarters">Headquarters</h3>
<p>In 2001, Sainsbury's moved into its current headquarters at Holborn, London. Sainsbury's previously occupied <a href="Stamford_House" title="wikilink">Stamford House</a> and 12 other buildings around <a href="Southwark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southwark</a>. However the accounting department remained separate at <a href="Streatham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Streatham</a>.

<h3 id="safeway-takeover">Safeway takeover</h3>
<p>In 2003 <a href="Wm_Morrison_Supermarkets" title="wikilink">Wm Morrison Supermarkets</a> (trading as Morrisons) made an offer for the <a href="Safeway_(UK)" title="wikilink">Safeway</a> group, prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets. The <a href="Trade_and_Industry_Secretary" title="wikilink">Trade and Industry Secretary</a>, <a href="Patricia_Hewitt" title="wikilink">Patricia Hewitt</a>, referred the various bids to the <a href="Competition_Commission" title="wikilink">Competition Commission</a> which reported its findings on 26 September. The Commission found that all bids, with the exception of Morrison's, would &quot;operate against the public interest&quot;. As part of the approval Morrison's was to dispose of 53 of the combined group's stores. In May 2004 Sainsbury's announced that it would acquire 14 of these stores (13 Safeway stores and 1 Morrison's outlet) located primarily in the Midlands and the North of England.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>At the end of March 2004 Davis was promoted to <a href="chairman" class="uri" title="wikilink">chairman</a> and was replaced as CEO by <a href="Justin_King_(businessman)" title="wikilink">Justin King</a>. In June 2004 Davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses. Investors were angered by a bonus share award of over &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 million despite poor company performance. On 19 July 2004 Davis' replacement, Philip Hampton, was appointed as chairman.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Justin King joined Sainsbury's in 2004 from <a href="Marks_and_Spencer_plc" title="wikilink">Marks and Spencer plc</a> where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and Kings Super Markets, Inc. subsidiary in the United States.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Schooled in Solihull and a graduate of the University Of Bath, where he took a business administration degree, King was also previously a managing director at <a href="Asda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asda</a> with responsibility for hypermarkets.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>King ordered a direct mail campaign to 1 million Sainsbury's customers as part of his 6 month business review asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve. This reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts - the group was not ensuring that shelves are fully stocked, this due to the failure of the IT systems introduced by <a href="Sir_Peter_Davis" title="wikilink">Peter Davis</a>. On 19 October 2004 King unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the company's fortunes - in a three year recovery plan entitled 'Making Sainsbury's Great Again'.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> This was generally well received by both the stock market and the media. Immediate plans included laying off 750 headquarters staff and the recruitment of around 3,000 shop-floor staff to improve the quality of service and the firm's main problem: stock availability. The aim would be to increase sales revenue by &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.5 billion by the financial year ending March 2008. Another significant announcement was the halving of the <a href="dividend" class="uri" title="wikilink">dividend</a> to increase funds available for price cuts and quality.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>King hired Lawrence Christensen as supply chain director in 2004. Previously he was an expert in logistics at <a href="Safeway_(UK)" title="wikilink">Safeway</a>, but left following its takeover by <a href="Morrisons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morrisons</a>. Immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres. In 2006 Christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by Davis, saying &quot;not a single day went by without one, if not all of them, breaking down... The systems were flawed. They have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance. But because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up. It was a vicious circle.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once, rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> At the time of the business review on 19 October 2004, referring to the availability problems, Justin King said &quot;Lawrence hadn't seen anything that he hadn't seen before. He just hadn't seen them all in the same place at the same time&quot;. In 2007 Sainsbury's announced a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;12 million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>On 2 February 2007, after months of speculation about a private equity bid, <a href="CVC_Capital_Partners" title="wikilink">CVC Capital Partners</a>, <a href="Kohlberg_Kravis_Roberts" title="wikilink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</a> (KKR) and <a href="Blackstone_Group" title="wikilink">Blackstone Group</a> announced that they were considering a bid for Sainsbury's.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The consortium grew to include <a href="Goldman_Sachs" title="wikilink">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="Texas_Pacific_Group" title="wikilink">Texas Pacific Group</a>. On 6 March 2007, with a formal bid yet to be tabled, the Takeover Panel issued a bid deadline of 13 April.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>On 4 April KKR left the consortium to focus on its bid for <a href="Alliance_Boots" title="wikilink">Alliance Boots</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> On 5 April the consortium submitted an &quot;indicative offer&quot; of 562p a share to the company's board. After discussions between Sir Philip Hampton and the two largest Sainsbury family shareholders <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Turville" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Turville</a> and <a href="Lord_Sainsbury_of_Preston_Candover" title="wikilink">Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover</a> the offer was rejected.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> On 9 April the indicative offer was raised to 582p a share, however this too was rejected. This meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid, most importantly 75% shareholder support; the combined Sainsbury family holding at the time was 18%.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who then held 7.75% of Sainsbury's, stated that he could see no reason why the Sainsbury's board would even consider opening its books for due diligence for anything less than 600p per share.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> He believed any offer at that stage of Sainsbury's recovery was likely to undervalue the business,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, saw no reason to sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> He claimed the bid 'brought nothing to the business', and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long-term, which would have an adverse effect on Sainsbury's stakeholders.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>On 11 April the CVC-led consortium abandoned its offer, stating &quot;it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="recovery-to-growth">Recovery to growth</h3>
<p>In May 2007 Sainsbury's identified five areas of focus to take the company from recovery to growth:<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Great food at fair prices&quot;</li>
<li>Growth of non-food ranges</li>

<li>Expansion of supermarket space through new stores and development of the company's &quot;largely underdeveloped store portfolio&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Active property management&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delta-two-takeover-bid">Delta Two takeover bid</h3>
<p>On 25 April 2007 Delta Two, a Qatari investment company, bought a 14% stake in Sainsbury's causing its share price to rise 7.17%, which was then upped to 17.6%. Their interest in Sainsbury's is thought to centre on its property portfolio. They increased their stake to 25% in June 2007.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>On 18 July 2007 BBC News reported that Delta Two had tabled a conditional bid proposal.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Paul Taylor, the principal of Delta Two, flew David and John Sainsbury to <a href="Sardinia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sardinia</a> to reveal and discuss the potential bid which amounted to 600p per share.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The family had reservations about the price of the bid. Secondly, they were concerned about the proposed structure which involved splitting the business into an operating company and a highly-leveraged property company. Thirdly, they were concerned about adequacy of funding both for the bid and for the company's pension scheme.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>On 5 November 2007 it was announced Delta Two had abandoned its takeover bid due to the &quot;<a href="credit_crunch" title="wikilink">deterioration of credit markets</a>&quot; and concerns about funding the company's pension scheme.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

The new office will be part of a new complex to allow for both cost savings and energy efficiency. These savings will be made through the use of efficient building materials and design, a combined heat and power energy centre and the use of renewable energy sources.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2008 Sainsbury's brought its number of Northern Ireland supermarkets to 11 with the purchase of two Curley's Supermarkets in Dungannnon and Belfast, which includes those stores' petrol stations and off licences.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>Traditionally, the majority of Sainsbury's stores were located in the areas around <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> and south-east England. The company acquired the Midlands-based Thoroughgood in the 1930s. Expansion since 1945 has given the company national reach, although the chain is not as represented in Scotland as other chains such as Tesco, and Morrisons (as Safeway dominated Scotland before being taken over by that company). This is partly due to the fact that Sainsbury's lost out to Tesco in the bidding war for <a href="William_Low" title="wikilink">William Low</a> in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Sainsbury's stores have received a new look. The old 'J Sainsbury' name, used in various forms since 1869, was scrapped and replaced by 'Sainsbury's'. Most stores were refurbished with dark blue walls, bright orange wall panels and grey shelving, as well as new checkouts. Individual counters also have different brightly coloured panels behind them. The new flagship store in <a href="Greenwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>, South London, was the first to receive this new look, leading to the term 'Greenwich Blue', which is used to describe the signature coloour of a typical store. This format was subsequently rolled out across the entire store estate.</p>
<p>Following the introduction of the 'Try something new today' slogan in 2005, stores were again refurbished with cream walls, and dark red and dark blue signage, along with cream coloured shelving and checkouts. New purple-coloured staff uniforms have been introduced to all stores.</p>
<p>As of 2009, somne store still bear the old 'J Sainsbury' logo on external signage, including one branch in Princess Square, <a href="Bracknell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bracknell</a>, another in the centre of <a href="Welwyn_Garden_City" title="wikilink">Welwyn Garden City</a>, and the branch in <a href="Kirkcaldy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kirkcaldy</a>, which opened in 1997.</p>
<h3 id="supermarkets-and-hypermarkets">Supermarkets and hypermarkets</h3>
<p><img src="Sainsbury&#39;sCropped.jpg" title="fig:Interior of Sainsbury&#39;s Gloucester Quays store" alt="Interior of Sainsbury&#39;s Gloucester Quays store" /> The largest format of stores is internally branded 'Main Plus'. These are hypermarkets, which between 1977 and 2005 were branded as '<a href="Sainsbury&#39;s_SavaCentre" title="wikilink">Sainsbury's SavaCentre</a>'. However, as they got more integrated into the main chain, these stores were re-branded under the main Sainsbury's brand. This happened both in terms of back-office administration (the SavaCentre HQ In <a href="Wokingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wokingham</a> closed down in the 1990s) and in terms of store decoration, (which became identical to the Sainsbury's 'Main Mission' outlets). They occupy a wide range of both grocery and non-food, as a 50:50 split similar to <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a> Extra, and can therefore accommodate the weekly shop and more. These large stores have over  of sales area, and original SavaCentre's include <a href="Merton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merton</a>, <a href="London_Colney" title="wikilink">London Colney</a> and <a href="Sydenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydenham</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, and Calcot in <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a>. A large  'Main Plus' store is planned for <a href="Slough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slough</a>, on the site of the old Co-op store, which Tesco used while they were building their controversial  Extra store, currently the largest in the UK.</p>
<p>The core 'Main Mission' store format, which is a typical Sainsbury's supermarket, is between  and . The average size of a Sainsbury's supermarket is , the lowest amongst the 'Big Four'. This is because Sainsbury's were criticised for not building larger stores and extending its SavaCentre format in the 1990s. They concentrate on the weekly family shop. Food and non-food are split two thirds and one-third respectively. Typical counters include Food to Go, Fishmonger, Butcher, Delicatessen, Bakery, Salad Bar and Beers, Wines and Spirits.</p>
<p>Both of the above formats trade simply as Sainsbury's, so you cannot tell which format you are in unless you know what to look for. Customers will notice a larger product range, particularly non-food in a 'Main Plus' store. Sainsbury's now has many large stores, especially its Flagship Stores, such as <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a>(Hedge End), London(Colney) and Hayes(Middlesex)</p>
<h3 id="convenience-stores">Convenience stores</h3>
<p>Most of the major chains: Sainsbury's, <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a>, <a href="Marks_and_Spencer" title="wikilink">Marks and Spencer</a>, <a href="Somerfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerfield</a> and <a href="The_Co-operative_brand" title="wikilink">The Co-operative</a> operate convenience stores; as of 2008, <a href="Asda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asda</a> and <a href="Morrisons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morrisons</a> do not have presence in this area of the market.</p>
<p>The 'Mixed Mission' format incorporates the <a href="Sainsbury&#39;s_Central" title="wikilink">Sainsbury's Central</a> and <a href="Sainsbury&#39;s_Local" title="wikilink">Sainsbury's Local</a> formats. Sainsbury's Central stores are between  and , which is a mini supermarket, and Sainsbury's Local stores are between  and  in size, carrying a top-up shop and grab-and-go offer. Sainsbury's Local stores have different decoration to the other two formats - 'Main Mission' and 'Main Plus'.</p>
<p>The Sainsbury's Local stores on Shell petrol forecourts are set to close down due to being unprofitable.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's Central will eventually be phased out, to be replaced by the Sainsbury's 'Main Mission' format. This was announced in 2004, but several Sainsbury's Central stores, including <a href="Croydon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croydon</a>, <a href="Holborn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holborn</a>, <a href="Tottenham_Court_Road" title="wikilink">Tottenham Court Road</a>, <a href="Cardiff_Queen_Street" title="wikilink">Cardiff Queen Street</a>, <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> and <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a>, have yet to be refurbished and converted.</p>
<p>As well as its own Local and Central stores Sainsbury's has expanded through acquisition of existing chains (<a href="Bell&#39;s_Stores" title="wikilink">Bell's Stores</a>, <a href="Jackson&#39;s_Stores" title="wikilink">Jackson's Stores</a>, JB Beaumont, and SL Shaw Ltd).</p>
<p>Sainsbury's initially retained the strong Bells and Jacksons brands. For example, refurbished stores were called <em>Sainsbury's at Bells</em> or <em>Sainsbury's at Jacksons</em>. These were effectively Sainsbury's Local stores with a revised fascia, retaining some features of the former local chain. Unrefurbished stores retained the original brand and logo, but still offered Sainsbury's own brand products, pricing and some point of sale, without accepting Nectar cards. The old websites were also retained with some Sainsbury's branding.</p>
<p>This was an experimental format and on 4 May 2007 it was announced that all stores would be re branded as Sainsbury's Local, with the management teams of the smaller stores integrated into Sainsbury's own teams.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<p>Since 2000 <a href="Jamie_Oliver" title="wikilink">Jamie Oliver</a> has been the public face of Sainsbury's, appearing on television and radio advertisements and in-store promotional material. The deal earns him an estimated &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.2 million every year. In the first two years these advertisements are estimated to have given Sainsbury's an extra &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 billion of sales or &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 million gross profit.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>Sainsbury's currently uses the &quot;Try something new today&quot; slogan which was launched in an effort to make consumers venture into purchasing more varied goods. The television adverts are also often accompanied by <a href="The_Polyphonic_Spree" title="wikilink">The Polyphonic Spree's</a> Light &amp; Day. Over the years, Sainsbury's has used many slogans:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Quality perfect, Prices Lower&quot;</em> The slogan used on the shop-front of the Islington store in 1882.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Sainsbury's For Quality, Sainsbury's For Value&quot;</em>- Used in 1918 above the Drury Lane store.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Sainsbury's. Essentials for the Essentials.</em>&quot;</li>
<li><em>&quot;Good Food Costs Less At Sainsbury's&quot;</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; Used from the 1960s to the 1990s. Described by BBC News as &quot;probably the best-known advertising slogan in retailing.&quot; <a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Sainsbury's - Everyone's Favourite Ingredient&quot;</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; Used in a series of TV commercials in the 1990s which featured celebrities cooking Sainsbury's food.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Fresh food, fresh ideas. Eat healthy&quot;-used in 1998</em></li>
<li><em>&quot;Value to shout about&quot;</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; A 1998/1999 campaign fronted by <a href="John_Cleese" title="wikilink">John Cleese</a> which was widely claimed to have been a major mistake. Sainsbury's said it actually depressed sales. However, the company had been losing sales for years because of the rise of rival <a href="Tesco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tesco</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></li>
<li><em>&quot;Making Life Taste Better&quot;</em> Introduced 1999 and used until May 2005.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Try something new today&quot;</em> Introduced in September 2005. Replaced on carrier bags, till receipts and all other corporate branding from this point.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2008 they created a shopping incentive by showing that, when shopping at Sainsbury's, you can feed your family for only five pounds. The incentive, called &quot;<em>Feed your family for a fiver</em>&quot;, with the flagship of <em>&quot;Meatballs 'n' More&quot;</em> has been advertised on British television channels, with Jamie Oliver cooking for a family.</p>

</figure>
<p>A large store typically stocks around 50,000 lines of which around 20% are &quot;own-label&quot; goods. These own-brand lines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basics: an economy range of around 500 lines, mainly food but also including other areas such as toiletries and stationery. The Basics range uses minimal packaging with simple orange and white designs, to keep the price as low as possible. Sainsbury's Local stores sell none or very few of these lines. Equivalent to Tesco's Value, ASDA's Smart price and Morrison's Value</li>
<li>Taste the Difference: around 1100 premium food lines, including many processed foods such as ready made meals and premium bakery lines. Similar to ASDA's Extra Special, Tesco Finest and Morrison's The Best.</li>
<li>Different by Design: a smaller range of premium non-food lines, including flowers which were previously branded &quot;Orlando Hamilton&quot;.</li>
<li>Kids: these lines are for children. In 2006 these lines replaced the Blue Parrot Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; range.</li>
<li>Be Good To Yourself: products with reduced calorific and/or fat content.</li>
<li>Free From: over 75 product lines.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> These products are suitable for those allergic to dairy products. (The majority of these are dairy and gluten/wheat free)</li>
<li>Sainsbury's Organic (SO Organic): Around 500 lines of food / drink which is not derived from food stuffs treated with fertiliser or pesticides.</li>
<li>Fair Trade: Over 100 <a href="fair_trade" title="wikilink">fair trade</a> products.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> - All bananas sold at Sainsbury's are now <a href="fair_trade" title="wikilink">fair trade</a>.

<h3 id="labelling-produce">Labelling produce</h3>

<h2 id="online-service">Online service</h2>
<p>Sainsbury's operates an internet shopping service branded as &quot;Sainsbury's Online&quot;. To use this service customers choose their grocery items online. Pickers then collect the required items which are delivered to customers from a local store by van. This is available to about 75% of the UK population. The service is run from larger stores which carry the full product range - over 100 stores operate an Online service.</p>
<p>It was previously called 'Sainsbury's to You' and 'Sainsbury's entertain You', and prior to that it was called 'Sainsbury's Orderline'.</p>
<p>Prior to September 2007, and in common with other UK supermarkets with an online shopping and delivery service such as Tesco or Ocado, Sainsbury's Online delivery staff would carry items direct to customers' kitchens. However, from September 2007, delivery staff were instructed to hand over goods at the front door and to not enter customers' houses. According to a Sainsbury's spokesperson this is due to Sainsbury's no longer having insurance which covers their staff when entering people's homes.</p>
<h2 id="sainsburys-bank">Sainsbury's Bank</h2>

<p>In 1997 Sainsbury's Bank was established - a joint venture between J Sainsbury plc and the <a href="Bank_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Bank of Scotland</a>, now part of the <a href="Lloyds_Banking_Group" title="wikilink">Lloyds Banking Group</a>.

<p>Sainsbury's also has a depot called Buntingford. This depot is usually not in operation; however Sainsbury's still own the site and continue to use the depot at busy times, particularly at <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> when Waltham Point gets very busy. Buntingford is ready for use as an emergency depot for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Originally Sainsbury's ran its own distribution network. However after an industrial dispute with their drivers in the 1970s, and with the intention of streamlining and consolidation, much of the distribution is now contracted out - to distribution specialists such as TDG, DHL/Exel Distribution and NFT.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's drivers are employed on flexi-contracts. The staff split is 20% Agency Staff and 80% Sainsbury's staff.</p>
