<p><img src="Daniel_faulkner.jpg" title="fig:Daniel Faulkner" alt="Daniel Faulkner" /> On <a href="December_9" title="wikilink">December 9</a>, <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a>, <a href="Philadelphia_Police_Department" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Police Department</a> officer <a href="Daniel_Faulkner" title="wikilink">Daniel Faulkner</a> was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop of a vehicle driven by <a href="William_Cook_(street_vendor)" title="wikilink">William Cook</a>, Abu-Jamal's younger brother. In the altercation Abu-Jamal was wounded by a shot from Faulkner, and collapsed on the sidewalk. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to <a href="Thomas_Jefferson_University_Hospital" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson University Hospital</a> and received treatment for his injuries. He was later charged with the <a href="first-degree_murder" title="wikilink">first-degree murder</a> of Daniel Faulkner.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The case went to trial in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge <a href="Albert_F._Sabo" title="wikilink">Albert F. Sabo</a> initially agreed to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with criminal defense attorney Anthony Jackson acting as his legal advisor. During the first day of the trial this decision was reversed and Jackson was ordered to resume acting as Abu-Jamal's sole advocate by reason of what the judge deemed to be intentionally disruptive actions on Abu-Jamal's part.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="prosecution-case-at-trial">Prosecution case at trial</h3>
<p>The prosecution presented four witnesses to the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Cynthia White, a prostitute, claimed to see a man emerge from a nearby parking lot and shoot Faulkner.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Michael Scanlon, a motorist, testified that he saw a man run across the street from a parking lot and shoot Faulkner.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the actual killing, testified to witnessing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. At the point of seeing Abu-Jamal start to cross the street toward them from the parking lot, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The prosecution also presented two witnesses who were present at the hospital after the altercation. Hospital security guard Priscilla Durham and Police Officer Garry Bell testified that Abu-Jamal confessed in the hospital by saying, &quot;I shot the mother fucker, and I hope the mother fucker dies.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href=".38_Special" title="wikilink">.38 caliber</a> revolver, belonging to Abu-Jamal, with five spent cartridges was retrieved at the scene. The shell casings and rifling characteristics of the weapon were consistent with bullet fragments taken from Faulkner's body.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Tests to confirm Abu-Jamal had handled and fired the weapon were not performed; Abu-Jamal's struggle with the police during his arrest would have made the potential results scientifically unreliable.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="defense-case-at-trial">Defense case at trial</h3>
<p>The defense maintained that Abu-Jamal was innocent of the charges and that the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses was unreliable.</p>
<p>The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet <a href="Sonia_Sanchez" title="wikilink">Sonia Sanchez</a> who testified that Abu-Jamal was &quot;viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, testified that he saw a man running along the street shortly after the shooting.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This became known as the &quot;running man theory&quot;, based on the possibility that a &quot;running man&quot; may have been the actual shooter. Veronica Jones also testified for the defense but she did not see anyone running.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Other potential defense witnesses refused to appear in court.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-and-sentence">Verdict and sentence</h3>
<p>The jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after three hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>In the sentencing phase of the trial, Abu-Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement. He was then sworn-in and cross-examined about issues relevant to the assessment of his character by Joseph McGill, the prosecuting attorney.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In his statement Abu-Jamal criticized his attorney as a &quot;legal trained lawyer&quot; who was imposed on him against his will and who &quot;knew he was inadequate to the task and chose to follow the directions of this black-robed conspirator, [Judge] Albert Sabo, even if it meant ignoring my directions&quot;. He claimed that his rights had been &quot;deceitfully stolen&quot; from him by the judge, particularly focusing on the denial of his request to receive <a href="McKenzie_friend" title="wikilink">McKenzie friend</a> assistance from <a href="John_Africa" title="wikilink">John Africa</a> and being prevented from proceeding <em><a href="pro_se" title="wikilink">pro se</a></em>. He quoted remarks of John Africa and declared himself &quot;innocent of these charges&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Abu-Jamal was subsequently sentenced to death by the unanimous decision of the jury.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="post-trial-developments">Post-trial developments</h3>
<p>Since the sentence, new information which contradicts the trial evidence has surfaced.</p>
<p>In 1999, <a href="Arnold_Beverly" title="wikilink">Arnold Beverly</a> claimed that, &quot;wearing a green (camouflage) army jacket&quot;, he had run across the street and shot Daniel Faulkner as part of a contract killing because Faulkner was interfering with graft and payoff to corrupt police.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Private investigator George Newman claimed in 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Cynthia White died in 1992,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> before being able to respond to claims that she falsified her testimony.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Kenneth Pate, a step-brother of Priscilla Durham who was imprisoned with Abu-Jamal on other charges, has since claimed that Durham admitted to not hearing the hospital confession.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The hospital doctors have claimed that Abu-Jamal was not capable of making such a dramatic bedside confession at that time.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>In his version of events, detailed in a sworn statement almost 20 years afterwards, Abu-Jamal claimed that he was sitting in his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, then heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. The statement includes no mention of the gun that was found nearby him at the crimescene nor the corresponding firearms shoulder holster he was found to be wearing at the time of his arrest.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> William Cook did not testify or make any statement until 2001 when he claimed that he had not seen who had shot Faulkner.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

Abu-Jamal's counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial because the jury was both racially-biased and misinformed, and the judge was a racist.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> (Court stenographer Terri Maurer-Carter stated in a 2001 affidavit that the presiding judge had exclaimed, &quot;Yeah, and I'm going to help them fry the nigger&quot;, in the course of a conversation regarding Abu-Jamal's case.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Judge Sabo denied making such a comment.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a>) As of February 2008, the court has not rendered a decision.</p>
