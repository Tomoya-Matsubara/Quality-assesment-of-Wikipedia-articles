<p>The <strong>Paramount Television Network</strong> (<strong>PTN</strong>) was a venture by American film corporation <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> to organize a <a href="television_network" title="wikilink">television network</a> in the late 1940s. The company had built television stations <a href="KTLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">KTLA</a> in Los Angeles and <a href="WBBM-TV" title="wikilink">WBKB</a> in Chicago; it also had invested <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>400,000 in the <a href="DuMont_Television_Network" title="wikilink">DuMont Television Network</a>, which operated stations <a href="WNYW" title="wikilink">WABD</a>, <a href="WTTG" class="uri" title="wikilink">WTTG</a>, and <a href="KDKA-TV" title="wikilink">WDTV</a> in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. Escalating disputes between Paramount and DuMont concerning breaches of contract, company control, and network competition erupted regularly between 1940 and 1956, and culminated in the dismantling of the DuMont Network. Television historian Timothy White called the clash between the two companies &quot;one of the most unfortunate and dramatic episodes in the early history of the television industry.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, including the <a href="Emmy_award" title="wikilink">Emmy award</a>-winning children's series <em><a href="Time_For_Beany" title="wikilink">Time For Beany</a></em>. Filmed in <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>, the programs were distributed to an ad-hoc network of stations across the United States. The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), which had filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up on the idea of a television network, but continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast network field when the company launched the <a href="United_Paramount_Network" title="wikilink">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN), a television network which operated until 2006. Paramount's television division is now owned by <a href="CBS_Television_Studios" title="wikilink">CBS Television Studios</a>.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p><a href="William_Wadsworth_Hodkinson" title="wikilink">William Wadsworth Hodkinson</a> founded American film corporation <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> in 1914. <a href="Famous_Players-Lasky_Corporation" title="wikilink">Famous Players-Lasky Corporation</a> acquired the company in 1916 and by the 1920s Paramount had become a key player in <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>. The company founded or acquired many film production and exhibition properties; among these were the 2,000-screen theater chain <a href="United_Paramount_Theatres" title="wikilink">United Paramount Theatres</a> (UPT), newsreel service <a href="Paramount_News" title="wikilink">Paramount News</a>, and animation studio <a href="Famous_Studios" title="wikilink">Famous Studios</a>. The company became one of the &quot;<a href="Big_Five_(movie_studios)#The_majors_during_the_Golden_Age" title="wikilink">big five</a>&quot; Hollywood studios. By the 1940s, however, Paramount was the target of several anti-trust lawsuits brought against the studio by the federal government, which accused Paramount of conducting monopolistic practices. The <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) forced Paramount to sell off its theater division in 1949.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>As early as 1937, executives at Paramount Pictures were interested in the <a href="History_of_television#United_States" title="wikilink">new medium of television</a>. The following year, Paramount purchased a minority interest in <a href="DuMont_Laboratories" title="wikilink">DuMont Laboratories</a>, a pioneer in early television technology founded by Dr. <a href="Allen_B._DuMont" title="wikilink">Allen B. DuMont</a>. Relations between Paramount and DuMont staff were strained by 1940, when Paramount, without DuMont, opened Chicago television station <a href="WBBM-TV" title="wikilink">WBKB</a> and Los Angeles station <a href="KTLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">KTLA</a>. Dr. DuMont claimed that the original 1937 acquisition proposal required that Paramount would expand its television interests &quot;through DuMont&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Paramount representative Paul Raibourn denied that any such restriction had ever been discussed (a 1953 examination of the original draft document vindicated DuMont on this point).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The stock in DuMont, coupled with the Chicago and Los Angeles stations, gave Paramount full or partial ownership of four of the first nine television stations in the United States.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>DuMont Laboratories launched the <a href="DuMont_Television_Network" title="wikilink">DuMont Television Network</a> in 1946. Despite Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont, Paramount's two stations never aired television programs from DuMont's television network (with the exception of one year on KTLA in 1947&lt;U+2013&gt;48), and competed against DuMont's affiliates in Los Angeles and Chicago.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> According to authors Auter and Boyd, Paramount's construction of KTLA and WBKB and its subsequent launch of the Paramount Television Network &quot;undercut&quot; DuMont, a company it had invested in.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>KTLA began commercial broadcasts in January 1947; its first evening broadcast was hosted by <a href="Bob_Hope" title="wikilink">Bob Hope</a> and featured <a href="Kirk_Douglas" title="wikilink">Kirk Douglas</a>, <a href="William_Bendix" title="wikilink">William Bendix</a>, <a href="Dorothy_Lamour" title="wikilink">Dorothy Lamour</a>, <a href="William_Demarest" title="wikilink">William Demarest</a>, <a href="Ray_Milland" title="wikilink">Ray Milland</a>, and <a href="Cecil_B._DeMille" title="wikilink">Cecil B. DeMille</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> KTLA was the first commercial station west of the Mississippi River. Although other Los Angeles TV stations operated experimentally and received commercial licenses, KTLA had a head start that resulted in a large viewership; a 1949 audience estimate from the <a href="Hooper_Ratings" title="wikilink">C.E. Hooper company</a> indicated that KTLA was broadcasting 28 of the top 30 television series in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The popularity of KTLA's local programs opened up the possibility that they would become national hits if released to other stations across the country.</p>
<h2 id="launch">Launch</h2>
<p>Paramount's television division, Television Productions, Inc., created the Paramount Television Network in 1948.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Full-page advertisements announcing the newly created network ran in <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> that year and in <em>Television</em> magazine early the following year.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Filming of programs took place at KTLA. A <a href="coaxial_cable" title="wikilink">coaxial cable</a> link between KTLA and <a href="KFMB-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">KFMB-TV</a> in San Diego transmitted a live signal to San Diego viewers.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Other television stations across the United States received Paramount programs via <a href="kinescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">kinescope</a> recording for airing; these filmed series allowed stations to &quot;fill in&quot; their schedules during hours when <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>, <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>, <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>, and DuMont were not broadcasting shows, or when station managers preferred Paramount's filmed offerings to those of the four networks. Station managers at WBKB-TV in Chicago also had plans to distribute their own kinescoped programs.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Paramount management planned to acquire additional <a href="owned-and-operated_station" title="wikilink">owned-and-operated stations</a> (&quot;O&amp;Os&quot;); the company applied to the FCC for additional stations in San Francisco, Detroit, and Boston.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The FCC, however, denied Paramount's applications. A few years earlier, the federal regulator had placed a five-station cap on all television networks: no network was allowed to own more than five <a href="VHF" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHF</a> television stations. Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate, the FCC ruled that Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company. Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two, the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations. The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont, but Paramount refused.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> According to television historian William Boddy, &quot;Paramount's checkered anti-trust history&quot; helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Both television networks suffered as a result, with neither company able to acquire five O&amp;Os. Meanwhile, CBS, ABC, and NBC had each acquired the maximum of five stations by the mid-1950s.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Author Timothy White has called Paramount's efforts to launch its own television service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision&lt;U+2014&gt;Paramount in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, and the lack of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont was gone.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

This appointment created another point of conflict between Paramount and DuMont. According to <a href="Leonard_Goldenson" title="wikilink">Leonard Goldenson</a>, president of ABC during this era, Raibourn &quot;constantly nitpicked and needled [Allen DuMont] over the smallest expenditures.

<p>During the 1940s and '50s, television networks in the United States were restricted to owning no more than five local <a href="VHF" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHF</a> TV stations.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> This system, which had evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in TV network executives forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Most Paramount stations were in the United States, but at least two were Canadian stations.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>During this era, American television programs were either broadcast live to local television stations via <a href="microwave_relay" title="wikilink">microwave relay</a> and <a href="AT&amp;T" class="uri" title="wikilink">AT&amp;T</a>'s coaxial cable service or were recorded on kinescope and delivered through the mail to local stations. The live broadcast method was expensive, but was preferred by executives at each of the four major U.S. television networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, and DuMont); in 1954, DuMont alone spent $3 million on live TV broadcasts.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The major networks sent kinescopes to stations when live transmissions were not possible. &quot;Film networks&quot;, which sent out only prerecorded material, also existed; kinescopes were cheap to produce and cost little to mail. Paramount's television service was a hybrid of the two systems, with a live connection between KTLA and KFMB-TV in San Diego,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and other affiliates broadcasting programs from kinescope recordings.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Paramount executives considered a live connection between Los Angeles and San Francisco too expensive. Uniquely, Paramount's <em>The Harry Owens Show</em> was broadcast live in Los Angeles and San Francisco by having the program's performers and crew commute via airplane between the two stations for sequential performances.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>The table below lists stations which carried Paramount Television Network programs, including the company's two owned-and-operated stations, KTLA and WBKB. DuMont's three VHF stations, WABD, WTTG, and WDTV, which aired little or no Paramount programming but which the FCC ruled were O&amp;Os of the same entity, also appear in this list. Also included are DuMont's two short-lived <a href="UHF" class="uri" title="wikilink">UHF</a> licenses: KCTY-TV, which only operated for a few months,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> and WHK-TV, which never signed on.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> A number of stations carried <em>Armchair Detective</em>, <em>Sandy Dreams</em>, and <em>Frosty Frolics</em> when those programs aired on CBS and ABC.

<p>In May 1951, ABC chairman <a href="Edward_Noble" title="wikilink">Edward Noble</a> and United Paramount Theatres president Leonard Goldenson announced a proposed merger between their companies. The plan was to merge ABC and its five television stations with United Paramount Theatres, a company only recently spun off from Paramount Pictures. UPT also owned the Chicago station, WBKB; that station would have to be sold in order for the merged company to stay under the five-station cap. Because the proposed merger involved the sale of a television station, it required the approval of the FCC, which opened a hearing on the issue that August. The proposed deal was complex, and would affect many parties involved in television broadcasting, including Paramount, DuMont, and CBS (CBS executives wanted to purchase WBKB). During the hearing, Allen DuMont asked the FCC to force Paramount to sell its share of the DuMont Network. He stated that Paramount in effect owned two television networks, the PTN and DuMont; the FCC had similarly forced NBC to sell off one of its two radio networks eight years earlier due to concerns about multi-network ownership. Paramount executives, however, denied ever having operated a television network. Evidence presented against Paramount included network affiliation contracts and advertisements for the Paramount Television Network from 1951.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> Despite Paramount executives' testimony, advertisements for the Paramount Television Network ran as late as 1952.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
<p>After a grueling 18-month trial, the federal agency allowed the ABC-UPT merger, but never ruled on Paramount's partial ownership of a second network; Paramount was allowed to retain its shares in DuMont. Leo Resnick, hearing examiner for the Commission, concluded that Paramount did not control DuMont, but the FCC rejected this portion of Resnick's findings, restricting Paramount and DuMont to a total of five stations. The commissioners had not forgotten Paramount's previous anti-trust violations, and believed Paramount executives were attempting to control television by operating two television networks. According to White, the FCC's ruling &quot;ensured that television broadcasting would be controlled by the same three companies that had dominated radio broadcasting, thus fostering a lack of diversity in both station and network ownership&quot;.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1953 merger of ABC and United Paramount Theatres lead to the divestiture of WBKB (now <a href="WBBM-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WBBM-TV</a>), which was sold to CBS. Paramount retained KTLA and applied to the FCC for a new station in Boston, but the construction permit was never granted.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> By this time, Paramount's television arm was called Paramount TV Productions, Incorporated;<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Paramount ceased using the PTN name. The company continued to distribute programs nationally, however, and continued to sign network affiliation agreements with local television stations.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
<p>With just one owned-and-operated station, Paramount's program service never gelled into a true television network; television historians such as Alex McNeil (1996) consider Paramount programs <a href="broadcast_syndication" title="wikilink">syndicated</a> rather than network series.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> While the Paramount series <em>Hollywood Wrestling</em> and <em>Time For Beany</em> were widely seen on stations across the United States, most other Paramount television programs aired in only a handful of markets (another exception, <em>Hollywood Reel</em>, aired in fourteen major cities in 1950).<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
<p>Paramount's revenues were much smaller than those of a true television network,<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> and gradually Paramount began losing program sponsors<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a> or ended production on formerly-popular television series.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a><a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> American Vitamin Corporation, Paramount's sponsor for both <em>The Spade Cooley Show</em> and <em>Frosty Frolics</em>, pulled its $25,000 weekly sponsorship in October 1951.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> In June 1953 it was announced that <em>Time For Beany</em> and Paramount Television Productions were &quot;calling it a day&quot;.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> Paramount ended production of its flagship series in October 1953; rival Los Angeles station <a href="KTTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">KTTV</a> and independent distributor Consolidated Television took over production and distribution, respectively, of <em>Time For Beany</em>.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> Independent distributor Cinema-Vue took over <em>Hollywood Wrestling</em>.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a> By late 1955, <em>Billboard</em> reported the Paramount Network consisted of just 15 stations airing <em>Bandstand Revue</em>. <em>Billboard</em> called this a &quot;sort of&quot; network.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> Management changes at KTLA, coupled with low local ratings, caused the cancellation of <em>Bandstand Revue</em> in October 1956.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> Klaus Landsberg, who had produced many of the series for KTLA, died in September 1956<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> and the new station manager made what <em>Billboard</em> called &quot;sweeping changes&quot; at the station.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a></p>
<p>By Autumn 1955, Hollywood insiders were predicting that Paramount would launch a major television network using KTLA and the DuMont stations. Articles reported that Paramount was seeking television scripts and was constructing theaters and studios which rivaled those of ABC, CBS, and NBC.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> In a dramatic move, Paramount's board of directors seized control of DuMont Laboratories in a <a href="boardroom_coup" title="wikilink">boardroom coup</a> in August 1955. Paramount executives replaced DuMont's board of directors, Dr. DuMont was removed as president of the company, and DuMont Network operations ceased the following year.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> However, no combined Paramount-DuMont network ever materialized; according to television historian Timothy White, by this time &quot;a television network was no longer among Paramount's plans for exploitation of the small screen&quot;.<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a> Paramount sold its interest in DuMont (by this time renamed &quot;Metropolitan Broadcasting Company&quot;) in 1959;<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a> the sale ended Paramount's first ventures into network television.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite Paramount's failure to build a national broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy with the idea of entering the television medium once more. After acquiring <a href="Desilu_Productions" title="wikilink">Desilu Productions</a> in 1967, the company continued to <a href="Paramount_Television" title="wikilink">produce series</a> seen on the <a href="Big_Three_Television_Networks" title="wikilink">&quot;big three&quot; television networks</a>.
