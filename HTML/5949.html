<p>Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in <a href="Lansing,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Lansing</a>, <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> to Earvin Sr., a <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a> assembly worker, and Christine, a school <a href="janitor" title="wikilink">custodian</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Johnson, who had six siblings,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> was influenced by his parents' strong work ethic. Johnson's mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Earvin Jr. would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him &quot;Garbage Man.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a youngster. His favorite basketball player was <a href="Bill_Russell" title="wikilink">Bill Russell</a>, whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He also idolized players such as <a href="Earl_Monroe" title="wikilink">Earl Monroe</a> and <a href="Marques_Haynes" title="wikilink">Marques Haynes</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and practiced &quot;all day.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Magic Johnson came from an athletic family. His father played high school basketball in his home state of Mississippi,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and Johnson learned the finer points about the game from him. Johnson's mother, originally from <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> had also played basketball as a child, and he grew up watching his brothers play the game.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>By the time he had reached the eighth grade, Johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball. He had become a dominant junior high player, once scoring 48 points in a game.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Johnson looked forward to playing at <a href="J._W._Sexton_High_School" title="wikilink">Sexton High School</a> a school with a very successful basketball team and a great tradition that also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be <a href="Desegregation_busing" title="wikilink">bused</a> to all-white <a href="Everett_High_School_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">Everett High School</a>, instead of going to Sexton, which was all-black.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students, and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg Earvin not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually Johnson accepted his situation, and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> When recalling the events in his autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I look back on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett turned to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson was first dubbed &quot;Magic&quot; as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for <a href="Everett_High_School_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">Everett High School</a>, when he recorded a <a href="triple-double" class="uri" title="wikilink">triple-double</a> of 36 <a href="point_(basketball)" title="wikilink">points</a>, 18 <a href="rebound_(basketball)" title="wikilink">rebounds</a> and 16 assists.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the <em><a href="Lansing_State_Journal" title="wikilink">Lansing State Journal</a></em>, gave him the <a href="moniker" class="uri" title="wikilink">moniker</a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and took his team to an <a href="Overtime_(sports)" title="wikilink">overtime</a> victory in the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">state</a> championship game.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, who was killed in a car accident the previous summer.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> saying years later, &quot;I doubted myself back then.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and was also named to the 1977 <a href="McDonald&#39;s_All-America" title="wikilink">McDonald's All-American</a> team.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as <a href="Indiana_University_(Bloomington)" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> and <a href="University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">UCLA</a>, he decided to play close to home.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> His college decision came down to the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="Michigan_State_University" title="wikilink">Michigan State University</a> in <a href="East_Lansing" title="wikilink">East Lansing</a>. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when its coach <a href="Jud_Heathcote" title="wikilink">Jud Heathcote</a> told him he could play the <a href="point_guard" title="wikilink">point guard</a> position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his <a href="communication_studies" title="wikilink">communication studies</a> <a href="Academic_major" title="wikilink">major</a> and on his desire to become a television commentator.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Playing with future NBA draftees <a href="Greg_Kelser" title="wikilink">Greg Kelser</a>, <a href="Jay_Vincent" title="wikilink">Jay Vincent</a> and <a href="Mike_Brkovich" title="wikilink">Mike Brkovich</a>, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a <a href="First_year" title="wikilink">freshman</a>, and led the <a href="Michigan_State_Spartans" title="wikilink">Spartans</a> to a 25&lt;U+2013&gt;5 record, the <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> title, and a berth in the <a href="1978_NCAA_Men&#39;s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament" title="wikilink">1978 NCAA Tournament</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Spartans reached the <a href="Elite_Eight" title="wikilink">Elite Eight</a>, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion <a href="Kentucky_Wildcats_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>After announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the <a href="Magic_Johnson_Foundation" title="wikilink">Magic Johnson Foundation</a> to help combat HIV,<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> In 1992, he joined the <a href="National_Commission_on_AIDS" title="wikilink">National Commission on AIDS</a>, a committee appointed by members of <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> and the <a href="George_H.W._Bush" title="wikilink">Bush Administration</a>.

<p>HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals,<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to &quot;help educate all people about what [HIV] is about&quot; and teach others not to &quot;discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS&quot;.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a><a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="rivalry-with-larry-bird">Rivalry with Larry Bird</h3>
<p><img src="Magic_Bird_Lipofsky.jpg" title="fig:Johnson battling with Bird for rebounding position in Game 2 of the 1985 NBA Finals at Boston Garden." alt="Johnson battling with Bird for rebounding position in Game 2 of the 1985 NBA Finals at Boston Garden." /> </p>
<p>Johnson and <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a> were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers&lt;U+2013&gt;Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily <a href="box_score" title="wikilink">box score</a> was the first thing he checked in the morning.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<p>Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson&lt;U+2013&gt;Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (&quot;Showtime&quot;) and Boston/Indiana <a href="Blue-collar_worker" title="wikilink">blue collar</a> grit (&quot;Celtic Pride&quot;), and between blacks and whites.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans,<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from <a href="bankruptcy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bankruptcy</a>.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 <a href="Converse_(company)" title="wikilink">Converse</a> shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a><a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a &quot;friend forever&quot;;<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-jerry-buss">Relationship with Jerry Buss</h2>
<p>Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Calling Buss his &quot;second father&quot; and &quot;one of [his] best friends&quot;, Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, &quot;Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic.&quot;<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> Buss acquired the team from <a href="Jack_Kent_Cooke" title="wikilink">Jack Kent Cooke</a> in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the <a href="1979_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1979 NBA Draft</a>. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a><a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a></p>
<p>Buss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach. Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the <a href="1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93 NBA season</a> voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a><a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
