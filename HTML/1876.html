<p><strong>Cape Town</strong> (; ) is the second-most populous city in South Africa,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the largest in land area, forming part of the <a href="City_of_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">City of Cape Town</a> <a href="metropolitan_municipality_(South_Africa)" title="wikilink">metropolitan municipality</a>. It is the provincial capital and <a href="primate_city" title="wikilink">primate city</a> of the <a href="Western_Cape" title="wikilink">Western Cape</a>, as well as the <a href="legislature" title="wikilink">legislative</a> capital of South Africa, where the <a href="Parliament_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">National Parliament</a> and many government offices are located. The city is famous for <a href="Port_of_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">its harbour</a> as well as its natural setting in the <a href="Cape_floral_kingdom" title="wikilink">Cape floral kingdom</a>, including such well-known landmarks as <a href="Table_Mountain" title="wikilink">Table Mountain</a> and <a href="Cape_Point" title="wikilink">Cape Point</a>. Cape Town is also Africa's most popular tourist destination.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Located on the shore of <a href="Table_Bay" title="wikilink">Table Bay</a>, Cape Town was originally developed by the <a href="Dutch_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch East India Company</a> as a victualling (supply) station for Dutch ships sailing to Eastern Africa, India, and the Far East. <a href="Jan_van_Riebeeck" title="wikilink">Jan van Riebeeck</a>'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town quickly outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the <a href="Castle_of_Good_Hope" title="wikilink">Castle of Good Hope</a>, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the <a href="Cape_Colony" title="wikilink">Cape Colony</a>. Until the <a href="Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand Gold Rush</a> and the development of <a href="Johannesburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Johannesburg</a>, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.</p>
<p>Today it is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, reflecting its role as a major destination for immigrants and <a href="expatriates" class="uri" title="wikilink">expatriates</a> to South Africa.  the city had an estimated population of 3.5 million.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Cape Town's land area of  is larger than other South African cities, resulting in a comparatively lower population density of .<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The earliest known remnants in the region were found at Peers cave in <a href="Fish_Hoek" title="wikilink">Fish Hoek</a> and date to between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> <a href="Age_of_Discovery" title="wikilink">explorer</a> <a href="Bartolomeu_Dias" title="wikilink">Bartolomeu Dias</a> in 1486. <a href="Vasco_da_Gama" title="wikilink">Vasco da Gama</a> recorded a sighting of the <a href="Cape_of_Good_Hope" title="wikilink">Cape of Good Hope</a> in 1497. In the late 16th century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English ships regularly stopped over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the <a href="Khoikhoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khoikhoi</a> in exchange for fresh meat. In 1652, <a href="Jan_van_Riebeeck" title="wikilink">Jan van Riebeeck</a> and other employees of the <a href="Dutch_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch East India Company</a> (, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>, and the <a href="Fort_de_Goede_Hoop" title="wikilink">Fort de Goede Hoop</a> (later replaced by the <a href="Castle_of_Good_Hope" title="wikilink">Castle of Good Hope</a>). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>. Many of these became ancestors of the first <a href="Cape_Coloureds" title="wikilink">Cape Coloured</a> communities.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleonic</a> wars, the Netherlands was repeatedly occupied by France, and Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies. Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Netherlands by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the battle of <a href="Bloubergstrand,_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Bloubergstrand</a>. In the <a href="Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1814" title="wikilink">Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814</a>, Cape Town was permanently ceded to Britain. It became the capital of the newly formed <a href="Cape_Colony" title="wikilink">Cape Colony</a>, whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The discovery of diamonds in <a href="Griqualand_West" title="wikilink">Griqualand West</a> in 1867, and the <a href="Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Witwatersrand Gold Rush</a> in 1886, prompted a flood of immigrants to South Africa. Conflicts between the <a href="Boer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boer</a> republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the <a href="Second_Boer_War" title="wikilink">Second Boer War</a> of 1899&lt;U+2013&gt;1902, which Britain won. In 1910, Britain established the <a href="Union_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Union of South Africa</a>, which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British <a href="colony_of_Natal" title="wikilink">colony of Natal</a>. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the <a href="Republic_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Republic of South Africa</a>.</p>

This led to the <a href="Group_Areas_Act" title="wikilink">Group Areas Act</a>, which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was <a href="District_Six,_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">District Six</a>. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Many of these residents were relocated to the <a href="Cape_Flats" title="wikilink">Cape Flats</a> and Lavender Hill. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a &quot;<a href="Coloured" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coloured</a> labour preference area&quot;, to the exclusion of &quot;<a href="Bantu-speaking_peoples_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">Bantus</a>&quot;, i.e. blacks.</p>
<p>Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. On <a href="Robben_Island" title="wikilink">Robben Island</a>, a former penitentiary island 10-kilometres from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, <a href="Nelson_Mandela" title="wikilink">Nelson Mandela</a> made his first public speech in decades on 11 February 1990 from the balcony of <a href="Cape_Town_City_Hall" title="wikilink">Cape Town City Hall</a> hours after being released. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first <a href="South_African_general_election,_1994" title="wikilink">democratic election</a> was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the <a href="Victoria_&amp;_Alfred_Waterfront" title="wikilink">Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront</a> features statues of South Africa's four <a href="Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel Peace Prize</a> winners &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Albert_Luthuli" title="wikilink">Albert Luthuli</a>, <a href="Desmond_Tutu" title="wikilink">Desmond Tutu</a>, <a href="F._W._de_Klerk" title="wikilink">F.

Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as HIV/AIDS, <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, a surge in violent <a href="drug-related_crime" title="wikilink">drug-related crime</a> and more recent xenophobic violence. At the same time, the economy has surged to unprecedented levels due to the boom in the tourism and the real estate industries.</p>

Sometimes a thin strip of cloud forms over the mountain, and owing to its appearance, it is colloquially known as the &quot;tablecloth&quot;. The peninsula consists of a dramatic mountainous spine jutting southwards into the Atlantic Ocean, ending at <a href="Cape_Point" title="wikilink">Cape Point</a>. There are over 70 peaks above  (the American definition of a mountain) within Cape Town's official city limits. Many of the suburbs of Cape Town are on the large plain of the <a href="Cape_Flats" title="wikilink">Cape Flats</a>, which joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Flats lie on what is known as a rising marine plain, consisting mostly of sandy geology which shows that at one point Table Mountain itself was an island.</p>

In winter time, which lasts from the beginning of June to end of August, large cold fronts come across from the Atlantic Ocean with heavy <a href="precipitation_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">precipitation</a> and strong north-westerly winds. The winter months are cool, with an average minimum of  and maximum of .<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Most of the city's annual rainfall occurs in wintertime, but due to the mountainous topography of the city, rainfall amounts for specific areas can vary dramatically. <a href="Newlands,_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Newlands</a>, to the south of the city, is the wettest suburb in South Africa.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The valleys and coastal plains average  of rain per annum, while mountain areas can average as much as  per annum.</p>
<p>Summer, which lasts from November to March, is warm and dry. The Peninsula gets frequent strong winds from the south-east, known locally as the <a href="Cape_Doctor" title="wikilink">Cape Doctor</a>, because it blows away pollution and cleans the air. The south-easterly wind is caused by a <a href="Pressure_system#High-pressure_system" title="wikilink">high-pressure system</a> which sits in the <a href="South_Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">South Atlantic</a> to the west of Cape Town, known as the South-Atlantic High. Summer temperatures are mild, with an average maximum of . Cape Town can be uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning &quot;mountain wind&quot; blows from the <a href="Karoo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karoo</a> interior for a couple of weeks in February or early March.</p>
<p>Water temperatures range greatly, between  on the Atlantic Seaboard, to  in False Bay. Average annual Ocean temperatures are between  on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> or <a href="Big_Sur" title="wikilink">Big Sur</a>), and  in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as <a href="Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nice</a> or <a href="Monte_Carlo" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo</a>). </p>

Though the Cape's water ranges from cold to mild, the difference between the two sides of the city is dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual water temperatures barely above that of coastal California around , the False Bay coast is very much warmer, averaging between  annually. This is similar to water temperatures in much of the Northern <a href="Mediterranean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> (for example <a href="Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nice</a>).

<p><img src="UCT_Upper_Campus_landscape_view.jpg" title="fig:The University of Cape Town&#39;s main campus" alt="The University of Cape Town&#39;s main campus" width="250" /> Cape Town has a well-developed higher system of <a href="public_university" title="wikilink">public universities</a>. Cape Town is served by three public universities: the <a href="University_of_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">University of Cape Town</a> (UCT), the <a href="University_of_the_Western_Cape" title="wikilink">University of the Western Cape</a> (UWC) and the <a href="Cape_Peninsula_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Cape Peninsula University of Technology</a> (CPUT). <a href="Stellenbosch_University" title="wikilink">Stellenbosch University</a>, while not in the city itself, is 50-kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park closer to the City.</p>
<p>Both the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector. UCT is an English speaking institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA programme that is ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> It is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Since the <a href="African_National_Congress" title="wikilink">African National Congress</a> has come into governmental power, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has benefitted the University of the Western Cape.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
