<p><strong>Harry Clifton &quot;Curley&quot; Byrd</strong> (February 12, 1889 – October 2, 1970) was an American university administrator, educator, athlete, coach, and politician. Byrd began a long association with the <a href="University_of_Maryland,_College_Park" title="wikilink">University of Maryland</a> as an undergraduate in 1905, and eventually rose to the position of <a href="President_of_the_University_of_Maryland,_College_Park" title="wikilink">university president</a> from 1936 to 1954.</p>
<p>In the interim, he had also served as the university's <a href="athletic_director" title="wikilink">athletic director</a> and head coach for the <a href="Maryland_Terrapins_football" title="wikilink">football</a> and <a href="Maryland_Terrapins_baseball" title="wikilink">baseball teams</a>. Byrd amassed a 119–82–15 record in football from 1911 to 1934 and 88–73–4 record in baseball from 1913 to 1923. <a href="Byrd_Stadium" title="wikilink">Byrd Stadium</a>, the university's current football field, and <a href="Old_Byrd_Stadium" title="wikilink">its predecessor</a> were both named in his honor. In graduate school at <a href="Georgetown_University" title="wikilink">Georgetown University</a>, he became one of football's early users of the newly legalized <a href="forward_pass" title="wikilink">forward pass</a>, and he had a brief baseball career including one season as <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> for the <a href="San_Francisco_Seals" title="wikilink">San Francisco Seals</a>.</p>
<p>Byrd resigned as university president in order to enter politics in 1954. He ran an unsuccessful campaign as the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic candidate</a> for <a href="Governor_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">Maryland Governor</a> against <a href="Theodore_McKeldin" title="wikilink">Theodore McKeldin</a>. Byrd later received appointments to state offices with responsibilities in the <a href="Potomac_River" title="wikilink">Potomac River</a> and <a href="Chesapeake_Bay" title="wikilink">Chesapeake Bay</a>. In the 1960s, he made unsuccessful bids for seats in each chamber of the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a>. Byrd was a proponent of a &quot;<a href="separate_but_equal" title="wikilink">separate but equal</a>&quot; status of racial segregation in his roles as both university administrator and political candidate.</p>

<p>Harry Clifton Byrd was born on February 12, 1889, in <a href="Crisfield,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Crisfield, Maryland</a>.

<p>A later source described how he appeared in 1905:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He was tall, and as the saying goes, built like a whip. He had a startlingly handsome face, with big, flashing eyes, a splotch of florid red on each cheek, and a mane of black curly hair ... He looked like <a href="Rupert_of_Hentzau" title="wikilink">Rupert of Hentzau</a>, and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution about everything that he did.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Byrd was a staunch supporter of a &quot;<a href="separate_but_equal" title="wikilink">separate but equal</a>&quot; state university system.

<p>In 1945, Byrd hired 32-year old <a href="Bear_Bryant" title="wikilink">Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant</a> to his first head coaching post.
