<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>A young monster named Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Wazowski dreams of being a scarer (a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children so their screams can be harvested for energy) when he grows up, after visiting Monsters Inc.Monstropolis' most profitable and best-known scaring companyon a school field trip. Eleven years later, Mike is a scare major at Monsters University, where he meets his new roommate, Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Boggs, and a large, blue, furry monster named James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Mike studies hard, while the privileged Sulleywho comes from a talented family of scarersrelies on his natural scaring ability and begins to falter. At the final exam, Mike and Sulley's rivalry makes Dean Hardscrabble fail them both and drop them from the program, prompting Roar Omega Roar to remove Sulley from their team. Mike decides to prove himself by entering the Scare Games, but Oozma Kappathe only fraternity that was removed from the programis denied entry as they are one team member short. Seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program, Sulley joins and Mike reluctantly accepts.</p>
<p>Oozma Kappa fails the first challenge, an obstacle course where the contestants dodge harmful, glowing &quot;urchins,&quot; but miraculously advances when another team is disqualified for using protection gel, which violates the Scare Games' rules. The contestants attend Roar Omega Roar's party where the other competitors humiliate and discourage Oozma Kappa. Mike arranges a secret visit to Monsters, Inc. to lift their spirits, but Sulley still doubts that Mike can be a true scarer. Oozma Kappa places second in the following events. In the final round, they pull off a close victory cemented by a final decisive scare by Mike. Afterwards, Mike discovers that Sulley cheated to improve Mike's score. Determined to prove he is capable of becoming a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world, but the door leads to a summer camp and he is unable to scare a cabin full of children.</p>
<p>Back at the university, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is notified of the break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley enters the door to look for Mike. After finding and reconciling with him, they try to return but they find they are trapped in the human world because Hardscrabble has deactivated the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Mike realizes that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the adults, generating an overwhelming amount of scream energy and allowing them to return to the lab.</p>
<p>Their actions lead to their expulsion from the university, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester because Hardscrabble is impressed with their performance in the games. They share goodbyes and as Sulley and Mike leave, Hardscrabble tells them they are the first to have surprised her and wishes them luck for the future. Mike and Sulley begin work at Monsters, Inc. in the company mailroom under the mailroom manager, the <a href="Yeti" title="wikilink">Abominable Snowman</a>. Working their way up through the company, the two eventually become part of the Scarer Team, thus setting the events of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> in motion.</p>

<p>The plot of <em>Monsters University</em> details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, but this created a continuity error from the <a href="Monsters,_Inc." title="wikilink">first film</a> in which Mike tells Sulley that he has been jealous of his looks since the fourth grade. Director <a href="Dan_Scanlon" title="wikilink">Dan Scanlon</a> said he had a dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, &quot;we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are.&quot; He added, &quot;It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make <em>Monsters Elementary.</em>&quot; Scanlon said during pre-production that, &quot;<a href="Pete_Docter" title="wikilink">Pete Docter</a>, the original director, and <a href="John_Lasseter" title="wikilink">John Lasseter</a> ... finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honouring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside.&quot; Scanlon also said the line from the first film is, &quot;an old monster expression&quot; and &quot;That's what monsters always say to each other.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Monsters University</em> is the first Pixar film that used <a href="global_illumination" title="wikilink">global illumination</a>, a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> film. In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked &quot;What if we made these lights just work?&quot; Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses <a href="Ray_tracing_(graphics)" title="wikilink">ray tracing</a>, a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenessome of which contained thousands of light sources.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

For a mere prequel, that's a result.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Chris Nashawaty of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> gave the film an A&lt;U+2212&gt;, and said it &quot;is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's <em><a href="Cars_2" title="wikilink">Cars 2</a></em> left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Steven Rea of <em><a href="The_Philadelphia_Inquirer" title="wikilink">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, and said it &quot;is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Jake Coyle of the <em><a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, saying it &quot;might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be OK.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter Travers of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, and said, &quot;It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. In the art of tickling funny bones, Crystal and Goodman earn straight A's.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Richard Corliss of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet. With Pixar, familiarity breeds content.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Bill Goodykoontz of <em><a href="The_Arizona_Republic" title="wikilink">The Arizona Republic</a></em> gave the film three and a half stars out of five and said it is &quot;one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of glad it does.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Alan Scherstuhl of <em><a href="The_Village_Voice" title="wikilink">The Village Voice</a></em> gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;<em>Monsters University</em> feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. It's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Claudia Puig of <em><a href="USA_Today" title="wikilink">USA Today</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, and said it &quot;may not be as inventive as <em>Inc.</em>, but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Michael O'Sullivan of <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, saying, &quot;It may be children&lt;U+2019&gt;s terror that powers the movie&lt;U+2019&gt;s fictional universe, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the energy of its stars that lights up <em>Monsters University</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> <a href="James_Berardinelli" title="wikilink">James Berardinelli</a> of <em><a href="ReelViews" class="uri" title="wikilink">ReelViews</a></em> gave the film three stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The film was not without it detractors, though. Ty Burr of <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said, &quot;This is not a bad movie, and to small children it will be a very good one, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us <em><a href="Up_(2009_film)" title="wikilink">Up</a></em>, <em><a href="WALL-E" class="uri" title="wikilink">WALL-E</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em>, and the <em><a href="Toy_Story_(franchise)" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> series.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Manohla Dargis of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, &quot;Both the originality and stirring emotional complexity of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Stephen Whitty of the <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">Newark Star-Ledger</a></em> gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said, &quot;The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <a href="Richard_Roeper" title="wikilink">Richard Roeper</a> gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying &quot;This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> <a href="Leonard_Maltin" title="wikilink">Leonard Maltin</a> of <em><a href="IndieWire" class="uri" title="wikilink">IndieWire</a></em> praised the animation and art direction, but wrote that he wished &quot;the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy&quot; and that &quot;Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that&lt;U+2019&gt;s merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise.&quot;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Michael Phillips of the <em><a href="Chicago_Tribune" title="wikilink">Chicago Tribune</a></em> gave the film two stars out of four, saying, &quot;<em>Monsters University</em>, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Rene Rodriguez of the <em><a href="Miami_Herald" title="wikilink">Miami Herald</a></em> gave the film two stars out of five, and wrote that it &quot;feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys.&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Todd McCarthy of <em><a href="The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em> gave the film a negative review, saying that it &quot;never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling.&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
