The reason for the movement has been attributed to a reaction to the <a href="Nashville_sound" title="wikilink">Nashville sound</a>, developed by record producers like <a href="Chet_Atkins" title="wikilink">Chet Atkins</a> who softened the raw <a href="honky_tonk" title="wikilink">honky tonk</a> sound that was predominant in the music of performers like <a href="Jimmie_Rodgers_(country_singer)" title="wikilink">Jimmie Rodgers</a>, and his successors such as <a href="Hank_Williams" title="wikilink">Hank Williams</a>, <a href="George_Jones" title="wikilink">George Jones</a> and <a href="Lefty_Frizzell" title="wikilink">Lefty Frizzell</a>. According to <a href="Aaron_Fox" title="wikilink">Aaron Fox</a>, &quot;the fundamental opposition between law-and-order authoritarianism and the image of 'outlaw' authenticity... has structured country's discourse of masculinity since the days of <a href="Jimmie_Rodgers_(country_singer)" title="wikilink">Jimmie Rodgers</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>The roots of the outlaw movement can be traced to the 1950s. A major influence on the outlaw movement was <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a>'s bluesy covers of country standards. However, an even greater transition occurred after <a href="Waylon_Jennings" title="wikilink">Waylon Jennings</a> was able to secure his own recording rights, and began the trend of bucking the &quot;<a href="Nashville_Sound" title="wikilink">Nashville Sound</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="David_Allan_Coe" title="wikilink">David Allan Coe</a> at the time was a patched member of the <a href="Outlaws_Motorcycle_Club" title="wikilink">Outlaws Motorcycle Club</a>, a notorious <a href="Outlaw_motorcycle_club#One_percenter" title="wikilink">one percenter motorcycle club</a>. There were several instances where he was referred to as an outlaw while playing with Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Although Nashville publicly refutes claims that &quot;outlaw country&quot; was a term coined by Coe's involvement in the motorcycle underworld, those who thrive in the biker community both then and now believe that it was Coe who gave the music its title.</p>
<p>The 1960s was a decade of enormous change, and that change was also reflected in the music of the time. <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, the <a href="Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">Rolling Stones</a> and many who followed in their wake cast off the traditional role of the recording artist. They wrote their own material, they had creative input in their albums, and they refused to conform to what society required of its youth. At the same time, country music was declining into a formulaic genre that appeared to offer the establishment what it wanted with artists such as <a href="Porter_Wagoner" title="wikilink">Porter Wagoner</a> and <a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a> making the kind of music that was anathema to the growing counterculture. While <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> continued to be the focus of mainstream country music, cities like <a href="Lubbock,_Texas" title="wikilink">Lubbock</a> and <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin</a> became the creative centers of outlaw country. <a href="Southern_rock" title="wikilink">Southern rock</a> also had a strong influence on the outlaw country movement, and that sound and style of recording was centered in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.</p>
<p>The term &quot;outlaw country&quot; is derived from the song &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot; written by <a href="Lee_Clayton" title="wikilink">Lee Clayton</a> and sung by Waylon Jennings on the 1972 <a href="Ladies_Love_Outlaws_(Waylon_Jennings_album)" title="wikilink">album of the same name</a>. It became associated with singers who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and had a scruffier look in contrast to the clean cut country singers in <a href="Nudie_suit" title="wikilink">Nudie suits</a> that were pushing the <a href="Nashville_sound" title="wikilink">Nashville sound</a>, with the exception of <a href="Gram_Parsons" title="wikilink">Gram Parsons</a> &amp; The <a href="Flying_Burrito_Brothers" title="wikilink">Flying Burrito Brothers</a>. The success of these singers did much to restore the rawness and life force to country music. The songs were about drinking, drugs, hard working men and <a href="honky_tonk" title="wikilink">honky tonk</a> heroes. The music was more like <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> and there were rarely strings in the background.</p>

<p>Although Jennings and Nelson are regarded as the stereotypical outlaws, there were several other writers and performers who provided the material that infused the movement with the outlaw spirit. Some people have noted that Jennings and Nelson were Nashville veterans whose careers were revived by the movement and that they drew on the energy that was being generated in their home state of Texas to spearhead the attack on the Nashville producers. Jennings, in particular, forced his record company to let him produce his own albums. In 1973 he produced <em><a href="Lonesome,_On&#39;ry_and_Mean" title="wikilink">Lonesome, On'ry and Mean</a></em>. The theme song was written by <a href="Steve_Young_(musician)" title="wikilink">Steve Young</a>, a songwriter and performer who never made it in the mainstream, but whose songs helped to create the outlaw style. The follow-up album for Jennings was <em><a href="Honky_Tonk_Heroes" title="wikilink">Honky Tonk Heroes</a></em> and the songwriting hero was Texan <a href="Billy_Joe_Shaver" title="wikilink">Billy Joe Shaver</a>. Like Steve Young, Shaver never made it big, but his 1973 album <em>Old Five and Dimers Like Me</em> is considered a country classic in the outlaw genre.</p>
<p>Willie Nelson's career as a songwriter in Nashville peaked in the late 1960s. His &quot;<a href="Crazy_(Willie_Nelson_song)" title="wikilink">Crazy</a>&quot; was a massive hit for <a href="Patsy_Cline" title="wikilink">Patsy Cline</a>, but as a singer, he was getting nowhere. He left Nashville in 1971 to return to Texas. The musicians he met in Austin had been developing the folk and rock influenced country music that grew into the outlaw genre. Performing and associating with the likes of <a href="Jerry_Jeff_Walker" title="wikilink">Jerry Jeff Walker</a>, <a href="Michael_Martin_Murphey" title="wikilink">Michael Martin Murphey</a> and Billy Joe Shaver helped shape his future career. At the same time as Nelson was reinventing himself, other significant influencers were writing and playing in Austin and Lubbock. <a href="Butch_Hancock" title="wikilink">Butch Hancock</a>, <a href="Joe_Ely" title="wikilink">Joe Ely</a> and <a href="Jimmie_Dale_Gilmore" title="wikilink">Jimmie Dale Gilmore</a> formed <a href="The_Flatlanders" title="wikilink">The Flatlanders</a>, a group that never sold huge numbers of albums, but continues to perform. The three founders have each made a significant contribution to the development of the outlaw genre. <a href="Lost_Gonzo_Band" title="wikilink">The Lost Gonzo Band</a> and their work in conjunction with Jerry Jeff Walker and Michael Murphey were integral in the birth of Outlaw Country. <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=improbable+rise+of+redneck+rock+gonzo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jQsUOpU_z9&amp;sig=1-P6rtLaWWGQFLglb1ftNJ3Dk2I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SGupS6jHCJGtrAe354ztAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gonzo&amp;f=false">1</a></p>
<p>Other Texans, like <a href="Townes_Van_Zandt" title="wikilink">Townes Van Zandt</a>, <a href="Steve_Earle" title="wikilink">Steve Earle</a> and <a href="Guy_Clark" title="wikilink">Guy Clark</a>, have developed the outlaw <a href="ethos" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethos</a> through their songs and their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Although <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a> spent most of his time in Arkansas and Tennessee, he experienced a revival of his career with the outlaw movement, especially after his live albums <em><a href="At_Folsom_Prison" title="wikilink">At Folsom Prison</a></em> and <em><a href="At_San_Quentin" title="wikilink">At San Quentin</a></em>, both of which were recorded in prisons. Cash had working relationships with Nelson, Jennings and <a href="Kris_Kristofferson" title="wikilink">Kris Kristofferson</a> in his later career. He had also been on good terms with several folk counterculture figures, a fact that irked Nashville and television executives (Cash hosted <a href="The_Johnny_Cash_Show" title="wikilink">a variety show</a> from 1969 to 1971). Like the other outlaw singers, he eschewed the polished Nashville look with a somewhat ragged (especially in later years), all-black outfit that inspired Cash's nickname, the &quot;Man in Black.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="Jessi_Colter-I&#39;m_Not_Lisa.jpg" title="fig:Cover of Jessi Colter&#39;s 1975 album I&#39;m Jessi Colter." alt="Cover of Jessi Colter&#39;s 1975 album I&#39;m Jessi Colter." /> Although Outlaw country was mainly the domain of men, there were some women that pursued musical careers in <a href="Country_Music" title="wikilink">Country Music</a> that considered themselves &quot;Outlaws&quot; as well. There are really only four women that became major outlaw stars in country music: [citation needed], <a href="Tanya_Tucker" title="wikilink">Tanya Tucker</a>, <a href="Jessi_Colter" title="wikilink">Jessi Colter</a>, <a href="Sammi_Smith" title="wikilink">Sammi Smith</a>, and <a href="Emmylou_Harris" title="wikilink">Emmylou Harris</a>.</p>
<p>Jessi Colter was the wife of the Outlaw pioneer <a href="Waylon_Jennings" title="wikilink">Waylon Jennings</a>. She married Jennings in 1968. In the mid-70s, she pursued a solo career, and immediately achieved Outlaw status after she scored a #1 country hit, that also reached #4 on the pop charts, titled &quot;<a href="I&#39;m_Not_Lisa" title="wikilink">I'm Not Lisa</a>&quot;, which was penned by Colter herself. Her 1975 album <em><a href="I&#39;m_Jessi_Colter" title="wikilink">I'm Jessi Colter</a></em> showed more of Colter's Outlaw side showing Colter in a <a href="bar_(establishment)" title="wikilink">saloon</a>-like setting, resting her arm on a piano. Colter officially gained full-on Outlaw status when she was featured on the compilation album, along with her husband, called <em><a href="Wanted!_The_Outlaws" title="wikilink">Wanted! The Outlaws</a></em>. The album was a huge commercial and critical success and won many awards.</p>
<p>Another woman who achieved the Outlaw success of her male counterparts was <a href="Sammi_Smith" title="wikilink">Sammi Smith</a>, a singer from <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. Smith was unafraid to sing songs that were considered too &quot;risky&quot; or spoke of the realities of the modern life. Her voice was <a href="wikt:husky#English" title="wikilink">husky</a> from singing in smoky bars before she achieved fame. Smith made it big in 1971, when she recorded <a href="Kris_Kristofferson" title="wikilink">Kris Kristofferson</a>'s song &quot;<a href="Help_Me_Make_It_Through_the_Night" title="wikilink">Help Me Make It Through the Night</a>.&quot; The song brought Smith to the #1 spot on the country charts, and even made her a crossover star, at #8 on the pop charts. The song won her a <a href="Grammy_award" title="wikilink">Grammy award</a> in 1972 for <a href="Best_Female_Country_Vocal_Performance" title="wikilink">Best Female Country Vocal Performance</a>. She officially became an Outlaw when she moved down to <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> and became fast friends with <a href="Willie_Nelson" title="wikilink">Willie Nelson</a>. She regularly attended his <a href="Willie_Nelson&#39;s_Fourth_of_July_Picnic" title="wikilink">Fourth of July picnics</a> every year.</p>
<p>In contemporary country music the one big artist who is often considered an &quot;outlaw&quot; is <a href="Miranda_Lambert" title="wikilink">Miranda Lambert</a>, specifically in her side project <a href="Pistol_Annies" title="wikilink">Pistol Annies</a> with <a href="Ashley_Monroe" title="wikilink">Ashley Monroe</a> and <a href="Angaleena_Presley" title="wikilink">Angaleena Presley</a>.
