Co-directed by <a href="Lee_Unkrich" title="wikilink">Lee Unkrich</a> and <a href="Ash_Brannon" title="wikilink">Ash Brannon</a>, it is the sequel to the 1995 film <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em>. In the film, <a href="Sheriff_Woody" title="wikilink">Woody</a> is stolen by a toy collector, prompting <a href="Buzz_Lightyear" title="wikilink">Buzz Lightyear</a> and his friends vowing to rescue him. However, Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting. Many of the original characters and voices from <em>Toy Story</em> returned and several new characters, including <a href="Jessie_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Jessie</a> (<a href="Joan_Cusack" title="wikilink">Joan Cusack</a>), <a href="Barbie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbie</a> (<a href="Jodi_Benson" title="wikilink">Jodi Benson</a>), and Mrs. Potato Head (<a href="Estelle_Harris" title="wikilink">Estelle Harris</a>), were introduced.</p>
<p>Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel. <em>Toy Story 2</em> began production in a building separated from Pixar, in a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on <em><a href="A_Bug&#39;s_Life" title="wikilink">A Bug's Life</a></em> (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team re-developed the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for <em>Toy Story 2</em> was compressed into nine months.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite production struggles, <em>Toy Story 2</em> opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $485 million, and highly positive critical reviews. <em>Toy Story 2</em> has been considered by critics and audiences alike to be one of few sequels that outshine the original,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. The film's success led to the production of <em><a href="Toy_Story_3" title="wikilink">Toy Story 3</a></em> in 2010, which was also highly successful.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>A few years after the events in <em>Toy Story</em>, <a href="Sheriff_Woody" title="wikilink">Woody</a> prepares to go to a camp with <a href="Andy_Davis_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Andy</a>, but his right arm is accidentally ripped. Andy decides to leave him behind, and his mother puts him on a shelf. The next day, Woody discovers <a href="Wheezy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wheezy</a>, a penguin toy, has been shelved for months because of a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a <a href="garage_sale" title="wikilink">yard sale</a>, Woody rescues him, but is stolen by a toy collector. <a href="Buzz_Lightyear" title="wikilink">Buzz Lightyear</a> and the other toys recognize the thief from a commercial as <a href="Al_McWhiggin" title="wikilink">Al McWhiggin</a>, the greedy owner of a toy shop called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, <a href="Hamm_the_toy" title="wikilink">Hamm</a>, <a href="Mr._Potato_Head_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Mr. Potato Head</a>, <a href="Slinky_Dog" title="wikilink">Slinky Dog</a>, and <a href="Rex_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Rex</a> set out to rescue Woody.</p>
<p>In Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable <a href="collectable" class="uri" title="wikilink">collectable</a> based on a 1950s TV show called <em>Woody's Roundup</em> and is set to be sold to a toy museum in <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>. The other toys from the show&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Jessie_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Jessie</a>, Woody's horse <a href="Bullseye_(Toy_Story)" title="wikilink">Bullseye</a>, and <a href="Stinky_Pete" title="wikilink">Stinky Pete</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;are excited to go, but Woody wants to go home because he is still Andy's toy. Jessie is upset with him as the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it; without him, they will go back into storage. That night, when Woody's whole arm falls off, his attempt to retrieve it and escape is foiled when the TV suddenly turns on. Next morning, Woody's arm is fixed, and he learns that Jessie was once the beloved toy of a child named Emily who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete morosely warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. This convinces Woody to stay, now believing that all toys eventually get discarded by their owners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Buzz and the other toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching the store for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by <a href="List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Utility_Belt_Buzz" title="wikilink">another Buzz Lightyear action figure</a> with a belt, who believes that he is a real space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistaken him as their Buzz, and after discovering Al's plan, they make their way to his apartment. The real Buzz escapes and pursues them. After climbing an <a href="elevator" class="uri" title="wikilink">elevator</a>, the toys found Woody, and the real Buzz rejoins them, proving that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to return home. Buzz reminds Woody of &quot;a toy's true purpose&quot; and warns him that in the museum, he will never be played with by a child again. After seeing a boy play on the TV, Woody changes his mind and asks the Roundup toys to come with him. However, Stinky Pete prevents their escape because he wants to go to Japan, as being unsold for years before Al bought him, embittered him enough to want to last forever in the museum. To ensure this, he prevented Woody from leaving, revealing that he was responsible for sabotaging his escape the previous night and framing Jessie for it.</p>
<p>Al arrives and takes the Roundup toys with him, forcing both Buzz Lightyears and Andy's toys to follow him. Accompanied by <a href="List_of_Toy_Story_characters#Squeeze_Toy_Aliens_/_Little_Green_Men" title="wikilink">three toy Aliens</a>, they steal a truck and follow Al to an <a href="airport" class="uri" title="wikilink">airport</a> where they enter the <a href="baggage_handling_system" title="wikilink">baggage handling system</a> and free Woody. In the process, Stinky Pete rips Woody's right arm again and tries to mutilate him, but is stuffed into a little girl's <a href="Barbie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbie</a> backpack by Andy's toys. They then free Bullseye, but Jessie ends up on the plane for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody boards the plane and frees Jessie, allowing the toys to go home.</p>
<p>Andy returns home from the camp, accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, thinking his mother bought them, and repairs Woody's torn arm. The toys also learn from a commercial that Al's business has suffered due to his failure to sell the Roundup toys. As Jessie and Bullseye delight in having a new owner, Woody tells Buzz that he is not worried about Andy discarding him, because when he does, they will always have each other for company. Meanwhile, Wheezy has also been fixed and ends the film with a <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Sinatra</a> style version of &quot;<a href="You&#39;ve_Got_a_Friend_in_Me" title="wikilink">You've Got a Friend in Me</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Talk of a sequel to <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> began around a month after the film's opening, in December 1995.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A few days after the original film's release, Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Woody doll at an airport. Lasseter described the boy's excitement to show it to his father as touching him deeply. Lasseter then realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, it belonged to others as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of <em>Toy Story 2</em>, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone who loved the characters.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Ed_Catmull" title="wikilink">Ed Catmull</a>, Lasseter, and <a href="Ralph_Guggenheim" title="wikilink">Ralph Guggenheim</a> visited Joe Roth, successor to recently ousted Jeffery Katzenberg as chairman of <a href="Walt_Disney_Studios_(production)" title="wikilink">Walt Disney Studios</a>, shortly afterward. Roth was pleased and embraced the idea.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Disney had recently begun making direct-to-video sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the <em>Toy Story</em> sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's <em><a href="Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)" title="wikilink">Aladdin</a></em> sequel, <em><a href="The_Return_of_Jafar" title="wikilink">The Return of Jafar</a></em>, had returned an estimated hundred million dollars in profits.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Initially, everything regarding the sequel was uncertain at first: whether stars <a href="Tom_Hanks" title="wikilink">Tom Hanks</a> and <a href="Tim_Allen" title="wikilink">Tim Allen</a> would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at <a href="Pixar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pixar</a> or traditionally at <a href="Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios" title="wikilink">Disney</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, but top choices were already immersed in other projects (Andrew Stanton in <em><a href="A_Bug&#39;s_Life" title="wikilink">A Bug's Life</a></em> and Pete Docter in early development work for a film that would eventually become <em><a href="Monsters,_Inc." title="wikilink">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>). Instead, Lasseter turned to Ash Brannon, a young directing animator on <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> whose work he admired. Brannon, a <a href="California_Institute_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">CalArts</a> graduate, joined the <em>Toy Story</em> team in 1993.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation Studios officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<td><p>&quot;The story of <em>Toy Story 2</em> is based a lot on my own experience. I'm a big toy collector and a lot of them are like antiques, or one-of-a-kind toys, or prototypes the toy makers have given me. Well I have five sons, and when they were little and they loved to come to daddy's work, and come in into daddy's office and they just want to touch and play with everything. And I sitting there saying 'Oh no, thats uh, you can't play with that one, oh no play with this one, oh no....' and I found myself just sitting there looking at my self and laughing. Because toys are manufactured, put on this earth, to be played with by a child. That is the core essence of <em>Toy Story</em>. And so I started wondering, what was it like from a toy's point of view to be collected.&quot;</p></td>

<p>Lasseter's intention with a sequel was to respect the original film and create that world again.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The story originated with Lasseter pondering what a toy would find upsetting. Lasseter wondered how a toy would feel if they were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of <em>A Tin Toy Christmas</em>, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector known as Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of <em>Toy Story</em> but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Secondary characters in Woody's set emerged from viewings of 1950s cowboy shows for children, such as <em><a href="Howdy_Doody" title="wikilink">Howdy Doody</a></em> and <em><a href="Hopalong_Cassidy" title="wikilink">Hopalong Cassidy</a></em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The scope for the original <em>Toy Story</em> was very basic and only consisted over two residential homes, whereas <em>Toy Story 2</em> has been described by Unkrich as &quot;all over the map.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>To make the project ready for theaters, Lasseter would need to add twelve minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since it could not be mere padding; it would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, <a href="Joe_Ranft" title="wikilink">Joe Ranft</a>, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted a &quot;story summit,&quot; as he called it - a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days. Back at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of <em>Toy Story 2</em> from beginning to end.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of <em>Toy Story</em>. The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would open <em>Toy Story 2</em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A deleted scene from <em>Toy Story</em>, featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for showing Woody's fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of <em>Toy Story</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="animation">Animation</h3>
<p>As the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on <em>A Bug's Life</em> for a 1998 release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful <a href="CD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-ROM</a> titles the previous year: <em>The Toy Story Animated StoryBook</em> and <em>The Toy Story Activity Center</em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in <em>Toy Story</em> itself. <a href="Steve_Jobs" title="wikilink">Steve Jobs</a> made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the <em>Toy Story 2</em> production team.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the <em>Toy Story 2</em> crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. &quot;We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,&quot; co-producer Karen Jackson said.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from <em>Toy Story</em> but, true to the company's &quot;prevailing culture of perfectionism, [&lt;U+2026&gt;] it reused less of <em>Toy Story</em> than might be expected.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team did, however, freely borrow models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short <em><a href="Geri&#39;s_Game" title="wikilink">Geri's Game</a></em>, who became the Cleaner in <em>Toy Story 2</em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Whilst producing <em>Toy Story</em>, the crew was very careful in creating new locations due to technology at that time. By production on <em>Toy Story 2</em>, technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film's look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Production problems were evident from the beginning. Disney soon became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin, associate producers, moved up to the role of co-producers.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with <em>A Bug's Life</em> until it wrapped in the fall. Once available, he took over directing duties and added Lee Unkrich as co-director. Unkrich, also fresh from supervising editor duties on <em>A Bug's Life</em>, would focus on layout and cinematography while Brannon would be credited as co-director.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1997, Disney executives Roth and Peter Schneider viewed the film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing <em>Toy Story 2</em> in theaters.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for <em>Toy Story 2</em> would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal - but <em>Toy Story 2</em> would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>However, many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Lasseter, upon returning from European promotion of <em>A Bug's Life</em>, watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney, however, disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. However, in order to meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time left, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back. Jobs explained that there was no choice, presumably in reference to the film's licensees and marketing partners, who were getting toys and promotions ready.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Brannon focused on development, story and animation, Lasseter was in charge of art, modeling and lighting, and Unkrich oversaw editorial and layout. Since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other (they wanted to make sure they were all going in the same direction), the boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>As common with Pixar features, the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, <em>Toy Story 2</em>, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> While hard work and long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on <em>Toy Story 2</em> for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and <a href="Repetitive_strain_injury" title="wikilink">repetitive strain injuries</a> for others.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. An employee's self-imposed compulsion to excel, however, often trumped any other constraints, and was especially common to younger employees.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at day care one morning and, in a mental haze, forgotten the baby in the back seat of his car in the parking lot. &quot;Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard,&quot; wrote David Price in his 2008 book <em>The Pixar Touch</em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="re-releases">Re-releases</h3>
<p>In 2009, both <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Toy Story 2</em> were converted to <a href="3D_film" title="wikilink">3D</a> for a two-week limited theatrical re-release,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> which was extended due to its success.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Lasseter commented, &quot;The <em>Toy Story</em> films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With <em>Toy Story 3</em> shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Translating the films into 3D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene, creating left-eye and right-eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth. Unique to computer animation, Lasseter referred to this process as &quot;digital archaeology&quot;. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that impacted the film's emotional storytelling. It took four months to resurrect the old data and get it in working order. Then, adding 3D to each of the films took six months per film.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The double feature was opened in 1,745 theaters on October 2, 2009, and made $12,491,789 in its opening weekend, coming in third place at the box office. The feature(s) closed on November 5, 2009, with a worldwide gross of $32,284,600.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Unlike other countries, the UK and Argentina received the films in 3D as separate releases. <em>Toy Story 2</em> was released January 22, 2010 in the UK, and February 18, 2010 in Argentina.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
