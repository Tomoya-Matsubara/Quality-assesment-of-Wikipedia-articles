<p>Joseph Grimaldi</p>
</center>
<p>]] <strong>Joseph Grimaldi</strong> (18 December 1778Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 31 May 1837) was an English actor, comedian and dancer, who became the most popular English entertainer of the <a href="Regency_era" title="wikilink">Regency era</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of <a href="Harlequinade#Clown" title="wikilink">Clown</a> in the <a href="harlequinade" class="uri" title="wikilink">harlequinade</a> that formed part of British <a href="pantomime" title="wikilink">pantomimes</a>, notably at the <a href="Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane" title="wikilink">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> and the <a href="Sadler&#39;s_Wells" title="wikilink">Sadler's Wells</a> and <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Covent Garden</a> theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as &quot;Joey&quot;, and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns. Grimaldi originated catchphrases such as &quot;Here we are again!&quot;, which continues to feature in modern pantomimes.</p>
<p>Born in London to an entertainer father, Grimaldi began to perform as a small child, making his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780. He became successful at the Sadler's Wells Theatre the following year; his first major role was as Little Clown in the pantomime <em>The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding</em> in 1781, in which he starred alongside his father. After brief schooling, he appeared in various low-budget productions and became a sought-after child performer. He took leading parts in <em>Valentine and Orson</em> (1794) and <em>The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy</em> (1796), the latter of which brought him wider recognition.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 1790s, Grimaldi starred in a pantomime version of <em><a href="Robinson_Crusoe#Stage_and_film" title="wikilink">Robinson Crusoe</a></em>, which confirmed him as a key pantomime performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre for good in 1806. In his new association with the Covent Garden theatre, he appeared at the end of the same year in <em>Harlequin or <a href="Mother_Goose" title="wikilink">Mother Goose</a></em>, which included perhaps his best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi's residencies at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London's leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.</p>
<p>Grimaldi's association with Sadler's Wells came to an end in 1820, chiefly as a result of his deteriorating relationship with the theatre's management. After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical disabilities. In his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic. He outlived both his wife and his actor son, <a href="J._S._Grimaldi" title="wikilink">Joseph Samuel</a>, dying at home in <a href="Islington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islington</a> in 1837, aged 59.</p>

<p>Grimaldi's father was a serial philanderer who had at least ten children with three different women. In 1778, he divided his time between two London addresses occupied by his mistresses, Brooker and Anne Perry.

<p>Sadler's Wells closed for refurbishment at the end of its 1801 season and re-opened on 19 April 1802; Grimaldi returned to take a major role in the Easter pantomime, for which he designed the look of his recurring Clown character &quot;Joey&quot;. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns.

<p><em>Harlequin and the Forty Virgins</em> opened the Easter season at Sadler's Wells and lasted the entire season.

<p>During 1815, the relationship between Grimaldi and Thomas Dibdin became strained. Dibdin, as manager at Sadler's Wells, denied Grimaldi's request for a month's leave to tour the provincial theatres.

<p>In 1815, Grimaldi played Clown in <em>Harlequin and the Sylph of the Oak; or, The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</em> at Covent Garden, followed by the Christmas pantomime <em>Robinson Crusoe; or, The Bold Buccaneer</em>, in which he played Friday to Charles Farley's title character.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Grimaldi conducted a remunerative but gruelling tour to Scotland, Manchester and Liverpool in 1818.

<p>Despite Signor Paulo's success at Sadler's Wells, Richard Hughes's widow Lucy, who was a majority shareholder at the theatre, pleaded with Grimaldi to return.

<p>In 1822, Grimaldi travelled to Cheltenham, in poor health, to fulfil an engagement as Clown by another actor in <em>Harlequin and the Ogress; or, the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood</em>.

The years of extreme physical exertion his clowning had involved had taken a toll on his joints, and he suffered from a respiratory condition that often left him breathless.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> noted in 1813: </p>
<p>Although officially retired, Grimaldi still received half of his former small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty after a number of ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes.

Peake hired Grimaldi to star in <em>Monkey Island</em> alongside JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: &quot;I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day&quot;.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> In 1828, two &quot;farewell&quot; benefit performances were held for him.

<p><img src="Grimaldi_grave.JPG" title="fig:Grimaldi&#39;s grave in St. James Churchyard, Pentonville" alt="Grimaldi&#39;s grave in St. James Churchyard, Pentonville" /> The relationship between Grimaldi and his son first became strained during the early 1820s.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> JS, who had made a career of emulating his father's act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS went out of his way to avoid them.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money.

<p>After appearing in a few Christmas pantomimes and benefits for his father, JS fell into unemployment and was incarcerated in a debtors' prison for a time as a result of his alcoholism.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> In 1832, Grimaldi, Mary and their son moved to <a href="Woolwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolwich</a>,<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> but JS often abused his parents' hospitality by bringing home prostitutes and fighting in the house with his alcoholic friends.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> He moved out later that year and died at his lodgings on 11 December 1832, aged 30.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> With Grimaldi almost crippled, and Mary having suffered a stroke days before JS's death, they made a suicide pact.

<p><img src="Grimaldimemoirs_front.jpg" title="fig:Grimaldi&#39;s Memoirs, edited by Charles Dickens" alt="Grimaldi&#39;s Memoirs, edited by Charles Dickens" /> After Grimaldi's death, <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> was invited by <a href="Richard_Bentley_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Richard Bentley</a> to edit and improve Thomas Egerton Wilks's clumsily written life of Grimaldi, which had been based on the clown's own notes. As a child, Dickens saw Grimaldi perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester, in 1820.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> The <em><a href="Memoirs_of_Joseph_Grimaldi" title="wikilink">Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi</a></em> sold well, to Dickens's surprise.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|<a href="John_Forster_(biographer)" title="wikilink">John Forster</a> quotes an unpublished letter in which Dickens responds to the accusation that he must not have seen Grimaldi in person: &quot;Now, Sir, although I was brought up from remote country parts in the dark ages of 1819 and 1820 to behold the splendour of Christmas pantomimes and the humour of Joe, in whose honour I am informed I clapped my hands with great precocity, and although I even saw him act in the remote times of 1823Â ... I am willingÂ ... to concede that I had not arrived at man's estate when Grimaldi left the stage&quot;.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> When Dickens arrived in <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">America</a> for the first time in 1842, he stayed at the <a href="Tremont_House_(Boston)" title="wikilink">Tremont House</a>, America's &quot;pioneer first-class hotel&quot;. Dickens &quot;bounded into the Tremont's foyer shouting out 'Here we are!', Grimaldi's famous catch-phrase and as such entirely appropriate for a great and cherished entertainer making his entrance upon a new stage.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Later, Dickens was known to imitate Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a>|group= n}}</p>
<p>Grimaldi became &quot;easily the most popular English entertainer of his day&quot;.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> His fame was established primarily by his numerous successes as Clown in pantomimes. His Clown satirised many aspects of contemporary British life, and made comic mockery of absurdities in fashion. Grimaldi quickly became the most famous Clown in London, gradually transforming the Clown character from a pratfalling country bumpkin into the most important character in the harlequinade, more important even than Harlequin. He expanded the role of Clown to include a range of comic impersonations, from the rival suitor, to household cook or nurse. Grimaldi's popularity changed the balance of the evening's entertainment, so that the first, relatively serious, section of the pantomime soon dwindled to &quot;little more than a pretext for determining the characters who were to be transformed into those of the harlequinade.&quot; He became so dominant in the harlequinade that later Clowns were known as &quot;Joey&quot;, and the term, as well as his make-up design, were later generalized to other types of clowns.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a><a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<p>A contributor to <em><a href="Bentley&#39;s_Miscellany" title="wikilink">Bentley's Miscellany</a></em> wrote in 1846: &quot;To those who never saw him, description is fruitless; to those who have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of him.

<p>Grimaldi is remembered today in an annual memorial service on the first Sunday in February, at Holy Trinity Church in the <a href="London_Borough_of_Hackney" title="wikilink">London Borough of Hackney</a>.
