<p>Like many artists, Houston's previous efforts featured material mostly chosen by the label. With this project, however, she had more control over the album's content.

Houston would also produce the song &quot;I'm Knockin'&quot;, with tour music director Ricky Minor and co-write the song &quot;Takin' a Chance&quot;.</p>
