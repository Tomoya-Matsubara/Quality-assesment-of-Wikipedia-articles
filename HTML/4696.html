<p><strong>Madagascar</strong>, officially the <strong>Republic of Madagascar</strong> ( ; ) and previously known as the <strong><a href="Malagasy_Republic" title="wikilink">Malagasy Republic</a></strong>, is an <a href="island_country" title="wikilink">island country</a> in the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>, off the southeastern coast of <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondwana</a>, Madagascar split from <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a <a href="biodiversity_hotspot" title="wikilink">biodiversity hotspot</a>; over 90 percent of <a href="wildlife_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">its wildlife</a> is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population.</p>
<p>Initial human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BCE and 550 AD by <a href="Austronesian_peoples" title="wikilink">Austronesian peoples</a> arriving on <a href="outrigger_canoe" title="wikilink">outrigger canoes</a> from <a href="Borneo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borneo</a>. These were joined around 1000 CE by <a href="Bantu_peoples" title="wikilink">Bantu</a> migrants crossing the <a href="Mozambique_Channel" title="wikilink">Mozambique Channel</a>. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The <a href="Malagasy_people" title="wikilink">Malagasy ethnic group</a> is often divided into eighteen or more <a href="Ethnic_groups_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">sub-groups</a> of which the largest are the <a href="Merina_people" title="wikilink">Merina</a> of the central highlands.</p>
<p>Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting socio-political alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the <a href="Merina_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Madagascar</a> by a <a href="List_of_Malagasy_monarchs" title="wikilink">series</a> of Merina <a href="andriana" title="wikilink">nobles</a>. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the <a href="French_colonial_empire" title="wikilink">French colonial empire</a>, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed Republics. Since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at <a href="Antananarivo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antananarivo</a>. However, in a <a href="2009_Malagasy_political_crisis" title="wikilink">popular uprising in 2009</a> the last elected president <a href="Marc_Ravalomanana" title="wikilink">Marc Ravalomanana</a> was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to <a href="Andry_Rajoelina" title="wikilink">Andry Rajoelina</a> in a move widely viewed by the international community as a <em><a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a></em>.</p>
<p>In 2012, the population of Madagascar was estimated at just over 22 million, 90 percent of whom live on less than two dollars per day. <a href="Malagasy_language" title="wikilink">Malagasy</a> and <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> are both <a href="official_language" title="wikilink">official languages</a> of the state. The majority of the population adheres to <a href="Malagasy_mythology" title="wikilink">traditional beliefs</a>, <a href="Christianity_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana these investments produced substantial economic growth but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Malagasy_language" title="wikilink">Malagasy language</a>, the island of Madagascar is called <em>Madagasikara</em>  and its people are referred to as <em><a href="Malagasy_people" title="wikilink">Malagasy</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The island's appellation &quot;Madagascar&quot; is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> by Europeans.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The name <em>Madageiscar</em> was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer <a href="Marco_Polo" title="wikilink">Marco Polo</a> as a corrupted form of the name <a href="Mogadishu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mogadishu</a>, the <a href="Somalia" title="wikilink">Somali</a> port with which Polo had confused the island. On <a href="Lawrence_of_Rome" title="wikilink">St. Laurence</a>'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer <a href="Diogo_Dias" title="wikilink">Diogo Dias</a> landed on the island and christened it <em>S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Louren&lt;U+00E7&gt;o</em>, but Polo's name was preferred and popularized on <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating <em>Madagasikara</em> appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondwana</a> separated the Madagascar-Antarctica-India landmass from the Africa-South America landmass around 135 million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88 million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep <a href="escarpment" class="uri" title="wikilink">escarpment</a> containing much of the island's remaining tropical <a href="Madagascar_lowland_forests" title="wikilink">lowland forest</a>.</p>
<p>To the west of this ridge lies a <a href="plateau" class="uri" title="wikilink">plateau</a> in the center of the island ranging in altitude from  above sea level. These <a href="Central_Highlands_(Madagascar)" title="wikilink">central highlands</a>, traditionally the homeland of the <a href="Merina_people" title="wikilink">Merina people</a> and the location of their historic capital at <a href="Antananarivo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antananarivo</a>, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the <a href="Madagascar_subhumid_forests" title="wikilink">subhumid forests</a> that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the <a href="Mozambique_Channel" title="wikilink">Mozambique Channel</a> and <a href="Madagascar_mangroves" title="wikilink">mangrove swamps</a> along the coast.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>  Madagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland <a href="massif" title="wikilink">massifs</a>: <a href="Maromokotro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maromokotro</a>  on the <a href="Tsaratanana_Massif#Tsaratanana_Massif" title="wikilink">Tsaratanana Massif</a> is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak  on the <a href="Andringitra_Massif" title="wikilink">Andringitra Massif</a> and Tsiafajavona  on the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the <em><a href="Canal_des_Pangalanes" title="wikilink">Canal des Pangalanes</a></em> is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some . The western and southern sides, which lie in the <a href="rain_shadow" title="wikilink">rain shadow</a> of the central highlands, are home to <a href="Madagascar_dry_deciduous_forests" title="wikilink">dry deciduous forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar_spiny_thickets" title="wikilink">spiny forests</a>, and <a href="deserts_and_xeric_shrublands" title="wikilink">deserts and xeric shrublands</a>. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by <a href="sediment" class="uri" title="wikilink">sediment</a> from the high levels of inland <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The combination of southeastern <a href="trade_winds" title="wikilink">trade winds</a> and northwestern <a href="monsoons" class="uri" title="wikilink">monsoons</a> produces a hot rainy season (November&lt;U+2013&gt;April) with frequently destructive <a href="cyclones" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyclones</a>, and a relatively cooler dry season (May&lt;U+2013&gt;October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's <a href="rain_forest" title="wikilink">rain forest</a> ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a <a href="semi-arid_climate" title="wikilink">semi-arid climate</a> prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">Tropical cyclones</a> annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 2004 <a href="Cyclone_Gafilo" title="wikilink">Cyclone Gafilo</a> became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar.

<p>As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Approximately 90 percent of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are <a href="endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> including the <a href="lemur" title="wikilink">lemurs</a> (a type of <a href="prosimian" class="uri" title="wikilink">prosimian</a> primate), the carnivorous <a href="fossa_(animal)" title="wikilink">fossa</a> and many birds.

<p>Like its flora, Madagascar's fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism. Lemurs have been characterized as &quot;Madagascar's flagship mammal species&quot; by Conservation International.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In the absence of <a href="monkey" title="wikilink">monkeys</a> and other competitors, these <a href="primate" title="wikilink">primates</a> have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species. As of 2012, there were officially <a href="List_of_lemur_species" title="wikilink">103 species and subspecies of lemur</a>,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> They are almost all classified as rare, vulnerable, or endangered. At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since man arrived on Madagascar, all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A number of other mammals, including the cat-like <a href="Fossa_(animal)" title="wikilink">fossa</a>, are endemic to Madagascar.

<h3 id="environmental-challenges">Environmental challenges</h3>

<p>Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Since the arrival of humans around 2,350 years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90 percent of its original forest.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> This forest loss is largely fueled by <em>tavy</em> (&quot;fat&quot;), a traditional <a href="slash-and-burn" class="uri" title="wikilink">slash-and-burn</a> agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (<em>fomba malagasy</em>).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> According to a conservative estimate, about 40 percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80 percent.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President <a href="Marc_Ravalomanana" title="wikilink">Marc Ravalomanana</a> from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and has dramatically intensified under the administration of current head of state <a href="Andry_Rajoelina" title="wikilink">Andry Rajoelina</a> as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ouster.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> It is anticipated that all the island's rainforests, excluding those in protected areas and the steepest eastern mountain slopes, will have been deforested by 2025.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>  Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island's <a href="elephant_bird" title="wikilink">elephant birds</a>, a family of endemic giant <a href="ratite" title="wikilink">ratites</a>, went extinct in 17th century or earlier, most probably due to human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Numerous <a href="Subfossil_lemur" title="wikilink">giant lemur</a> species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since the 2009 coup has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. By contrast, a previous study in 2008 had found only 38 percent of lemur species were at risk of extinction.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as <em><a href="sorabe" class="uri" title="wikilink">sorabe</a></em>), Arab astrology and other cultural elements.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> European contact began in 1500, when the <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> sea captain <a href="Diogo_Dias" title="wikilink">Diogo Dias</a> sighted the island.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the <a href="Atlantic_slave_trade" title="wikilink">trans-Atlantic slave trade</a>. The small island of <a href="&lt;U+00CE&gt;le_Sainte-Marie" title="wikilink">Nosy Boroha</a> off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of <a href="Libertalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libertalia</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them <a href="Robert_Drury_(sailor)" title="wikilink">Robert Drury</a>, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Among these were the <a href="Betsimisaraka_people" title="wikilink">Betsimisaraka</a> alliance of the eastern coast and the <a href="Sakalava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sakalava</a> chiefdoms of <a href="Menabe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menabe</a> and <a href="Boina_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Boina</a> on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the <a href="Rova_of_Antananarivo" title="wikilink">royal palace</a> of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

Following a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King <a href="Andrianampoinimerina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andrianampoinimerina</a> (1787&lt;U+2013&gt;1810).<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> From his initial capital <a href="Ambohimanga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ambohimanga</a>,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> and later from the <a href="Rova_of_Antananarivo" title="wikilink">Rova of Antananarivo</a>, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King <a href="Radama_I" title="wikilink">Radama I</a> (1810&lt;U+2013&gt;28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a> to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the <a href="London_Missionary_Society" title="wikilink">London Missionary Society</a> began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as <a href="James_Cameron_(missionary)" title="wikilink">James Cameron</a>, <a href="David_Jones_(missionary)" title="wikilink">David Jones</a> and <a href="David_Griffiths_(missionary)" title="wikilink">David Griffiths</a>, who established schools, transcribed the <a href="Malagasy_language" title="wikilink">Malagasy language</a> using the <a href="Latin_alphabet" title="wikilink">Roman alphabet</a>, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Radama's successor, Queen <a href="Ranavalona_I" title="wikilink">Ranavalona I</a> (1828&lt;U+2013&gt;61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of <a href="Christianity_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Christianity in Madagascar</a> and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were <a href="Jean_Laborde" title="wikilink">Jean Laborde</a>, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and <a href="Joseph-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Lambert" title="wikilink">Joseph-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Lambert</a>, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince <a href="Radama_II" title="wikilink">Radama II</a> signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861&lt;U+2013&gt;63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was <a href="Radama_II#Assassination_plot" title="wikilink">overthrown</a> two years later by Prime Minister <a href="Rainivoninahitriniony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rainivoninahitriniony</a> (1852&lt;U+2013&gt;1865) and an alliance of <em><a href="Andriana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andriana</a></em> (noble) and <em><a href="Hova_(Madagascar)" title="wikilink">Hova</a></em> (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen <a href="Rasoherina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rasoherina</a> (1863&lt;U+2013&gt;68) the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister&lt;U+2014&gt;a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister <a href="Rainilaiarivony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rainilaiarivony</a> (1864&lt;U+2013&gt;95), who would go on to marry Queen <a href="Ranavalona_II" title="wikilink">Ranavalona II</a> (1868&lt;U+2013&gt;83) and Queen <a href="Ranavalona_III" title="wikilink">Ranavalona III</a> (1883&lt;U+2013&gt;97) in succession.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="french-colonization">French colonization</h3>

<p>Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first <a href="Franco-Hova_War" title="wikilink">Franco-Hova War</a>.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of <a href="Antsiranana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antsiranana</a> (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French <a href="protectorate" class="uri" title="wikilink">protectorate</a> on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of <a href="Toamasina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toamasina</a> on the east coast, and <a href="Mahajanga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahajanga</a> on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> A French military <a href="flying_column" title="wikilink">flying column</a> then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases.

Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on <a href="R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union" title="wikilink">Reunion Island</a> and to Algeria. A two-year <a href="Menalamba_rebellion" title="wikilink">resistance movement</a> organized in response to the French capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

The <a href="Malagasy_Republic" title="wikilink">First Republic</a> (1960&lt;U+2013&gt;72), under the leadership of French-appointed President <a href="Philibert_Tsiranana" title="wikilink">Philibert Tsiranana</a>, was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this &quot;neo-colonial&quot; arrangement inspired a series of student protests that overturned his administration in 1972.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Gabriel_Ramanantsoa" title="wikilink">Gabriel Ramanantsoa</a>, a Major General in the army, was appointed interim President and Prime Minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel <a href="Richard_Ratsimandrava" title="wikilink">Richard Ratsimandrava</a>, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General <a href="Gilles_Andriamahazo" title="wikilink">Gilles Andriamahazo</a> ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral <a href="Didier_Ratsiraka" title="wikilink">Didier Ratsiraka</a>, who ushered in the socialist-Marxist <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Second Republic</a> that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993. This period saw a political alignment with the <a href="Eastern_Bloc" title="wikilink">Eastern Bloc</a> countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the <a href="1973_oil_crisis" title="wikilink">1973 oil crisis</a>, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of <a href="Albert_Zafy" title="wikilink">Albert Zafy</a> (1993&lt;U+2013&gt;96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the <a href="Third_Republic_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Third Republic</a> (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;2010).<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The new <a href="constitution_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Madagascar constitution</a> established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, <a href="Norbert_Ratsirahonana" title="wikilink">Norbert Ratsirahonana</a>, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>The contested <a href="Malagasy_presidential_election,_2001" title="wikilink">2001 presidential elections</a> in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7 percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a <a href="2009_Malagasy_political_crisis" title="wikilink">movement in early 2009</a> in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a <em>coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</em>. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the <a href="High_Transitional_Authority" title="wikilink">High Transitional Authority</a>, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was <a href="Malagasy_constitutional_referendum,_2010" title="wikilink">adopted by referendum</a>, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The first round of the <a href="Malagasy_general_election,_2013" title="wikilink">2013 presidential election</a> was held on 25 October 2013 with parliamentary elections and a second presidential round scheduled on 20 December 2013.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana, following the 2001 presidential elections, cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> <a href="2009_Malagasy_protests" title="wikilink">A series of protests</a> led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The installation of Rajoelina's <a href="High_Transitional_Authority" title="wikilink">transitional regime</a> has, since March 2009, caused many bilateral donors and intergovernmental organizations to freeze aid and suspend regular diplomatic relations with Madagascar, causing economic development to stagnate and reversing many of the gains achieved under the previous administration. In addition, modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the <a href="Organisation_of_African_Unity" title="wikilink">Organisation of African Unity</a>, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the <a href="African_Union" title="wikilink">African Union</a>. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. However, Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the <a href="2009_Malagasy_political_crisis" title="wikilink">unconstitutional transfer of executive power</a> to Rajoelina.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Madagascar is a member of the <a href="International_Criminal_Court" title="wikilink">International Criminal Court</a> with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the <a href="United_States_military" title="wikilink">United States military</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> <a href="List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Eleven countries</a> have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannon and other firearms.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (<em>gendarmerie</em>) and the secret police.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Traditional community tribunals, called <em>dina</em>, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import&lt;U+2013&gt;export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75 percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50 percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>The IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the <a href="Millennium_Challenge_Account" title="wikilink">Millennium Challenge Account</a> in 2005.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810&lt;U+2013&gt;28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death. By the end of the 19th century Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> This policy, known as <em>malgachization</em>, coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="language">Language</h3>

<p>The Malagasy language is of <a href="Malayo-Polynesian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malayo-Polynesian</a> origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> can be clustered under one of two sub-groups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo; and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a <a href="francophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">francophone</a> country, and French is spoken among the educated population.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p>No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the <a href="Malagasy_constitutional_referendum,_2010" title="wikilink">November referendum 2010</a>.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition or by the <a href="international_community" title="wikilink">international community</a>, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the organization of the election by the <a href="High_Transitional_Authority" title="wikilink">High Transitional Authority</a>.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>

<p><img src="Famadihana_reburial_razana_ancestor_Madagascar.jpg" title="fig:Famadihana reburial ceremony" alt="Famadihana reburial ceremony" /> Approximately half of the country's population practice traditional religion,<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> which tends to emphasize links between the living and the <em>razana</em> (ancestors). The <a href="Veneration_of_the_dead" title="wikilink">veneration of ancestors</a> has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the <em><a href="famadihana" class="uri" title="wikilink">famadihana</a></em>, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a <a href="hiragasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiragasy</a> troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to <em>fady</em>, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>Almost half the Malagasy are <a href="Christianity_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Christian</a>, with practitioners of Protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to <a href="Roman_Catholicism_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a>.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> In 1818 the <a href="London_Missionary_Society" title="wikilink">London Missionary Society</a> sent the first Christian missionaries to the island, where they built churches, translated the Bible into the Malagasy language and began to gain converts. Beginning in 1835 Queen <a href="Ranavalona_I" title="wikilink">Ranavalona I</a> persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt European cultural and political influence on the island. In 1869 a successor, Queen <a href="Ranavalona_II" title="wikilink">Ranavalona II</a>, converted the court to Christianity and encouraged Christian missionary activity, burning the <em><a href="sampy" class="uri" title="wikilink">sampy</a></em> (royal idols) in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a <a href="minister_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">Christian minister</a> to consecrate a <em>famadihana</em> reburial.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations (Roman Catholic, <a href="Church_of_Jesus_Christ_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar</a>, <a href="Malagasy_Lutheran_Church" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a>, and <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a>) and has been an influential force in Malagasy politics.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>

While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities. Today, <a href="Islam_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Muslims</a> constitute 7 percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of <a href="Mahajanga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahajanga</a> and <a href="Antsiranana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antsiranana</a>.

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<p>Each of the many ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize <em>fihavanana</em> (solidarity), <em>vintana</em> (destiny), <em>tody</em> (karma), and <em><a href="Hasina_(Madagascar)" title="wikilink">hasina</a></em>, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a><a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity and roles within the community.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> Malagasy people traditionally consult <em>Mpanandro</em> (&quot;Makers of the Days&quot;) to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or <em>famadihana</em>, according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the <em>ombiasy</em> (from <em>olona-be-hasina</em>, &quot;man of much virtue&quot;) of the southeastern <a href="Antemoro_people" title="wikilink">Antemoro</a> ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the <em><a href="valiha" class="uri" title="wikilink">valiha</a></em>, is a <a href="bamboo" class="uri" title="wikilink">bamboo</a> tube <a href="zither" class="uri" title="wikilink">zither</a> carried to Madagascar by early settlers from <a href="South_Kalimantan" title="wikilink">southern Borneo</a>, and is very similar in form to those found in <a href="Music_of_Indonesia" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="Music_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> today.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Traditional <a href="Architecture_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">houses in Madagascar</a> are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven <em><a href="lamba_(garment)" title="wikilink">lamba</a></em>, has evolved into a varied and refined art.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in <a href="Malagasy_cuisine" title="wikilink">Malagasy cuisine</a>, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. <a href="Cattle_raiding" title="wikilink">Cattle rustling</a>, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its <a href="hainteny" title="wikilink">oratory</a>, as expressed in the forms of <em>hainteny</em> (poetry), <em>kabary</em> (public discourse) and <em>ohabolana</em> (proverbs).<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a><a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the <em><a href="Ibonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ibonia</a></em>, has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as <a href="Jean-Joseph_Rabearivelo" title="wikilink">Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo</a>, who is considered Africa's first modern poet,<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> and <a href="Elie_Rajaonarison" title="wikilink">Elie Rajaonarison</a>, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Madagascar has also developed a rich <a href="Music_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">musical heritage</a>, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal <em><a href="salegy" class="uri" title="wikilink">salegy</a></em> or highland <em><a href="hiragasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiragasy</a></em> that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of <a href="Raffia_palm" title="wikilink">raffia</a> and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, <em>aloalo</em> funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the <a href="Zafimaniry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zafimaniry</a> people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's <a href="UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists" title="wikilink">list of Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2008.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> <a href="Embroidery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Embroidery</a> and <a href="drawn_thread_work" title="wikilink">drawn thread work</a> are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sport-and-recreation">Sport and recreation</h3>
<p>A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. <em><a href="Moraingy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moraingy</a></em>, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> The wrestling of zebu cattle (<em>tolon-omby</em>) is also practiced in many regions.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is <em><a href="fanorona" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanorona</a></em>, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King <a href="Andrianjaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andrianjaka</a> after his father <a href="Ralambo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ralambo</a> was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing <em>fanorona</em> to the detriment of his other responsibilities.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries. <a href="Rugby_union_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Rugby</a> is considered the national sport of Madagascar.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> <a href="Football_in_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Football</a> is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in <a href="p&lt;U+00E9&gt;tanque" class="uri" title="wikilink">p&lt;U+00E9&gt;tanque</a>, a French game similar to <a href="lawn_bowling" title="wikilink">lawn bowling</a>, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> <a href="Scouting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scouting</a> is represented in Madagascar by its <a href="Firaisan&#39;ny_Skotisma_eto_Madagasikara" title="wikilink">own local federation</a> of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn59">'The archaeological evidence for the earliest human presence in Madagascar comes from Andavakoera near Diego Suarez and is dated to AD420 (AD250-590, 2SDs) (Dewar &amp; Wright 1993). There is some indirect evidence for earlier human presence, but it is ambiguous. The oldest such potential evidence to our knowledge is cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated as 530BC to 300BC (Godfrey &amp; Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artefacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from <em>Cannabis/Humulus</em> pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200BP (Burney 1987). There is some suspicion however that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago, and in any case, there is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until c. AD1200. Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60BC and AD130 (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement, in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020BP and 3495BP (MacPhee &amp; Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.'
