<p><strong>Ben Hope</strong> is a mountain in northern <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. It is the most northerly <a href="Munro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munro</a>, standing alone in the flow country (bumpy, peat-covered moorland) south-east of Loch Hope in <a href="Sutherland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sutherland</a>. The mountain is a roughly triangular wedge, with a great crag on the west, with two lower shoulders to the south and northeast. <a href="Alpine_plant" title="wikilink">Alpine flowers</a> are abundant in season, although the ground is very rocky.</p>
<p>The principal route to the summit starts in Strathmore, to the west of the mountain, following the Alltnacaillich Burn which flows down through a gap in the west-facing crags. The route is steep, but well marked and not exposed. Approach from the east is rare, as there is a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not possible for walkers, as there is no path between the crags.</p>
<p>On a clear day the view from the summit includes the <a href="Pentland_Firth" title="wikilink">Pentland Firth</a>, <a href="Loch_Eriboll" title="wikilink">Loch Eriboll</a> and the nearby mountains of <a href="Arkle_(hill)" title="wikilink">Arkle</a> and <a href="Foinaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foinaven</a>.</p>
<p>Just south of the Alltnacaillich burn on the Strathmore road is the Dun Dornaigil <a href="Broch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Broch</a>.</p>
