<p><strong>Blaxploitation</strong> is a <a href="film_genre" title="wikilink">film genre</a> that emerged in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the early 1970s when many <a href="exploitation_film" title="wikilink">exploitation films</a> were made specifically (and perhaps exclusively) for an audience of urban <a href="black_people" title="wikilink">black people</a>; the word itself is a <a href="portmanteau" class="uri" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of the words &quot;black&quot; and &quot;exploitation.&quot; Blaxploitation films were the first to feature <a href="soundtrack" title="wikilink">soundtracks</a> of <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> and <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul music</a>. These films starred primarily black actors.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>Variety</em> magazine</a> credited <em><a href="Sweet_Sweetback&#39;s_Baadasssss_Song" title="wikilink">Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</a></em> with the invention of the blaxploitation genre. Others argue that the Hollywood-financed film <em><a href="Shaft_(1971_film)" title="wikilink">Shaft</a></em> is closer to being blaxploitation, and thus is more likely to have begun the genre.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="common-qualities">Common qualities</h2>
<p>When set in the <a href="Northern_United_States" title="wikilink">Northeast</a> or <a href="Western_United_States" title="wikilink">West Coast</a> of the U.S., Blaxploitation films tend to take place in the <a href="ghetto" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghetto</a>, dealing with <a href="hit_man" title="wikilink">hit men</a>, <a href="drug_dealer" title="wikilink">drug dealers</a> and <a href="pimp" title="wikilink">pimps</a>. The genre frequently takes place in an atmosphere of crime and drug-dealing. <a href="Ethnic_slur" title="wikilink">Ethnic slurs</a> against whites (e.g., &quot;<a href="honky" class="uri" title="wikilink">honky</a>&quot;), and negative white characters like corrupt cops, politicians, prostitutes and gullible gangsters were common. Blaxploitation films set in the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">South</a> often take place on a <a href="plantation" class="uri" title="wikilink">plantation</a>, dealing with <a href="Slavery_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">slavery</a> and <a href="miscegenation" class="uri" title="wikilink">miscegenation</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Blaxploitation includes several types of films, including crime (<em><a href="Foxy_Brown_(film)" title="wikilink">Foxy Brown</a></em>), action/martial arts (<em><a href="Three_the_Hard_Way_(film)" title="wikilink">Three the Hard Way</a></em>), horror (<em><a href="Abby_(film)" title="wikilink">Abby</a></em>), comedy (<em><a href="Uptown_Saturday_Night" title="wikilink">Uptown Saturday Night</a></em>), nostalgia (<em><a href="Five_on_the_Black_Hand_Side" title="wikilink">Five on the Black Hand Side</a></em>), coming-of-age/courtroom drama (<em><a href="Cooley_High" title="wikilink">Cooley High</a>/<a href="Cornbread,_Earl_and_Me" title="wikilink">Cornbread, Earl and Me</a></em>), and musical (<em><a href="Sparkle_(1976_film)" title="wikilink">Sparkle</a></em>). The primary quality of the blaxploitation film is the targeted marketing to black audiences with the use of exploitable elements such as a black cast and subject matter of interest to <a href="Black-American" title="wikilink">Black-Americans</a>.</p>
<p>Following the lead of <em><a href="Sweet_Sweetback&#39;s_Baadasssss_Song" title="wikilink">Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</a></em>, many of these films featured <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> and <a href="soul_jazz" title="wikilink">soul jazz</a> soundtracks with heavy bass, funky beats and wah-wah guitars. These soundtracks are notable for a degree of complexity that was not common for radio-friendly funk tracks and rich orchestration that included uncommon instruments such as flutes and violins.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="stereotypes">Stereotypes</h2>
<p>These films were accused of stereotyping blacks--their target audience--as pimps and drug dealers. This dovetailed with common white stereotypes about black people, and as a result, many called for the end of the blaxploitation genre. The <a href="NAACP" class="uri" title="wikilink">NAACP</a>, the <a href="Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference" title="wikilink">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a>, and the <a href="Urban_League" title="wikilink">Urban League</a> joined together to form the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Backed by many black film professionals, this group received much media exposure and hastened the death of the genre by the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Blaxploitation films such as <em><a href="Mandingo_(film)" title="wikilink">Mandingo</a></em>, provided the opportunity for future filmmakers to address racial controversies regarding <a href="inner_city" title="wikilink">inner city</a> <a href="poverty" class="uri" title="wikilink">poverty</a>, and in the early 1990s, a new wave of acclaimed black filmmakers focused on black urban life in their movies, particularly <a href="Spike_Lee" title="wikilink">Spike Lee</a>'s <em><a href="Do_the_Right_Thing" title="wikilink">Do the Right Thing</a></em> and <a href="John_Singleton" title="wikilink">John Singleton</a>'s <em><a href="Boyz_N_the_Hood" title="wikilink">Boyz N the Hood</a></em>, among others.</p>

<h2 id="later-influence-and-media-references">Later influence and media references</h2>
<p>An early blaxploitation tribute can be seen in the character of &quot;Lite&quot; played by <a href="Sy_Richardson" title="wikilink">Sy Richardson</a> in <em><a href="Repo_Man_(film)" title="wikilink">Repo Man</a></em> (1984).

<p>Later movies such as <em><a href="Austin_Powers_in_Goldmember" title="wikilink">Austin Powers in Goldmember</a></em> (2002), <em><a href="Superbad_(film)" title="wikilink">Superbad</a></em> (2007), and <em><a href="Undercover_Brother" title="wikilink">Undercover Brother</a></em> (2002), as well as <a href="Quentin_Tarantino" title="wikilink">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s <em><a href="Jackie_Brown_(film)" title="wikilink">Jackie Brown</a></em> (1997), <em><a href="Kill_Bill" title="wikilink">Kill Bill</a>, Vol. 1</em> (2003), and '' <a href="Death_Proof" title="wikilink">Death Proof</a>'' (2007) feature <a href="pop_culture" title="wikilink">pop culture</a> nods to the blaxploitation genre. The parody <em>Undercover Brother</em>, for instance, starred <a href="Eddie_Griffin" title="wikilink">Eddie Griffin</a> as an Afro-topped agent for a clandestine organization satirically known as the <em>&quot;B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D.&quot;</em> Likewise, <em>Austin Powers in Goldmember</em> co-stars <a href="Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Knowles" title="wikilink">Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles</a> as the <a href="Tamara_Dobson" title="wikilink">Tamara Dobson</a>/<a href="Pam_Grier" title="wikilink">Pam Grier</a>-inspired <a href="hero" title="wikilink">heroine</a>, <em><a href="Foxxy_Cleopatra" title="wikilink">Foxxy Cleopatra</a>.</em> In the 1977 parody film <em><a href="The_Kentucky_Fried_Movie" title="wikilink">The Kentucky Fried Movie</a></em>, a mock trailer for <em>Cleopatra Schwartz</em> depicts another Pam Grier-like action star married to a Rabbi. Furthermore, the acclaimed film <em>auteur</em> and noted fan of <a href="exploitation_film" title="wikilink">exploitation films</a>, <a href="Quentin_Tarantino" title="wikilink">Quentin Tarantino</a>, has made countless references to the blaxploitation genre in his films, in addition to <em>Jackie Brown</em>. In a famous scene in <em><a href="Reservoir_Dogs" title="wikilink">Reservoir Dogs</a></em>, for instance, the main characters engage in a brief discussion regarding <em><a href="Get_Christie_Love!" title="wikilink">Get Christie Love!</a></em>, a mid-1970s blaxploitation <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a>. Similarly, in the catalytic scene of <em><a href="True_Romance" title="wikilink">True Romance</a></em>, the characters are seen viewing the movie <em><a href="The_Mack" title="wikilink">The Mack</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="John_Singleton" title="wikilink">John Singleton</a>'s remake of <em><a href="Shaft_(2000_film)" title="wikilink">Shaft</a></em> (2000) is a modern-day interpretation of a classic blaxploitation film. The 1997 film <em>Hoodlum</em> starring <a href="Laurence_Fishburne" title="wikilink">Laurence Fishburne</a> was an attempt at gangster blaxploitation, portraying a fictional account of black mobster <a href="Ellsworth_&quot;Bumpy&quot;_Johnson" title="wikilink">Ellsworth &quot;Bumpy&quot; Johnson</a>. In 2004, <a href="Mario_Van_Peebles" title="wikilink">Mario Van Peebles</a>, Melvin's son, released <em><a href="Baadasssss!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baadasssss!</a></em>, a movie based on the making of his father's movie in which Mario played his father. 2007's <a href="American_Gangster_(film)" title="wikilink">American Gangster</a>, based on the true story of heroin dealer <a href="Frank_Lucas" title="wikilink">Frank Lucas</a>, takes place in the early 1970s in Harlem and has many elements similar in style to blaxploitation films, specifically when the song <a href="Across_110th_Street" title="wikilink">Across 110th Street</a> is played.</p>
<p>Furthermore, blaxploitation films have made a profound impact on contemporary <a href="hip_hop_culture" title="wikilink">hip hop culture</a>. Several prominent <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> artists including <a href="Snoop_Dogg" title="wikilink">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="Big_Daddy_Kane" title="wikilink">Big Daddy Kane</a>, <a href="Ice_T" title="wikilink">Ice T</a>, <a href="Slick_Rick" title="wikilink">Slick Rick</a>, and <a href="Too_Short" title="wikilink">Too Short</a>) have taken the no-nonsense <a href="pimp" class="uri" title="wikilink">pimp</a> persona popularized first by ex-pimp <a href="Iceberg_Slim" title="wikilink">Iceberg Slim</a>'s 1967 book <em>Pimp</em> and then by films such as <em><a href="Super_Fly_(film)" title="wikilink">Super Fly</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Mack" title="wikilink">The Mack</a></em>, and <em><a href="Willie_Dynamite" title="wikilink">Willie Dynamite</a></em>, as inspiration for their own works. In fact, many hip-hop artists have paid tribute to pimping within their lyrics (most notably <a href="50_Cent" title="wikilink">50 Cent</a>'s hit single &quot;<em><a href="P.I.M.P." class="uri" title="wikilink">P.I.M.P.</a></em>&quot;) and have openly embraced the pimp image in their <a href="music_videos" title="wikilink">music videos</a>, by including entourages of scantily-clad women, flashy jewelry (known as &quot;<em><a href="bling-bling" class="uri" title="wikilink">bling-bling</a></em>&quot;), and luxury <a href="Cadillac_Eldorado" title="wikilink">Cadillacs</a> (referred to as &quot;<em><a href="pimpmobile" title="wikilink">pimpmobiles</a></em>&quot;). Perhaps the most famous scene of <em><a href="The_Mack" title="wikilink">The Mack</a></em>, featuring the &quot;Annual <a href="Players_Ball" title="wikilink">Players Ball</a>&quot;, has become an often-referenced <a href="pop_culture" title="wikilink">pop culture</a> icon, most recently by <em><a href="Chappelle&#39;s_Show" title="wikilink">Chapelle's Show</a></em>, where it was parodied as the &quot;<em>Player-Haters&lt;U+2019&gt; Ball</em>.&quot; The genre's overseas influence extends to artists such as Norway's <a href="Madcon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madcon</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Blaxploitation's influence has carried over into the new medium of webcomics. In 2009, cartoonist Jay Potts introduced <em>World Of Hurt</em>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> a serial, adventure webcomic that pays homage to Black action movies of the 1970s, such as <em>Shaft</em> or <em>Slaughter's Big Rip-Off</em>. However, unlike most recent works that reference Blaxploitation, the genre is treated seriously within the strip, not as a source of parody or humor.</p>
<p>In the <a href="2000s_(decade)" title="wikilink">2000s</a>, the term 'Brownsploitation' was termed as a play on the word in literary circles, referring to the body of conspiracy fiction that became popular after the success of author <a href="Dan_Brown" title="wikilink">Dan Brown</a>'s &quot;<a href="The_Da_Vinci_Code" title="wikilink">The Da Vinci Code</a>&quot; and its <a href="prequel" class="uri" title="wikilink">prequel</a>, &quot;<a href="Angels_and_Demons" title="wikilink">Angels and Demons</a>.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="cultural-references-and-parodies">Cultural references and parodies</h2>
<p>The notoriety of the genre has led to a number of <a href="parody" title="wikilink">parodies</a>, some of them humorous, others satirical. The earliest attempts to mock the genre, <a href="Ralph_Bakshi" title="wikilink">Ralph Bakshi</a>'s <em><a href="Coonskin_(film)" title="wikilink">Coonskin</a></em> and <a href="Rudy_Ray_Moore" title="wikilink">Rudy Ray Moore</a>'s <em><a href="Dolemite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dolemite</a></em>, were both made during the heyday of the genre, in 1975. The satirical film <em>Coonskin</em> was intended to deconstruct racial stereotypes ranging from early <a href="minstrel_show" title="wikilink">minstrel show</a> stereotypes to more recent stereotypes found in blaxploitation films of the era. However, the work encountered a strong amount of controversy before its release when it was protested by the <a href="Congress_of_Racial_Equality" title="wikilink">Congress of Racial Equality</a>, and its distribution was handed to a smaller distributor who advertised <em>Coonskin</em> as an exploitation film. However, it developed a cult followinng with black viewers.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <em>Dolemite</em> was less serious in tone and produced as a spoof. <em>Dolemite</em> centered around a sexually active black pimp played by Moore, who based the film on his <a href="stand-up_comedy" title="wikilink">stand-up comedy</a> act. The film was followed by a sequel, <em><a href="The_Human_Tornado" title="wikilink">The Human Tornado</a></em>.</p>
<p>Later spoofs parodying the blaxploitation genre include <em><a href="I&#39;m_Gonna_Git_You_Sucka" title="wikilink">I&lt;U+2019&gt;m Gonna Git You Sucka</a></em>, <em><a href="Pootie_Tang" title="wikilink">Pootie Tang</a></em>, <em><a href="Undercover_Brother" title="wikilink">Undercover Brother</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Hebrew_Hammer" title="wikilink">The Hebrew Hammer</a></em>, which featured a <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> protagonist, and was jokingly referred to by its director as a &quot;<em>Jewsploitation</em>&quot; film.</p>
<p>A more recent parody is the invention of the <em><a href="Botsploitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Botsploitation</a></em> genre championed by the website botsploitation.com featuring robotic version of famous cultural personalities.</p>
<p><a href="Robert_Townsend_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Townsend</a>'s comedy <em><a href="Hollywood_Shuffle" title="wikilink">Hollywood Shuffle</a></em> features a young black actor who is tempted to take part in a white-produced blaxploitation film.</p>
<p>The <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> series <em><a href="Cowboy_Bebop" title="wikilink">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> features several episodes with blaxploitation themes, particularly <em>Mushroom Samba</em> which extensively parodies blaxploitation movies.</p>
<p><em><a href="The_Onion" title="wikilink">The Onion's</a></em> book <em><a href="Our_Dumb_Century" title="wikilink">Our Dumb Century</a></em> has an article from the 1970s entitled &quot;Congress Passes Anti-Blaxploitation Act: Pimps, Players Subject to Heavy Fines.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="Fox_Entertainment_Group" title="wikilink">FOX</a>'s network television comedy, &quot;<a href="MADtv" class="uri" title="wikilink">MADtv</a>&quot;, has frequently spoofed the <a href="Rudy_Ray_Moore" title="wikilink">Rudy Ray Moore</a>-created franchise <em><a href="Dolemite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dolemite</a></em>, with a series of sketches performed by comic actor <a href="Aries_Spears" title="wikilink">Aries Spears</a>, in the role of <em>&quot;The Son of Dolemite.&quot;</em> Other sketches include the characters &quot;<a href="Funkenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funkenstein</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Dr._Funkenstein" title="wikilink">Dr. Funkenstein</a>&quot; and more recently <a href="Condoleezza_Rice" title="wikilink">Condoleezza Rice</a> as a blaxploitation superhero. A recurring theme in these sketches is the inexperience of the cast and crew in the Blaxploitation era, with emphasis on ridiculous scripting and shoddy acting, sets, costumes and editing. The sketches are testaments to the poor production quality of the films, with obvious boom mike appearances and intentionally poor cuts and continuity. There was even an episode where the Son of Dolemite met and faced off against <a href="Black_Belt_Jones" title="wikilink">Black Belt Jones</a>.</p>
<p>In the movie <em><a href="Leprechaun_in_the_Hood" title="wikilink">Leprechaun in the Hood</a></em>, a character played by <a href="Ice-T" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ice-T</a> pulls a baseball bat from his afro; this scene is a satire of a similar scene in <em><a href="Foxy_Brown_(1974_film)" title="wikilink">Foxy Brown</a></em>, in which <a href="Pam_Grier" title="wikilink">Pam Grier</a> hides a revolver in her afro.</p>
<p>Adult Swim's <em><a href="Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force" title="wikilink">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em> series has a recurring character called &quot;Boxy Brown&quot; (A play on <a href="Foxy_Brown_(1974_film)" title="wikilink">Foxy Brown</a>, a lead character in another blaxploitation film). An imaginary friend of <a href="Meatwad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meatwad</a>, Boxy Brown is a cardboard box with a crudely drawn face with a goatee on it that dons an afro. Whenever Boxy speaks, &lt;U+2019&gt;70s funk music, typical of blaxploitation films, is played in the background. The cardboard box also fronts a confrontational attitude and <a href="Jive_(dialect)" title="wikilink">dialect</a> similar to many heroes of this film genre.</p>
<p>Some of the TVs found in the action video game <em><a href="Max_Payne_2:_The_Fall_of_Max_Payne" title="wikilink">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</a></em> feature a blaxploitation-themed parody of the original <em><a href="Max_Payne" title="wikilink">Max Payne</a></em> game called <em>Dick Justice</em>, after its main character. In the original Max Payne, there is a dialogue between two mercenaries, one of whom admits that he has christened his gun &quot;Dick Justice.&quot; Dick behaves much like the original Max Payne (down to the &quot;constipated&quot; grimace and metaphorical speech) but wears an afro and mustache, and talks in <a href="African_American_Vernacular_English" title="wikilink">Ebonics</a>.</p>
