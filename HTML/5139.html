<p><strong><em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em></strong> is the sixth studio album by American <a href="industrial_rock" title="wikilink">industrial rock</a> act <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails</a>, released on March 2, 2008. The team behind the project included Nine Inch Nails front man <a href="Trent_Reznor" title="wikilink">Trent Reznor</a>, studio-collaborators <a href="Atticus_Ross" title="wikilink">Atticus Ross</a> and <a href="Alan_Moulder" title="wikilink">Alan Moulder</a>, and instrumental contributions from <a href="Alessandro_Cortini" title="wikilink">Alessandro Cortini</a>, <a href="Adrian_Belew" title="wikilink">Adrian Belew</a>, and <a href="Brian_Viglione" title="wikilink">Brian Viglione</a>. Reznor described the music of <em>Ghosts</em> as &quot;a soundtrack for daydreams&quot;, a sentiment echoed by many critics who compared it with the work of <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Robert_Fripp" title="wikilink">Robert Fripp</a>. The songs are unnamed, and are identified only by their track listing, position, and album art.</p>
<p>The album is the first independent release from Nine Inch Nails following its announcement that it had severed its ties with <a href="Interscope_Records" title="wikilink">Interscope Records</a>. Initially intended to be a five-track <a href="Extended_Play" title="wikilink">EP</a>, the final release consists of four nine-track instrumental EPs, totaling 36 tracks. The album was released under a <a href="Creative_Commons" title="wikilink">Creative Commons</a> license, and in a variety of differing packages at various <a href="price_point" title="wikilink">price points</a>, including a <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>300 &quot;Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition&quot;. <em>Ghosts</em> was initially released digitally on the official Nine Inch Nails website without any prior advertisement or promotion. Via the official Nine Inch Nails <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> profile, a user-generated &quot;film festival&quot; was announced, where fans were invited to visually interpret the album's music and post their results.</p>
<p>Critical reception of the album has been generally favorable, with its unorthodox release attracting positive comments from many critics. Much coverage of <em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> has compared it to the digital-download releases of <a href="Radiohead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radiohead</a>'s <em><a href="In_Rainbows" title="wikilink">In Rainbows</a></em> as well as <a href="Saul_Williams" title="wikilink">Saul Williams</a>' <em><a href="The_Inevitable_Rise_and_Liberation_of_NiggyTardust!" title="wikilink">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</a></em>. The album was nominated for two <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>, in the categories &quot;Best Rock Instrumental Performance&quot; and &quot;Best Box Set or Limited Edition Package&quot;. These nominations represented the first time music released under a Creative Commons license had been nominated for a Grammy Award.</p>

Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch Nails would likely distribute its next album independently, possibly in a fashion similar to <a href="rapper" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapper</a> <a href="Saul_Williams" title="wikilink">Saul Williams</a>' 2007 album <em><a href="The_Inevitable_Rise_and_Liberation_of_NiggyTardust!" title="wikilink">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</a></em>, which Reznor produced.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the Performance 2007 tour in support of the band's previous album <em><a href="Year_Zero_(album)" title="wikilink">Year Zero</a></em> (2007), Reznor set out to make a record &quot;with very little forethought&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> originated from an experiment: &quot;The rules were as follows: 10 weeks, no clear agenda, no overthinking, everything driven by impulse. Whatever happens during that time gets released as... something.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Reznor explained, &quot;I've been considering and wanting to make this kind of record for years, but by its very nature it wouldn't have made sense until this point&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The core creative team behind the project was Reznor, <a href="Atticus_Ross" title="wikilink">Atticus Ross</a>, and <a href="Alan_Moulder" title="wikilink">Alan Moulder</a>. <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails_live_performances" title="wikilink">Live-band</a> member <a href="Alessandro_Cortini" title="wikilink">Alessandro Cortini</a> and studio musicians <a href="Adrian_Belew" title="wikilink">Adrian Belew</a> and <a href="Brian_Viglione" title="wikilink">Brian Viglione</a> also contributed instrumental performances on select tracks.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Reznor described the band's early intentions for the project as &quot;an experiment&quot;, and explained the group's process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started working with the music, we would generally start with a sort of visual reference that we had imagined: a place, or a setting, or a situation. And then attempt to describe that with sound and texture and melody. And treat it, in a sense, as if it were a soundtrack.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The musicians created the album tracks through improvisation and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan to release a single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He revealed that Reznor's instructions to him were to &quot;build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff that you want to bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and [...] be creative&lt;U+2014&gt;See where your mind and your ideas take you.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from <em>Ghosts</em> for his contributions on <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a>, <a href="dulcimer" class="uri" title="wikilink">dulcimer</a>, and electronics. Cortini recounted in an interview that he was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and that his involvement evolved from &quot;first recording some extra parts to some tracks&quot; and eventually into &quot;a collaboration on [the] tracks noted in the booklet&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> is an almost entirely instrumental album, with only a few tracks containing sampled vocals. Reznor described the album's sound as &quot;the result of working from a very visual perspective&lt;U+2014&gt;dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="PopMatters" class="uri" title="wikilink">PopMatters</a>' review of the album compared its musical style to that of <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Robert_Fripp" title="wikilink">Robert Fripp</a>, ultimately categorizing it as &quot;<a href="dark_ambient" title="wikilink">dark ambient</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The review went on to describe the music as &quot;a tonal painting, a collection of moods and not all of these moods are good ones.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="National_Public_Radio" title="wikilink">National Public Radio</a> and <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>'s reviews also compared the album to the music of Brian Eno; the latter review compared the album's sound specifically to the instrumentals of <em><a href="Another_Green_World" title="wikilink">Another Green World</a></em> (1975) and the rhythm collages of <em><a href="My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_(album)" title="wikilink">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a></em> (1981).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="Robert_Christgau" title="wikilink">Robert Christgau</a> also compared the album to the work of Brian Eno, summarizing <em>Ghosts</em>' sound as &quot;mental wallpaper&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> features a wide assortment of musical instruments, including <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass</a>, <a href="synthesizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a>, <a href="marimba" class="uri" title="wikilink">marimba</a>, <a href="tambourine" class="uri" title="wikilink">tambourine</a>, <a href="banjo" class="uri" title="wikilink">banjo</a>, <a href="Appalachian_dulcimer" title="wikilink">dulcimer</a>, and <a href="xylophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">xylophone</a>, many of which were sampled and distorted electronically.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="Percussion_instrument" title="wikilink">Percussion instruments</a>, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and house-hold items.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>

<h3 id="film-festival">Film festival</h3>
<p>Nearly two weeks after the release of the album, Reznor organized and announced a user-created &quot;<a href="film_festival" title="wikilink">film festival</a>&quot; as an accompaniment to the album, hosted at the official Nine Inch Nails <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> channel.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was revealed that the album was stripped of much artwork and song titles to provide a blank canvas for the project.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Reznor explained that the endeavor was not meant as a contest, but as &quot;an experiment in collaboration and a chance for us to interact beyond the typical one-way artist-to-fan relationship.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Over 1,000 video submissions have been posted and over 6,000 members have joined the festival group since the beginning of the film festival in March 2008.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The official YouTube group states there is no set time limit for the video submission.

<p><em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> material was implemented into <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails_live_performances" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails live performances</a> typically as a distinct section of instrumental songs mid-way through the show.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <em>Ghosts</em> material was performed in this manner primarily as part of the &quot;Lights in the Sky&quot; tour in 2008, immediately after the album's release.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> During these segments the music was largely acoustic, as opposed to the electric instrumentation of other Nine Inch Nails live sets. The <em>Ghosts</em> segment included instrumentation from a <a href="marimba" class="uri" title="wikilink">marimba</a>, <a href="harmonium" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonium</a>, <a href="glockenspiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">glockenspiel</a>, <a href="double_bass" title="wikilink">double bass</a>, and various homemade percussion instruments.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The <em>Ghosts</em> section was later scrapped for the &quot;NINJA&quot; and &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot; tours, as Reznor felt the instrumental songs didn't fit with the set lists.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>The album's unorthodox distribution methods also garnered the attention of various news agencies, such as <em><a href="Wired_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Wired</a></em>'s Eliot Van Buskirk, who labeled <em>Ghosts</em> as &quot;a remarkably extensive release&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Ben Worthen of <em><a href="The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> hypothesized that &quot;most business execs [...] could learn a lot from [Reznor&lt;U+2019&gt;s] experiments with online business models.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Many news agencies compared the release to <a href="Radiohead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radiohead</a>'s 2007 &quot;pay-what-you-want&quot; digital release of <em><a href="In_Rainbows" title="wikilink">In Rainbows</a></em>, as well as the similar release of Saul Williams' album <em>The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</em> the same year, which Reznor produced. <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>'s review called the album a &quot;A new-media showpiece&quot;,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> while <a href="Tiny_Mix_Tapes" title="wikilink">Tiny Mix Tapes</a> said &quot;the circumstances surrounding the release are so forward-thinking that they could be considered just as key to appreciating the album as the music itself.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Business website <a href="Motley_Fool" title="wikilink">The Motley Fool</a> wrote an article on the album's release titled simply &quot;Music Industry Gets Nailed Again&quot;, forecasting that &quot;Innovators like Nine Inch Nails are paving the way for new media business models that may bypass the middleman while making sure artists <em>and</em> fans are happy.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In its review of <em>The Slip</em>, however, PopMatters described <em>Ghosts I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV</em> in retrospect as an &quot;aimless batch of [...] instrumentals packaged in a brilliant marketing scheme&quot; and that it was &quot;basically a CD release with a couple of mail-order special editions available for the 'true fans'.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
