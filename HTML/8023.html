<p><strong><em>The Disasters of War</em></strong> (Spanish: <strong><em>Los Desastres de la Guerra</em></strong>) is a series of 82<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="old_master_print" title="wikilink">prints</a> created between 1810 and 1820 by Spanish master painter and <a href="Printmaking" title="wikilink">printmaker</a> <a href="Francisco_Goya" title="wikilink">Francisco Goya</a> (1746&lt;U+2013&gt;1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention in creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 <a href="Dos_de_Mayo_Uprising" title="wikilink">Dos de Mayo Uprising</a>, the subsequent <a href="Peninsular_War" title="wikilink">Peninsular War</a> of 1808&lt;U+2013&gt;14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the <a href="Bourbon_Restoration" title="wikilink">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</a> in 1814.</p>
<p>During the conflicts between <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="First_French_Empire" title="wikilink">French Empire</a> and Spain, Goya retained his position as first <a href="court_painter" title="wikilink">court painter</a> to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish, French and English rulers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after the artist's death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The name by which the series is known today is not Goya's own. His handwritten title on an album of <a href="Artist&#39;s_proof" title="wikilink">proofs</a> given to a friend reads: <strong><em>Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices<strong>'' (</strong></em>Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enf&lt;U+00E1&gt;ticos</strong>'').<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, Goya breaks from a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.</p>
<p>The series was produced using a variety of <a href="Intaglio_(printmaking)" title="wikilink">intaglio printmaking</a> techniques, mainly <a href="etching" class="uri" title="wikilink">etching</a> for the line work and <a href="aquatint" class="uri" title="wikilink">aquatint</a> for the tonal areas, but also <a href="engraving" class="uri" title="wikilink">engraving</a> and <a href="drypoint" class="uri" title="wikilink">drypoint</a>. As with many other Goya prints, they are sometimes referred to as aquatints, but more often as etchings. They are usually considered in three groups which broadly mirror the order of their creation. The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811&lt;U+2013&gt;12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the <a href="Spanish_Constitution_of_1812" title="wikilink">Spanish Constitution of 1812</a> and opposed both state and religious reform. Since their first publication, Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the &quot;prodigious flowering of rage&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> as well as the &quot;work of a memory that knew no forgiveness.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The serial nature in which the plates unfold has led some to see the images as similar in nature to photography.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, it was politically and strategically important to the French. The reigning Spanish sovereign, <a href="Charles_IV_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Charles IV</a>, was internationally regarded as ineffectual,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and his position at the time was threatened by his pro-British heir, <a href="Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Crown Prince Ferdinand</a>.

<p>Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1808, <a href="Mutiny_of_Aranjuez" title="wikilink">a popular uprising</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;incited by Ferdinand's supporters&lt;U+2014&gt;saw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to <a href="abdication" title="wikilink">abdicate</a>; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as Ferdinand VII.

He had supported the initial aims of the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from <a href="feudalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudalism</a> to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced&lt;U+2014&gt;and the differences far more entrenched&lt;U+2014&gt;following the eventual withdrawal of the French.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Several of Goya's friends, including the poets <a href="Juan_Mel&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez_Vald&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" title="wikilink">Juan Mel&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez Vald&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a> and <a href="Leandro_Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez_de_Morat&lt;U+00ED&gt;n" title="wikilink">Leandro Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez de Morat&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>, were overt : the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, <a href="Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" title="wikilink">Wellington</a> from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for <em>The Disasters of War</em>. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as &quot;&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the dismemberment of Spain.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="plates">Plates</h2>
<p>Art historians broadly agree that <em>The Disasters of War</em> is divided into three thematic groupings&lt;U+2014&gt;war, famine, and political and cultural allegories. This sequence broadly reflects the order in which the plates were created. Few of the plates or drawings are dated; instead, their chronology has been established by identifying specific incidents to which the plates refer,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the different batches of plates used, which allow sequential groups to be divined. For the most part, Goya's numbering agrees with these other methods.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, there are several exceptions. For example, <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(01).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 1</a> was among the last to be completed, after the end of the war.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early plates of the war grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images typically show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, the distinction between the Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell from which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, <em>Con razon &lt;U+00F3&gt; sin ella</em> can mean <em>with or without reason</em>, <em>rightly or wrongly</em>, or <em>for something or for nothing</em>. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the &quot;heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost. </p>
<h3 id="war">War</h3>

<p>Plates 1 to 47 consist mainly of realistic depictions of the horrors of the war fought against the French. Most portray the aftermath of battle; they include mutilated torsos and limbs mounted on trees, like &quot;fragments of marble sculpture&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Both French and Spanish troops tortured and mutilated captives; evidence of such acts is minutely detailed across a number of Goya's plates.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Civilian death is also captured in detail. Spanish women were commonly victims of assault and rape. Civilians often followed armies to battle scenes. If their side won, women and children would search the battlefield for their husbands, fathers and sons. If they lost, they fled in fear of being raped or murdered.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(09).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 9</a>, <em>No quieren</em> (<em>They do not want to</em>), an elderly woman is shown wielding a knife in defence of a young girl who is being assaulted by a soldier.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

The following plates describe combat with the French, who&lt;U+2014&gt;according to art critic Vivien Raynor&lt;U+2014&gt;are depicted &quot;rather like <a href="Cossacks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cossacks</a>, bayoneting civilians&quot;, while Spanish civilians are shown &quot;poleaxing the French.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Plates 31 to 39 focus on atrocities, and were produced on the same batch of plates as the famine group.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Others are based on drawings Goya had completed in his <em>Sketchbook-journal</em>, in studies where he examined the theme of the grotesque body in relation to the iconography of the tortured or martyred one.

<p>Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's rejects the ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on individual participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The exception is <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(07).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 7</a>, <em>Que valor!</em> (<em>What courage!</em>), which depicts <a href="Agustina_de_Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Agustina de Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> (1786&lt;U+2013&gt;1857), the heroine of <a href="Zaragoza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zaragoza</a>, who brought food to the <a href="cannon" title="wikilink">cannoneers</a> at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Spaniards died.

<h3 id="famine">Famine</h3>

<p>The second group, plates 48 to 64, detail the effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after <a href="Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" title="wikilink">Wellington</a>'s armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In these plates, Goya's focus is directed away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.</p>
<p>Goya does not focus on the reasons for the shortage, nor does he apportion blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Hughes believes <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(50).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 50</a>, <em>Madre infeliz!</em> (<em>Unhappy mother!</em>), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents &quot;a darkness that seems to be the very essence of loss and orphanhood&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of <a href="aquatint" class="uri" title="wikilink">aquatint</a> in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were <a href="burnish" title="wikilink">burnished</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> </p>

<p>Plates 65 to 82 were named &quot;caprichos enf&lt;U+00E1&gt;ticos&quot; (&quot;emphatic <a href="Capriccio_(painting)" title="wikilink">caprices</a>&quot;) in Goya's original series title.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII's fall and return to power, they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post-war Spanish politics, including the <a href="Spanish_Inquisition" title="wikilink">Inquisition</a> and the then-common judicial practice of torture. Although peace was welcomed, it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before.

<p>After the six years of <a href="absolute_monarchy" title="wikilink">absolutism</a> that followed Ferdinand's return to the throne, on 1 January 1820, <a href="Rafael_del_Riego" title="wikilink">Rafael del Riego</a> initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the <a href="Spanish_Constitution_of_1812" title="wikilink">1812 Constitution</a>. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after <a href="Spanish_Civil_War,_1820&lt;U+2013&gt;1823" title="wikilink">an unstable period</a>, a French invasion supported by <a href="Quintuple_Alliance" title="wikilink">an alliance of the major powers</a> had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of these images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier <em><a href="Caprichos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caprichos</a></em>. <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(75).jpg" title="wikilink">Plate 75</a> <em>Far&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndula de charlatanes</em> (<em>Troupe of charlatans</em>) shows a priest with a parrot's head performing before an audience of donkeys and monkeys.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(77).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 77</a>, a pope walking a tightrope was &quot;prudently reduced&quot; to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and <a href="procession" title="wikilink">processional</a> images, are mocked and denigrated. <a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(67).jpg" title="wikilink">Plate 67</a>, <em>Esta no lo es menos</em> (<em>This is no less curious</em> ), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the &quot;Virgin of Solitude&quot;. In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stochita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, &quot;It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.&quot; Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were &quot;illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863.

<p>Goya completed 56 plates during the <a href="Peninsular_War" title="wikilink">war against France</a>, and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch&lt;U+2014&gt;including plate 1, several in the middle of the series, and the last 17 plates&lt;U+2014&gt;are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: <em>I saw this</em> (<a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(44).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 44</a>) and <em>One can not look</em> (<a href="commons:File:Goya-Guerra_(26).jpg" title="wikilink">plate 26</a>).<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups.

<p>The Berm&lt;U+00FA&gt;dez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> one plate had work added, and the printing was carried out with much more ink on the plates (producing &quot;surface tone&quot;) than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The Berm&lt;U+00FA&gt;dez set is considered &quot;uniquely important ... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small <em>Prisioneros</em>).</p>

<p>Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of <a href="Diego_Vel&lt;U+00E1&gt;zquez" title="wikilink">Diego Vel&lt;U+00E1&gt;zquez</a> to <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a>'s <em><a href="Guernica_(painting)" title="wikilink">Guernica</a></em> (1937). Reflecting on <em>The Disasters of War</em>, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth &quot;be seen and ... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it .... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life&lt;U+2014&gt;probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the <a href="Eighty_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Eighty Years' War</a> with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like <a href="Hans_Baldung" title="wikilink">Hans Baldung</a>.

<p>Goya abandons colour in the series, believing that light, shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, &quot;In art there is no need for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> He uses line not so much to delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, &quot;to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste ....

<p>In his 1947 book on Goya's etchings, English author <a href="Aldous_Huxley" title="wikilink">Aldous Huxley</a> observed that the images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes: darkened archways &quot;more sinister than those even of <a href="Giovanni_Battista_Piranesi" title="wikilink">Piranesi</a>'s <em>Prisons</em>&quot;; street corners as settings for the cruelty of the disparities of class; and silhouetted hilltops carrying the dead, sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses. &quot;And so the record proceeds, horror after horror, unalleviated by any of the splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war; for, significantly, Goya never illustrates an engagement, never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in the order of battle ....

In the third grouping of plates in the The Disasters of War Goya returned in part to the fantastical imagery he had explored in the Caprichos|alt=4 or 5 men fly with contraptions resembling bat&#39;s wings attached to their arms." /> Between 1815 and 1816, Goya produced the <em><a href="commons:Category:Tauromachia" title="wikilink">Tauromachia</a></em>, a series of 33 <a href="bullfighting" class="uri" title="wikilink">bullfighting</a> scenes, during a break from <em>The Disasters of War</em>. <em>Tauromachia</em> was not politically sensitive, and was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320&lt;U+2014&gt;for sale individually or in sets&lt;U+2014&gt;without incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In France, Goya completed a set of four larger lithographs, <em><a href="commons:Category:Los_toros_de_Burdeos" title="wikilink">Los toros de Burdeos</a></em> (<em>The Bulls of Bordeaux</em>).<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> His final series, known as <em><a href="commons:Category:Los_disparates" title="wikilink">Los Disparates</a></em> (<em>The Follies</em>), <em>Proverbios</em> (<em>Proverbs</em>), or <em>Sue&lt;U+00F1&gt;os</em> (<em>Dreams</em>), contains 22 large plates and at least five drawings that are seemingly part of the series but which were never etched. All these were left in Madrid&lt;U+2014&gt;apparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed&lt;U+2014&gt;when Goya went to France in 1823. One plate is known to have been etched in 1816, but little else is established about the chronology of the works, or Goya's plans for the set.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>Goya worked on <em>The Disasters of War</em> during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to the imagery of the <em>Caprichos</em>. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>In <em>The Disasters of War</em> there is no purpose to the random slaughter&lt;U+2014&gt;the plates are devoid of the consolation of either divine order or the dispensation of human justice.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> This is due in part to the lack of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as in works of <a href="Baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> <img src="Goya-Guerra_Cropped.jpg" title="fig:Title page of the first edition (1863)|alt=Title page reading &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra ... DON FRANCISCO GOYA.&quot; At bottom is a publisher&#39;s colophon and &quot;MADRID. 1863.&quot;" alt="Title page of the first edition (1863)|alt=Title page reading &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra ... DON FRANCISCO GOYA.&quot; At bottom is a publisher&#39;s colophon and &quot;MADRID. 1863.&quot;" width="200" /></p>
<p>The events occur in spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the picture plane in all directions.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In this way, the works underscore the randomness of violence; in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th- and 20th-century <a href="photojournalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">photojournalism</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier <em>Caprichos</em>, <em>The Disasters of War</em> is likely to have been intended as a &quot;social speech&quot;; satires on the then prevailing &quot;hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [and] the absence of wisdom&quot; of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believes Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>His message late in life is contrary to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying that violence is innate in man, &quot;forged in the substance of what, since <a href="Sigmund_Freud" title="wikilink">Freud</a>, we have called the <a href="id,_ego,_and_super-ego" title="wikilink">id</a>.&quot; Hughes believes that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of <a href="The_Dog_(Goya)" title="wikilink">Goya's dog</a>, &quot;whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Disasters of War</em> is preoccupied with wasted bodies, undifferentiated body parts, castration and female abjection. There are dark erotic undertones to a number of the works. Connell notes the innate sexuality of the image in plate 7&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Agustina_de_Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Agustina de Arag&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a>'s igniting a long cannon.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> The art historian Lennard Davis suggests that Goya was fascinated with the &quot;erotics of dismemberment&quot;,<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> while Hughes mentions <a href="commons:File:Disparates_10.jpg" title="wikilink">plate 10</a> in <em>Los disparates</em>, which shows a woman carried in the grip of a horse's mouth. To Hughes, the woman's euphoria suggests, among other possible meanings, orgasm.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, <em>The Disasters of War</em> had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's <a href="Real_Academia_de_Bellas_Artes_de_San_Fernando" title="wikilink">Royal Academy of San Fernando</a> in 1863.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-<a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore_G&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricault" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore G&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricault</a>,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> best known for the politically charged <em><a href="The_Raft_of_the_Medusa" title="wikilink">Raft of the Medusa</a></em> (1818&lt;U+2013&gt;19). <a href="Luis_Bu&lt;U+00F1&gt;uel" title="wikilink">Luis Bu&lt;U+00F1&gt;uel</a> identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as <em><a href="L&#39;&lt;U+00C2&gt;ge_d&#39;or" title="wikilink">L'&lt;U+00C2&gt;ge d'or</a></em> (1930), on which he collaborated with Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt;, and <em><a href="The_Exterminating_Angel_(film)" title="wikilink">The Exterminating Angel</a></em> (1962).<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn76">It has been suggested that Goya numbered the initial set of 56 plates in 1814, during a few months of national optimism following the end of the war, with the intent of publishing them then. However, on 11 May 1814, Fernando VII declared that the war would be forgotten and nullified the constitution, making publication impossible (Sayre, 128&lt;U+2013&gt;129).<a href="#fnref76" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn78">Licht speculates, &quot;These plates obviously had to be created by the artist without any further thought about their ultimate purpose. Goya never intended them for publication during his lifetime.&quot; (Licht, 128). Wilson-Bareau and Hughes disagree, see Wilson-Bareau p.59 and <em>passim</em> in chapter 4.<a href="#fnref78" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn79">The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937.<a href="http://www.spaightwoodgalleries.com/Pages/Goya_Desastres.html">Spaightwood Galleries</a> accessed October 18, 2009<a href="#fnref79" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn80">&quot;As midnight approached, my master said, 'Isidro, take your gun and come with me.' I obeyed him and where do you think we went?&lt;U+2014&gt;To that hill where the bodies of those poor people still lay .... My master opened his portfolio, put it on his lap and waited for the moon to come out from behind the large cloud that was hiding it .... At last the moon shone so brightly that it seemed like daylight. Amidst the pools of blood, we could make out some of the corpses&lt;U+2014&gt;some lying on their backs, others on their bellies; this one in a kneeling position, that one with his arms raised toward heaven, begging for vengeance or mercy .... While I stared at the terrible scene, filled with dread, my master drew it. We returned home and the next morning my master showed me his first print of <em>La Guerra</em>, which I looked at in horror. 'Sir,' I asked him, 'Why do you draw these barbarities which men commit?' He replied, 'To warn men not to be barbarians ever again.' &quot;Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente; Licht et al, 82&lt;U+2013&gt;83<a href="#fnref80" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn81">In a BBC television documentary, Glendinning said: &quot;Trueba is clearly romanticising the artist, making the artist fearless and heroic, I mean not to just observe through the spy glass these terrible things that are happening, but actually going to see them .... None of this corresponds at all to the reality of the shootings. Because we know the shootings took place at four or five o'clock in the morning. Some modern experts point out it was also raining, and so the idea that Goya is going out at midnight, he's not going to see anything. None of this fits with historical information we have.&quot; Glendinning also pointed out that Trueba places Goya in his house known as <em>Quinta del Sordo</em>. Goya moved into this house in 1819, after the war, casting further doubt on Trueba's version.
