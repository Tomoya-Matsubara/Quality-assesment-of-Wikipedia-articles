<p><strong>Robert James Ritchie</strong> (born January 17, 1971), known by his stage name <strong>Kid Rock</strong>, is an American singer-songwriter and <a href="rapper" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapper</a> with five <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> nominations. Kid Rock is known for music that incorporates elements of <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a>, <a href="rap_metal" title="wikilink">rap metal</a>, <a href="blues-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues-rock</a>, <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a>, <a href="southern_rock" title="wikilink">southern rock</a>, <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> and <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a>.</p>
<p>Kid Rock released several studio albums that mostly went unnoticed before his 1998 record <em><a href="Devil_Without_a_Cause" title="wikilink">Devil Without a Cause</a></em>, released with <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic Records</a>, sold 11 million albums behind the hits, &quot;<a href="Bawitdaba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bawitdaba</a>&quot;,&quot;<a href="Cowboy_(song)" title="wikilink">Cowboy</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="Only_God_Knows_Why" title="wikilink">Only God Knows Why</a>&quot;. In 2000, he released <em><a href="The_History_of_Rock" title="wikilink">The History of Rock</a></em> which was a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from his previous albums as well as the hit single, &quot;<a href="American_Bad_Ass" title="wikilink">American Bad Ass</a>&quot;. In 2001, he released the follow up, <em><a href="Cocky_(album)" title="wikilink">Cocky</a></em>. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit &quot;<a href="Picture_(song)" title="wikilink">Picture</a>&quot; with <a href="Sheryl_Crow" title="wikilink">Sheryl Crow</a> resurrected the album and it went gold as a single and pushed the album's sales to more than 5 million. It was followed by 2003's <a href="Kid_Rock_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled release</a>, which failed to chart a major hit. In 2006 he released <em><a href="Live_Trucker" title="wikilink">Live Trucker</a></em> , a live album. In 2007 Kid Rock released <em><a href="Rock_N_Roll_Jesus" title="wikilink">Rock N Roll Jesus</a></em>, which produced a hit in &quot;<a href="All_Summer_Long_(Kid_Rock_song)" title="wikilink">All Summer Long</a>.&quot; It was his first worldwide smash hit, charting #1 in eight countries across Europe and Australia.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Rock N Roll Jesus</em> would go on to sell 5 million albums worldwide including being certified triple platinum in the US.</p>

<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>Ritchie was born in <a href="Romeo,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Romeo, Michigan</a>. At age eleven he joined a <a href="breakdance" class="uri" title="wikilink">breakdance</a> crew (referred to as b-boy), called the Furious Funkers. They would dance anywhere they could for money. He saved up his money to buy a cheap belt-driven <a href="Phonograph" title="wikilink">turntable</a>, and he taught himself how to work the tables. In high school, Ritchie <a href="DJ" title="wikilink">DJed</a> at parties for beer. He eventually joined Bo Wisdom of Groove Time Productions, in <a href="Mt._Clemens,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Mt. Clemens, Michigan</a> to perform basement parties for thirty dollars a night. It was then that he was given his stage name; club goers dubbed him &quot;Kid Rock&quot; after they had enjoyed watching &quot;that white kid that can rock.&quot; Rock started <a href="rapping" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapping</a> and joined a local <a href="Hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> group, The Beast Crew. They were composed of The Blackman, Champtown, KDC, Crisp and Doc Rounce Cee. Rock became friends with producer <a href="D-Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">D-Nice</a> of the legendary hip-hop group <a href="Boogie_Down_Productions" title="wikilink">Boogie Down Productions</a>. When Rock opened for BDP one night, D-Nice invited an <a href="A&amp;R" class="uri" title="wikilink">A&amp;R</a> representative from <a href="Jive_Records" title="wikilink">Jive Records</a> to see him perform. This meeting led to a demo deal, which developed into a full record contract.</p>
<p>Against his parents' wishes, Rock signed the deal at the age of seventeen. Despite his new record deal, he had a falling out with The Beast Crew when he signed over fellow member Champtown (the two have become friends again since). They left his vocals on the tracks of their debut underground album &quot;Chapter 1: He Don't Want Us No More,&quot; against his wishes. Rock later became part of the Straight From The Underground Tour, where he found himself alongside several heavyweights of rap including <a href="Ice_Cube" title="wikilink">Ice Cube</a>, <a href="Too_Short" title="wikilink">Too Short</a>, D-Nice, Mac Dre, and <a href="Yo-Yo_(rapper)" title="wikilink">Yo-Yo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="independent-days-19911997">Independent days (1991–1997)</h3>
<p>In late 1991 he was picked up by an independent record label called Continuum Records, which released his second album <em><a href="The_Polyfuze_Method" title="wikilink">The Polyfuze Method</a></em> the following year. He moved to Brooklyn to work on the album. It was more rock oriented with Rock teaching himself how to play several different instruments including guitar, drums, keyboard and organ. While the album saw some local college radio success at <a href="Central_Michigan_University" title="wikilink">Central Michigan University</a> with the tracks &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; and &quot;Balls In Your Mouth&quot;, the lead single, &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot;, which failed to chart, and the music video received little airplay on any major music video channels. Kid Rock re-released &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; as a single to mainstream radio, but that too failed as a single. The album has sold around 100,000 copies.</p>
<p>He released an <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a> called <em><a href="Fire_It_Up_(EP)" title="wikilink">Fire It Up</a></em> later in 1993. The album was hard rock oriented, but he couldn't get rock radio to pick up on any of the singles, including &quot;<a href="I_Am_the_Bullgod" title="wikilink">I Am the Bullgod</a>&quot;, which would be a hit five years later. He was told that there was too much rapping in the songs. Continuum didn't see a future with Rock after this and released him from his contract in 1994.</p>
<p>He moved back to Detroit where his on-again/off-again relationship with Kelly South resulted in the birth of his son, Robert James Ritchie, Jr. Kid Rock has since acquired custody of his son. He started his own label, Top Dog Records, and released monthly demo tapes dubbed <em>The Bootleg Series</em>, which featured demos of him and other up-and-coming rappers and garage rock bands in the Detroit area. Around the same time, Kid Rock formed his back-up band <a href="Twisted_Brown_Trucker" title="wikilink">Twisted Brown Trucker</a>, later recruiting <a href="Joe_C." title="wikilink">Joe C.</a>, who he met at a 1994 concert, as part of the group. In 1995, Rock took a job as a janitor at Whiterooms Studios in order to pay studio fees. When he wasn't working, Kid Rock recorded the material that would eventually make up his fourth album, <em><a href="Early_Morning_Stoned_Pimp" title="wikilink">Early Morning Stoned Pimp</a></em>. During the recording process he met piano player Jimmie Bones, who was working with Robert Bradley in the adjacent room at White Room Studios. Bones decided to join Kid Rock's band soon after. The album was released January 9, 1996. A loan from his father aided the release. Kid Rock sold 60,000 copies out of the trunk of his car, including after his concerts. With EMSP local success he would re-release The Polyfuze Method as The Polyfuze Method Revisted in 1997 with &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot;, &quot;Rollin On The Island&quot; and &quot;Rain Check&quot; as additional tracks in March 1997.</p>
<p>While Kid Rock was now popular in Michigan and controlling his own label, he felt he needed to get attention from a major label. He was unaware that in December 1996, Lava/Atlantic Records A&amp;R man Andy Karp traveled to Cleveland to see Rock perform at a small club called The Grog Shop. This was key, because on March 30, 1997, Rock performed a special showcase concert to attract major label attention. While many of the major labels were invited, the only attendees were Karp and Lava President Jason Flom (Lava/Atlantic Records), who had seen him in Cleveland. Following the performance, record executives said they loved him but expressed doubts about the strength of his material. Kid Rock returned to the studio and cut a six song demo tape. The first two songs on the tape were &quot;Somebody's Gotta Feel This&quot; and &quot;I Got One For Ya&quot;. After hearing the two songs, <a href="Jason_Flom" title="wikilink">Jason Flom</a> supported Karp in signing Kid Rock to a record deal for $100,000, without even hearing the rest of the material.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="devil-without-a-cause-19972000"><em>Devil Without a Cause</em> (1997–2000)</h3>
<p>In 1997, Kid Rock added drummer/vocalist <a href="Stefanie_Eulinberg" title="wikilink">Stefanie Eulinberg</a> to his band, joining <a href="Kenny_Olson" title="wikilink">Kenny Olson</a>, <a href="Jason_Krause" title="wikilink">Jason Krause</a>, Jimmie Bones, <a href="Uncle_Kracker" title="wikilink">Uncle Kracker</a>, Misty Love, Shirley Hayden and <a href="Joe_C." title="wikilink">Joe C.</a>. On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released <em><a href="Devil_Without_a_Cause" title="wikilink">Devil Without a Cause</a></em> behind the single &quot;Welcome 2 The Party.&quot; Kid Rock went on the <a href="Warped_Tour" title="wikilink">Vans Warped Tour</a> to support the album, performing one of his first New York City shows at Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side during the CMJ convention.</p>
<p>Audiences ignored &quot;Welcome 2 The Party&quot; and <em>Devil</em> sat on the shelves collecting dust for eight months. While sales nationwide lagged, his performance on the 1998 Warped Tour in <a href="Northampton,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Northampton, Massachusetts</a> stimulated regional interest in <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>. This led to substantial airplay in the summer and fall of 1998 on rock staples in Massachusetts <a href="WZLX" class="uri" title="wikilink">WZLX</a> and <a href="WAAF_(FM)" title="wikilink">WAAF</a> for the single &quot;I Am The Bullgod.&quot; In December 1998, while dj'ing at a club he met and became friends with MTV host <a href="Carson_Daly" title="wikilink">Carson Daly</a>, he got an offer to perform on <em>MTV Fashionably Loud</em> in Miami, giving the nation its first real look at Kid Rock. From there, MTV took him under their wing as he performed on MTV's <em>Wanna B A VJ</em> doing &quot;My Name Is Rock&quot; and was the DJ for <em>TRL</em> on the Spring Break Special as well as a judge on <em>Say What Karaoke</em>. This sparked him to gold status by April 1999.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1999, he released the song &quot;<a href="Bawitdaba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bawitdaba</a>&quot; to radio outlets, and proceeded to blow up overnight. By June, the album had gone platinum.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Kid Rock went on the Limptropolis Tour with fellow rap-rockers <a href="Limp_Bizkit" title="wikilink">Limp Bizkit</a> and <a href="Staind" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staind</a> in the same month, his first major tour. By the time he made his career defining performance at <a href="Woodstock_1999" title="wikilink">Woodstock 1999</a> on July 27, 1999, he was double platinum.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The following single &quot;<a href="Cowboy_(Kid_Rock_song)" title="wikilink">Cowboy</a>&quot; was an even bigger hit. It was a unique mix of southern rock, country and rap that found its way into the Top 40. Kid Rock helped create one of the most memorable moments in MTV history with his 1999 Video Music Awards medley with <a href="Run-D.M.C." class="uri" title="wikilink">Run-D.M.C.</a> and <a href="Aerosmith" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aerosmith</a> who rejoined to perform the seminal rap-rock version of &quot;<a href="Walk_This_Way" title="wikilink">Walk This Way</a>,&quot; the same song that revived Aerosmith's career in the 1980s. Rock's next single, the rock ballad &quot;<a href="Only_God_Knows_Why" title="wikilink">Only God Knows Why</a>,&quot; would be the biggest hit off the album charting at No 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. By the time the final single &quot;<a href="Wasting_Time_(Kid_Rock_Song)" title="wikilink">Wasting Time</a>&quot; was released the album had sold 7 million albums, <em>Devil Without A Cause</em> was certified 11 times platinum by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">RIAA</a> on April 17, 2003.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

He performed the song in Vancouver Canada on Monday Night Raw on May 29, 2000. During the show Joe C helped Too Cool win the tag team titles from Edge and Christian who had mocked him for being a midget. Edge and Christian got their revenge by stuffing him in a trash can and slamming him into the wall afterwards. The following night Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett of Metallica joined Kid Rock to do &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; on <em>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</em>.</p>
<p>From June 30 to August 22, 2000, Rock joined the <a href="Summer_Sanitarium_Tour" title="wikilink">Summer Sanitarium Tour</a> with Metallica, <a href="Korn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korn</a>, <a href="Powerman_5000" title="wikilink">Powerman 5000</a>, and <a href="System_of_a_Down" title="wikilink">System of a Down</a>.

Kid Rock was referred to as Kidney Rock to go along with the cartoon aspect of being a cell in the body of Frank played by Bill Murray.</p>

<p>In November, Kid Rock released <em><a href="Cocky_(album)" title="wikilink">Cocky</a></em>, which was marketed as the official follow up to <em>Devil Without a Cause</em>. With the era of rap metal on the decline, Kid Rock included several southern rock and country ballads on the album.
