<p><img src="Straunie.jpg" title="fig:Helliar in character as Bryan Strauchan" alt="Helliar in character as Bryan Strauchan" /> From the 2005 AFL season, Peter created an <a href="alter_ego" title="wikilink">alter ego</a> called <a href="Bryan_Strauchan" title="wikilink">Bryan Strauchan</a> which initially debuted on <em>Before the Game</em>. Bryan Strauchan is supposedly the last pick in the 2004 AFL National Draft, yet to get a game for his new club <a href="Collingwood_Football_Club" title="wikilink">Collingwood Football Club</a> (Peter is a big Collingwood supporter). For the role, Helliar dons a blonde <a href="mullet_(hairstyle)" title="wikilink">mullet</a> wig as a stereotypical Australian <a href="bogan" class="uri" title="wikilink">bogan</a> footy player &quot;wannabee&quot;. The comedy is achieved by self effacing humour, puting Bryan in situations that highlight his weight, lack of fitness and general inability whilst his egotistical personality and allusions of grandeur means he is completely unaware of these things. Since the character has experienced raised popularity and profile, and is arguably become bigger celebrity than Peter Helliar, <em>Strauchnie</em> has made several subsequent appearances across different media. Helliar is currently considering releasing a new movie based on the character planned for release in 2010.</p>
