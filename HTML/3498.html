<p>During the <a href="3rd_millennium_BC" title="wikilink">third millennium BC</a>, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread <a href="wikt:bilingualism" title="wikilink">bilingualism</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The influence of <a href="Sumerian_language" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> on <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a <em><a href="Sprachbund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sprachbund</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a> somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">AD</a>.</p>
<p>Through linguistic assimilation, Akkad gave its name to the predominant <a href="Semitic_language" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> dialect: the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian language</a> of <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>, reflecting use of <em>akkad&lt;U+00FB&gt;</em> (&quot;in the language of Akkad&quot;) in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a <a href="Sumerian_language" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> text. Akkadian was also the language of <a href="Babylonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babylonia</a>, <a href="Assyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assyria</a>, <a href="Mari,_Syria" title="wikilink">Mari</a> and <a href="Eshnunna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eshnunna</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-city-of-akkad">The city of Akkad</h2>
<p>The precise archaeological site of the city of Akkad has, at present, not been found. The form <em>Agade</em> appears in Sumerian, for example in the <a href="Sumerian_King_List" title="wikilink">Sumerian King List</a>; the later Assyro-Babylonian form <em>Akkad&lt;U+00FB&gt;</em> (&quot;of or belonging to Akkad&quot;) was likely derived from this. It is possible that the Sumerian name, despite its unetymological spelling <em>A.GA.D&lt;U+00C8&gt;</em>, is from <em>AGA.D&lt;U+00C8&gt;</em>, meaning &quot;Crown of Fire&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> in allusion to <a href="Ishtar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ishtar</a>, &quot;the brilliant goddess&quot;, whose cult was observed from very early times in Agade. Centuries later, the neo-Babylonian king <a href="Nabonidus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nabonidus</a> mentioned in his archaeological records<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> that Ishtar's worship in Agade was later superseded by that of the goddess <a href="Anunit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anunit</a>, whose shrine was at <a href="Sippar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sippar</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;suggesting proximity of Sippar and Agade.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Despite numerous searches, the city has never been found. One theory holds that Agade was situated opposite Sippar on the left bank of the Euphrates, and was perhaps the oldest part of the city of Sippar. Another theory is that the ruins of Akkad are to be found beneath modern <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>. Reputedly it was destroyed by invading <a href="Gutians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gutians</a> with the fall of the Akkadian Empire.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p><a href="Semitic_languages" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> speakers seem to have already been present in Mesopotamia at the dawn of the historical record, and soon achieved preeminence with the first Dynasty of <a href="Kish_(Sumer)" title="wikilink">Kish</a> and numerous localities to the north of Sumer, where rulers with Semitic names had already established themselves by the 3rd millennium BC.</p>
<p>Sargon has often been cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, although more recently discovered data suggests there had been Sumerian expansions under previous kings, including <a href="Lugal-Anne-Mundu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugal-Anne-Mundu</a> of <a href="Adab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adab</a>, <a href="Eannatum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eannatum</a> of <a href="Lagash" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lagash</a>, and <a href="Lugal-Zage-Si" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugal-Zage-Si</a>.</p>
<h4 id="sargon-and-his-sons">Sargon and his sons</h4>

<p><img src="Sargon_of_Akkad.jpg" title="fig:Bronze head of an Akkadian \, (National Museum of Iraq)" alt="Bronze head of an Akkadian \, (National Museum of Iraq)" width="130" /> The fame of the early establishers of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that of <a href="Sargon_of_Akkad" title="wikilink">Sargon of Akkad</a> (<em>Sharru-kin</em> = &quot;legitimate king&quot;, probably a title he took on gaining power)<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> (23rd century BCE), who defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si, conquering his empire.</p>
<p>The earliest records in the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian language</a> all date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a <a href="hierodule" class="uri" title="wikilink">hierodule</a>, prostitute, or <a href="priest" title="wikilink">priestess</a> to <a href="Ishtar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ishtar</a> or <a href="Inanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inanna</a>.</p>
<p>One legend related of Sargon in neo-Assyrian times says that </p>
<p>Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, <a href="Ur-Zababa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ur-Zababa</a>, Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, the crown was set upon Sargon's head, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Four times he invaded <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> and <a href="Canaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canaan</a>, and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached as far as the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Sea</a> and <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a>, and extending his rule to <a href="Elam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elam</a>, and as far south as <a href="Magan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magan</a> (<a href="Oman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oman</a>), an area over which he reigned for 56 years. Trade extended from the <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a> mines of Anatolia to the <a href="lapis_lazuli" title="wikilink">lapis lazuli</a> mines in <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>, the <a href="Cedrus_libani" title="wikilink">cedars</a> of <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> and the <a href="copper" class="uri" title="wikilink">copper</a> of Oman. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.</p>
<p>Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia (<a href="Subartu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subartu</a>) were also subjugated and rebellions in Sumer were put down. <a href="Contract" class="uri" title="wikilink">Contract</a> tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of <a href="Gutian_period" title="wikilink">Gutium</a>.</p>
<p>Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly Inanna, his patroness, and Zababa, the warrior god of Kish. He called himself <em>&quot;The anointed priest of <a href="Anu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anu</a>&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;the great</em> <strong><a href="ENSI" title="wikilink">ensi</a></strong> <em>of <a href="Enlil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enlil</a>&quot;</em> and his daughter, <a href="Enheduanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enheduanna</a> the famous poet, was installed as priestess to <a href="Nanna_(Sumerian_deity)" title="wikilink">Nanna</a> at the temple in <a href="Ur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ur</a>.</p>
<p>He also boasted of having subjugated the &quot;four quarters&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Subartu), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam) and the west (<a href="Amorites" title="wikilink">Martu</a>). Some of the earliest texts credit him with rebuilding the city of Babylon (<em>Bab-ilu</em>) in a new location. More recently, some researchers have stated that those sources may refer to <a href="Sargon_II" title="wikilink">Sargon II</a> of the <a href="Neo-Assyrian_Empire" title="wikilink">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a> rather than Sargon of Akkad.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states</p>

<p>Also shortly after,</p>

<p>These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons. Revolts broke out during the 9-year reign of his son, <a href="Rimush_(Akkad)" title="wikilink">Rimush</a>, who fought hard to retain the empire&lt;U+2014&gt;and in the fifteen year reign of Rimush's elder brother, <a href="Manishtushu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manishtushu</a>. The latter king seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him. Both appear to have been assassinated.</p>
<h4 id="naram-sin">Naram-Sin</h4>
<p><img src="Stele_Naram_Sim_Louvre_Sb4.jpg" title="fig:Stele of Naram-Sin, king of Akkad, celebrating his victory against the Lullubi from Zagros in Iran. c. 4260 BP." alt="Stele of Naram-Sin, king of Akkad, celebrating his victory against the Lullubi from Zagros in Iran. c. 4260 BP." /> <a href="Naram-Suen_of_Akkad" title="wikilink">Naram-Suen</a> (Beloved of <a href="Suen" title="wikilink">Sin</a>), Sargon's grandson, who assumed the imperial title of &quot;King Naram-Sin, of the four quarters (<em>Lugal Naram-S&lt;U+00EE&gt;n, &lt;U+0160&gt;ar kibrat 'arbaim</em>)&quot;, and, like his grandfather, was addressed as &quot;the god (Sumerian = DINGIR, Akkadian = <em>ilu</em>) of Agade&quot; (Akkad), also faced revolts at the start of his reign.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of <a href="Ebla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ebla</a> as well as Armani and its king. Armanum was located on the Euphrates River between Elba and Nagar (Tell Brak), most likely at the Citadel of Bazi - Tall Banat complex.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> To better police this area, he built a royal residence at <a href="Tell_Brak" title="wikilink">Tell Brak</a>, a crossroads at the heart of the <a href="Khabur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khabur</a> basin of the <a href="Jezirah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jezirah</a>. Naram-Suen is supposed to have possessed an army of over 360,000 men, the largest size of any state up until that date. It enabled him to campaign against <em><a href="Magan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magan</a></em> (thought to be on the Arabian peninsula) which also revolted; Naram-Sin, <em>&quot;marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king&quot;</em>. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northeastern mountaineers. A campaign against the <a href="Lullubi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lullubi</a> led to the carving of the famous &quot;Victory Stele of Naram-Suen&quot;, now in the <a href="Louvre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvre</a>. This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="Naram-Sin_inscription_AO6782_stitched.jpg" title="fig:Inscription of Naram Sin found at the city of Marad in Iraq. c. 4260 BP." alt="Inscription of Naram Sin found at the city of Marad in Iraq. c. 4260 BP." /> The economy was highly planned. After the advancing Akkadian forces from <a href="Tell_Brak" title="wikilink">Tell Brak</a> took the massive (100 acre) site of <a href="Tell_Leilan" title="wikilink">Tell Leilan</a>, they destroyed nearby villages and brought the organization of farming and grain distribution into its bureaucratic control. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In later Babylonian texts, the name <em>Akkad</em>, together with <em>Sumer</em>, appears as part of the royal title, as in the <a href="Sumerian_language" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> <a href="LUGAL" class="uri" title="wikilink">LUGAL</a> KI.EN.GIR<sup>KI</sup> URU<sup>KI</sup> or <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> <em>&lt;U+0160&gt;ar m&lt;U+0101&gt;t &lt;U+0160&gt;umeri u Akkadi</em>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> translating to &quot;king of <a href="Sumer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumer</a> and Akkad&quot;. This title was assumed by the king who seized control of <a href="Nippur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nippur</a>,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> the intellectual and religious center of southern <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>.</p>
<p>During the Akkadian period, the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian language</a> became the <a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a> of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the <a href="Sumerian_language" title="wikilink">Sumerian language</a> remained as a literary language. The spread of Akkadian stretched from Syria to Elam, and even the <a href="Elamite_language" title="wikilink">Elamite language</a> was temporarily written in Mesopotamian <a href="cuneiform" class="uri" title="wikilink">cuneiform</a>. Akkadian texts later found their way to far-off places, from <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> (in the <a href="Amarna_Period" title="wikilink">Amarna Period</a>) and Anatolia, to <a href="Persia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persia</a> (<a href="Behistun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Behistun</a>).</p>
<h3 id="collapse-of-the-akkadian-empire">Collapse of the Akkadian Empire</h3>
<p>Within 100 years the Empire of Akkad collapsed almost as fast as it had developed, ushering in a period of regional decline which lasted until the rise of the <a href="Third_Dynasty_of_Ur" title="wikilink">Third Dynasty of Ur</a>. By the end of the reign of Naram-Sin's son, <a href="Shar-kali-sharri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shar-kali-sharri</a>, the empire had weakened collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarians known as &quot;<a href="Gutian_period" title="wikilink">Gutians</a>&quot; during the reign of Shu-Durul. It has recently been suggested that the regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period (and <a href="First_Intermediary_Period" title="wikilink">First Intermediary Period</a> of the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="Old_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Old Kingdom</a>) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East, caused by a <a href="4.2_kiloyear_event" title="wikilink">global centennial-scale drought</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the Gutian period. From the fall of Akkad ca. 2083 BC until the <a href="Sumerian_renaissance" title="wikilink">Sumerian renaissance</a> ca. 2050 BC, there is much that is still dark.</p>
<p>The <a href="Sumerian_King_List" title="wikilink">Sumerian King List</a>, describing the Akkadian Empire after the death of Shar-kali-shari, states:</p>

<p>These kings of Uruk may have been contemporaries of the last kings of Akkad.</p>

<p>Evidence from <a href="Tell_Leilan" title="wikilink">Tell Leilan</a> in Northern Mesopotamia shows what may have happened. The site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. Nomadic herders such as the <a href="Amorite" title="wikilink">Amorites</a> moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with farmers. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>This collapse of rain-fed agriculture in &quot;the Upper Country&quot; meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a  wall known as the &quot;Repeller of the Amorites&quot; between the Tigris and Euphrates under the neo-Sumerian ruler <a href="Shu-Suen" title="wikilink">Shu-Sin</a>. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depopulation occurred to re-establish <a href="Demography" title="wikilink">demographic equilibrium</a> with the less favorable climatic conditions.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>It has also been suggested (Burroughs, 2008) that the rapid climatic collapse, marking the Akkadian Dark Age, may have been responsible for the religiously prescribed prohibition against the raising and consumption of <a href="pig" title="wikilink">pigs</a> that spread through the Ancient Middle East from the end of the third millennium BC.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The period between ca. 2050 BC and 1940 BC is known as the <a href="Ur_III_period" title="wikilink">Third dynasty of Ur</a> or &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot;, founded by <a href="Ur-Namma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ur-Namma</a> (originally a general). Documents again began to be written in Sumerian, although Sumerian was becoming a purely literary or liturgical language, much as Latin later would be in <a href="Medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medieval</a> <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the Akkadian people of Mesopotamia eventually founded new kingdoms, the most notable of these being <a href="Babylonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babylonia</a> and <a href="Assyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assyria</a>, both of whom would ensure the continuity of Sumero-Akkadian culture.</p>
<h3 id="the-curse">The Curse</h3>
<p>Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Naram-Suen's attack upon the city of <a href="Nippur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nippur</a>. When prompted by a pair of inauspicious <a href="oracle" title="wikilink">oracles</a>, the king sacked the <a href="E_(temple)" title="wikilink">E</a>-kur temple, supposedly protected by the god <a href="Enlil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enlil</a>, head of the <a href="Pantheon_(gods)" title="wikilink">pantheon</a>. As a result of this, eight chief deities of the <a href="Anunnaki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anunnaki</a> pantheon were supposed to have come together and withdrawn their support from Akkad.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>For many years, the events described in &quot;The Curse of Akkad&quot; were thought, like the details of Sargon's birth, to be purely fictional. But now the evidence of <a href="Tell_Leilan" title="wikilink">Tell Leilan</a>, and recent findings of elevated dust deposits in sea-cores collected off Oman, that date to the period of Akkad's collapse suggest that <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> may have played a role.</p>
<h2 id="government">Government</h2>
<p>The Akkadian government formed a &quot;classical standard&quot; with which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally, the <em>ensi</em> was the highest functionary of the <a href="Sumer" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> <a href="city-state" title="wikilink">city-states</a>. In later traditions, one became an <em>ensi</em> by marrying the goddess <a href="Inanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inanna</a>, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.</p>
<p>Initially, the monarchical <em>lugal</em> (<em>lu</em> = man, <em>gal</em> = great) was subordinate to the priestly <em>ensi</em>, and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the <em>lugal</em> who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own <em>&quot;&lt;U+00E9&gt;&quot;</em> (= house) or &quot;palace&quot;, independent from the temple establishment. By the time of <a href="Mesalim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesalim</a>, whichever dynasty controlled the city of <a href="Kish_(Sumer)" title="wikilink">Kish</a> was recognised as <em>&lt;U+0161&gt;ar ki&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt;ati</em> (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.</p>
<p>As Sargon extended his conquest from the &quot;Lower Sea&quot; (Persian Gulf), to the &quot;Upper Sea&quot; (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled &quot;the totality of the lands under heaven&quot;, or &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot;, as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the <em>ensi</em>s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title <em>&lt;U+0161&gt;ar ki&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt;ati</em> became recognised as meaning &quot;lord of the universe&quot;. Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to <a href="Dilmun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dilmun</a> (<a href="Bahrein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahrein</a>) and <a href="Magan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magan</a> (possibly <a href="Oman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oman</a>), amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history. Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of <a href="Keftiu" title="wikilink">Kaptara</a> (possibly <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a>), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.</p>
<p>With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called &quot;Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)&quot;, but also elevated to the ranks of the <em>dingir</em> (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like <a href="Gilgamesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gilgamesh</a>, become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, <a href="Enheduanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enheduanna</a> and <a href="Enmenanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enmenanna</a> respectively, as high <a href="priest" title="wikilink">priestess</a> to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, <a href="Nanna_(Sumerian_deity)" title="wikilink">Nanna</a>, at <a href="Ur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ur</a>, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial <em>ensi</em> governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire (<a href="Urkesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urkesh</a> and Marhashe). A well documented case of the later is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>The population of Akkad, like all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centres: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as <em>&quot;the Upper Country&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Southern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than  per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Prior to the Akkadian period the progressive <a href="salinity" title="wikilink">salinisation</a> of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of <a href="wheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">wheat</a> in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant <a href="barley" class="uri" title="wikilink">barley</a> growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and ecological pressures were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately prior to the Akkadian period (as seen in the stele of the vultures of <a href="Eannatum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eannatum</a>). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.</p>
<p>The <a href="water_table" title="wikilink">water table</a> in this region was very high, and replenished regularly&lt;U+2014&gt;by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March, and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October&lt;U+2014&gt;a period of food shortage&lt;U+2014&gt;under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Some have suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of <a href="Kish_(Sumer)" title="wikilink">Kish</a>, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, <em>&quot;Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival&lt;U+2014&gt;5,400 warriors ate bread daily before him&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Murex_Rimush_Louvre_AO21404.jpg" title="fig:Murex bearing the name of Rimush, king of Kish, ca. 2270 BC, Louvre, traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by Canaanites to make a purple dye" alt="Murex bearing the name of Rimush, king of Kish, ca. 2270 BC, Louvre, traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by Canaanites to make a purple dye" /> Harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic <a href="Amurru" title="wikilink">Martu</a> (<a href="Amorites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amorites</a>) from the northwest would pasture their flocks of <a href="sheep" class="uri" title="wikilink">sheep</a> and <a href="goat" title="wikilink">goats</a> to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.</p>
<p>As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products, but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the &quot;silver mountain&quot;, the &quot;cedars&quot; of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of <a href="Magan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magan</a> (modern <a href="Oman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oman</a>), was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports. One tablet reads <em>&quot;Sargon, the king of <a href="Kish_(Sumer)" title="wikilink">Kish</a>, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from <a href="Meluhha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meluhha</a> (the <a href="Indus_civilization" title="wikilink">Indus civilization</a>), the ships from <a href="Magan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magan</a> (and) the ships from <a href="Dilmun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dilmun</a> (<a href="Bahrein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahrein</a>) tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon the king prostrated himself before (the god) <a href="Dagan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dagan</a> (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, namely <a href="Mari,_Syria" title="wikilink">Mari</a>, <a href="Yarmuti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yarmuti</a>, (and) <a href="Ebla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ebla</a>, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain&quot;.</em></p>
<p>[The location of the &quot;Silver Mountain&quot; is uncertain, but it is believed to have been in the <a href="Taurus_Mountains" title="wikilink">Taurus Mountains</a>, in southern <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a>.]</p>
<p>Inscriptions from much later tell of a campaign as far as <a href="Purushkanda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purushkanda</a>, believed to have been on one of the tributaries of <a href="Lake_Bey&lt;U+015F&gt;ehir" title="wikilink">Lake Bey&lt;U+015F&gt;ehir</a>. The same inscription tells of securing the trade from Kaptara, believed to be the Akkadian name for the location known to Egyptians as <em><a href="Keftiu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keftiu</a></em>, probably either <a href="Cyprus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyprus</a> or the <a href="Minoan_civilisation" title="wikilink">Minoan civilisation</a> of <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, or both.</p>

<p>A <em>bas relief</em> representing Naram-Sin, and bearing a striking resemblance to early <a href="Art_of_ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian art</a> in many of its features, has been found at <a href="Diyarbak&lt;U+0131&gt;r" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diyarbak&lt;U+0131&gt;r</a>, in modern <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. <a href="Art_and_architecture_of_Babylonia_and_Assyria" title="wikilink">Babylonian art</a>, however, had already attained a high degree of excellence; two <a href="cylinder_seal" title="wikilink">cylinder seals</a> of the time of Sargon are among the most beautiful specimens of the <a href="engraved_gems" title="wikilink">gem-cutter's art</a> ever discovered.</p>
<h3 id="poet---priestess-enheduanna">Poet - priestess Enheduanna</h3>
<p><a href="Sumer" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a> <a href="literature" class="uri" title="wikilink">literature</a> continued in rich development during the Akkadian period (a notable example being <a href="Enheduanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enheduanna</a>). Enheduanna, the &quot;wife (Sumerian <em>&quot;dam&quot;</em> = high priestess) of <a href="Nanna_(Norse_deity)" title="wikilink">Nanna</a> [the Sumerian moon god] and daughter of Sargon&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> of the temple of Sin at Ur, who lived ca. 2285-2250 BC, is the first <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a> in history whom we know by name. Her known works include hymns to the goddess <a href="Inanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inanna</a>, the <em>Exaltation of Inanna</em> and <em>In-nin sa-gur-ra</em>. A third work, the <em>Temple Hymns</em>, a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poetess are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poetess, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, according to William W Hallo, &quot;set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <em>Exultation of Inanna</em>,</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;Enheduanna depicts Inanna as disciplining mankind as a goddess of battle. She thereby unites the warlike Akkadian <a href="Ishtar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ishtar</a>'s qualities to those of the gentler Sumerian goddess of love and fecundity. She likens Inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats. Then, in probably the most interesting part of the hymn, Enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories, establishing her credibility, and explaining her present plight. She has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of Ur and from <a href="Uruk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruk</a> and exiled to the steppe. She begs the moon god Nanna to intercede for her because the city of <a href="Uruk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruk</a>, under the ruler Lugalanne, has rebelled against Sargon. The rebel, Lugalanne, has even destroyed the temple Eanna, one of the greatest temples in the ancient world. Further, he has dared to equate himself as an equal to the new high priestess and--in the most ancient recorded instant of sexual harassment--made sexual advances to the high priestess, his sister-in-law.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>

<p>One tablet from this period reads, <em>&quot;(From the earliest days) no-one had made a statue of lead, (but) Rimush king of Kish, had a statue of himself made of lead. It stood before <a href="Enlil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Enlil</a>; and it recited his (Rimush's) virtues to the idu of the gods&quot;</em>. Akkadian artists also discovered the <em>&quot;<a href="lost_wax" title="wikilink">lost wax</a>&quot;</em> method of <a href="bronze_casting" title="wikilink">bronze casting</a>, previously believed to have been discovered much later, at the time of <a href="classical_Greece" title="wikilink">classical Greece</a>.</p>
<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>
<p>The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular <a href="mail" title="wikilink">postal service</a>. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A <a href="cadastral" class="uri" title="wikilink">cadastral</a> survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his <a href="Canaan" title="wikilink">Canaanite</a> origin, was governor of the land of the <a href="Amorites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amorites</a>, or <em>Amurru</em> as the semi-<a href="nomad" title="wikilink">nomadic</a> people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of <a href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomical</a> observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The <em>&quot;<a href="limmu" class="uri" title="wikilink">limmu</a>&quot;</em> calendrical system, used henceforth in Mesopotamian history, whereby which years were named by one significant event, and these were listed, also began in the Akkadian period.</p>
<h2 id="in-popular-culture">In popular culture</h2>
<p>Popular interest in this ancient culture has been revived thanks in part to the 2002 motion picture release, <a href="The_Scorpion_King" title="wikilink">The Scorpion King</a>, starring <a href="Dwayne_Johnson" title="wikilink">Dwayne Johnson</a> as the Akkadian mercenary <a href="Mathayus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mathayus</a> who later becomes king.

A prequel titled <a href="The_Scorpion_King_2:_Rise_of_a_Warrior" title="wikilink">The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior</a> starring <a href="Michael_Copon" title="wikilink">Michael Copon</a> as young Mathayus, was released to DVD on August 19, 2008.</p>
