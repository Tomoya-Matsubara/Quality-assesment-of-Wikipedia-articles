<p><img src="ESC_2007_Russia_-_Serebro_-_Song_No_1.jpg" title="fig:Serebro performs &quot;Song#1&quot; on Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki." alt="Serebro performs &quot;Song#1&quot; on Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki." width="300" /> In late March 2007, the jury commission of Russian national TV channel &lt;U+2014&gt; Channel One were choosing Russia's representatives for the <a href="Eurovision_Song_Contest_2007" title="wikilink">Eurovision Song Contest 2007</a>. To everyone's surprise, the commission choose a fully unknown band named Serebro, which managed to overcome some famous native artists. In the <a href="Eurovision_Song_Contest_2006" title="wikilink">Eurovision Song Contest 2006</a>, <a href="Dima_Bilan" title="wikilink">Dima Bilan</a> with his song &quot;<a href="Never_Let_You_Go_(Dima_Bilan_song)" title="wikilink">Never Let You Go</a>&quot; reached the second place which automatically allowed Serebro to perform in the 2007 final.</p>
<p>On the 12th of May, Serebro performed as number 15 in the final. They got 12 points from <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a>, <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>, and <a href="Estonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonia</a> and 10 points from <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>. The winner, <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, gave them 7 points. Serebro received third place at the <a href="Eurovision_Song_Contest_2007#Final" title="wikilink">Eurovision Song Contest 2007</a>, with a total of 207 points. Serebro later said: &quot;We are happy because of our third place. But, the most important thing is that we weren't there because of ourselves, it was for our fans, Russia and Russian people&quot;. The performance in <a href="Helsinki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helsinki</a> became their first official release and first concert for an audience.</p>
<h3 id="u20142008-opiumroz">2007&lt;U+2014&gt;2008: <em>Opiumroz</em></h3>
<p>After the success at <a href="Eurovision_Song_Contest_2007" title="wikilink">Eurovision Song Contest 2007</a> in <a href="Helsinki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helsinki</a>, Serebro rapidly became one of the most popular bands in Russia. Since Summer 2007, the group has visited various concerts and events in Russia, <a href="Kazakhstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kazakhstan</a>, Turkey, Poland, <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, and <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>. All band singles, without their real titles, are named Song#1, #2, #3, etc. As the group and their management have stated, so it will be easier to recall their songs.</p>
<p>Soon after the Eurovision contest, Serebro released &quot;<a href="Song_Number_1" title="wikilink">Song #1</a>&quot; as a single CD, which contained 13 different versions of &quot;Song #1&quot; marked by colours, as well as an extended version of the video. The girls then released a Russian version of &quot;Song #1&quot;, called &quot;<a href="Song_Number_1#&lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt;#1" title="wikilink">&lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt; #1</a>&quot;. It was Serebro's first Russian single. This song has two versions, original and censored. In July 2007, the group released their second song, &quot;<a href="Dyshi" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0414&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0448&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;</a>&quot;, which is also titled &quot;Song #2&quot;. It became as popular as &quot;<a href="Song_Number_1" title="wikilink">Song#1</a>&quot; and climbed up to the top of the chart. Later in October, a video for &quot;<a href="Dyshi" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0414&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0448&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;</a>&quot; was released.</p>
<p>At the <a href="MTV_Russian_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">RMA awards</a> in early October 2007, Serebro performed a new song titled &quot;What's Your Problem?&quot;, which is still unconfirmed as an official single and the song number of it is still unknown. Serebro was nominated in four categories at the <a href="MTV_Russian_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV RMA 2007 awards</a>: Best Pop-project, Best Debut, Best Song and Best Video. The voting results on the <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> allowed them to win the award for Best Debut. In December 2007, Serebro won another award at the <em>Golden Gramophone</em> Awards, a big music award ceremony organized by the biggest radio broadcaster in Russia, <a href="CIS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CIS</a>. Serebro also won a <a href="World_Music_Award" title="wikilink">World Music Award</a> in 2007 for the best selling Russian artist. Unlike previous eastern European winners of a World Music Award (e.g. <a href="Ruslana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruslana</a> from <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a> in 2004 and <a href="Dima_Bilan" title="wikilink">Dima Bilan</a> for Russia in 2006), Serebro did not perform at the event.</p>
<p>In late February, Serebro performed &quot;<a href="Zhuravli" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0416&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;</a>&quot; on <em><a href="Zvezda_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0417&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+044D&gt;&lt;U+0437&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;</a></em>, a popular television programme in Russia, featuring artists singing patriotic songs. Originally written as a poem by <a href="Rasul_Gamzatov" title="wikilink">Rasul Gamzatov</a> &quot;&lt;U+0416&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; is one of the most famous Russian songs coming out of World War II. On May 13, 2008 Serebro announced on their official website that they will be releasing their third official single, called &quot;<a href="Opium_(Serebro_song)" title="wikilink">&lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;</a>&quot;. The song premiered on a Russian morning radio show <em>BrigadaU</em> on <a href="Europa_Plus" title="wikilink">Europa Plus</a> radio and until March 17, 2008 Europa Plus held exclusive rights to play the song. The girls also announced an English version of &quot;&lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&quot; titled &quot;Why&quot;.</p>
