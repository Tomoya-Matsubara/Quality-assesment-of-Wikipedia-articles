<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<h3 id="conception">Conception</h3>
<p>The idea for the series first came from executive producer <a href="Joel_Surnow" title="wikilink">Joel Surnow</a>, who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season. Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He discussed the idea over the phone with producer <a href="Robert_Cochran_(TV_producer)" title="wikilink">Robert Cochran</a>, whose initial response was &quot;Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> They met the next day at the <a href="International_House_of_Pancakes" title="wikilink">International House of Pancakes</a> in <a href="Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Woodland Hills, Los Angeles</a>, to discuss the idea of this action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The pilot for <em>24</em> was pitched to Fox who immediately bought it, saying they felt that the idea for the series was one that would &quot;move the form of television forward&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The episode had a $4 million budget with filming in March 2001, mostly done in an old Chatsworth pencil factory. The set of CTU was initially done in a Fox Sports office, with the set reproduced once the series was picked up for the season.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The series was supposed to be filmed in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, but due to the variability of Canadian weather, Los Angeles was chosen as a filming location.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The pilot of the series had been well received by critics, and was signed on for an initial thirteen episodes. Production began in July 2001, and the premiere was planned for October 30, but because of the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a>, delayed until November 6.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> After the first three episodes, Fox greenlit the remaining filmed 11 episodes and following <a href="Kiefer_Sutherland" title="wikilink">Kiefer Sutherland</a>'s <a href="Golden_Globe" title="wikilink">Golden Globe</a> win, Fox ordered the second half of the season.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

In the image, it shows several different people, in different locations, depicted at the same time. This is used to show the viewer what different characters are doing at the same time" width="250" /> The idea of split screens was born out of the the amount of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in connecting them. the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element in the series.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="running-clock">Running clock</h4>
<p>The idea of the running clock initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the shows fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock which appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller, silent clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the <a href="in-universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">in-universe</a> time of the story.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When the running clock is shown, an alternating beeping noise for each second can usually be heard. This ticking is absent on rare occasions in the series, such as following the death of a major character or after a disastrous event.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="real-time">Real time</h4>
<p>The concept of real time started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing 24 episodes in a season, which each episode lasting an hour. They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a &quot;race against the clock&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact amount of time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. Mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In line with the depiction of events in real time, <em>24</em> does not use <a href="slow_motion" title="wikilink">slow motion</a> techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours.<ref name="Hanks&nbsp;<U+2014> Jack Back&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>

CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to &quot;Divisions&quot;, and Divisions reporting to the &quot;District&quot;. While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the <a href="National_Counterterrorism_Center" title="wikilink">National Counterterrorism Center</a>, have emerged since the show's debut on television.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in old pencil factory in <a href="Chatsworth,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Chatsworth</a>. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but was redesigned before the start of the fourth season, and again before the start of the eight season.

Several actors from <em>La Femme Nikita</em> have portrayed similar roles on <em>24</em>, a number of story concepts from <em>La Femme Nikita</em> have been revisited on <em>24</em>, and many of the creative personnel from <em>La Femme Nikita</em> worked on <em>24</em> in their same role.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>A feature film adaptation of <em>24</em> was originally planned for the hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons.

<p>It was later decided that the film would begin after the conclusion of the eighth and final season. It was to take be set and shot on-location in Europe.

Kiefer Sutherland attributed the show's strong support from Fox to its early success in the UK.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Its viewership in the UK decreased significantly when the BBC lost the rights to subscription channel <a href="Sky1" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sky1</a> after the second season.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>The release of <em>24</em> on DVD had a significant impact on the success of the television series. In an interview with <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> in 2002, Sutherland revealed, &quot;[<em>24</em>'s] success in [the UK] was phenomenal. It was the biggest show the BBC has ever had. It was the number one DVD there, knocking off <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy" title="wikilink">Lord of the Rings</a></em>, which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available. And that's because they showed it without commercials.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The U.S. sales of the season one DVDs increased the audience size of season two by 25%.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>A special edition of the first season was released on May 20, 2008. The new set includes a seventh disc of bonus features, while discs 1&lt;U+2013&gt;6 contain all 24 episodes with deleted scenes, audio commentaries, and 5 extended episodes. The set was packaged in a steel box.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>The television movie <em><a href="24:_Redemption" title="wikilink">24: Redemption</a></em> was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 25, 2008, and in Region 2 on December 1, 2008. The DVD contains the broadcast version as well as an extended version with optional audio commentary, a making-of featurette, child soldiers in Africa featurette, a season 6 recap, and the first 17 minutes of the season 7 premiere episode.</p>
<p>The seventh season was the first season to be released on Blu-ray format.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The eighth season was also released on Blu-ray. A complete series set was released on DVD along with the release of season eight.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>All eight seasons and <em><a href="24:_Redemption" title="wikilink">24: Redemption</a></em> are also available for purchase on <a href="iTunes" class="uri" title="wikilink">iTunes</a>, <a href="Amazon_Video_on_Demand" title="wikilink">Amazon Video on Demand</a>, and the <a href="Zune_Marketplace" title="wikilink">Zune Marketplace</a>.</p>
