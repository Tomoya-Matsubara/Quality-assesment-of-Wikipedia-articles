<p>The <strong>Bethel Woods Center for the Arts</strong> is a state-of-the-art performing arts center located at the site of the 1969 <a href="Woodstock_Festival" title="wikilink">Woodstock Festival</a> in <a href="Bethel,_New_York" title="wikilink">Bethel, New York</a>. The hope of its founders is to provide artists with the opportunity to play and perform on one of music&lt;U+2019&gt;s most legendary grounds while providing a catalyst for strong economic growth for the <a href="Sullivan_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Sullivan County, New York</a> area and a premier cultural destination for music lovers and concert goers.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1996, cable television pioneer and philanthropist Alan Gerry purchased the original festival field and 1,700 surrounding acres, with eventual plans for an arts center. Bethel Woods is a multi-venue performing arts complex that can accommodate 15,000 fans at the main outdoor concert pavilion.</p>
<p>Bethel Woods features a  stage, a 4,500 covered seat pavilion and a sloping lawn accommodating up to 10,500 people. The outdoor terrace stage has space for 1,000, and the <a href="Woodstock_Festival" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a> Site Festival Field can accommodate events up to 30,000 capacities.</p>
<p>The inaugural season of 2006 included 9 show days, while in 2007 that number was increased to 16.</p>

<p>A museum and event gallery opened in June 2008 dedicated to the legacy of the 1969 <a href="Woodstock_Festival" title="wikilink">Woodstock Festival</a> and the decade it concluded. The $100 million project, launched by the Gerry Foundation in 2004, has employed over 650 New York State laborers and artisans in every trade and skill, many from the local area. The museums is designed to preserve the historic site on which the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair took place.</p>
<p>The interactive exhibits consist of audio/visual experiences, informative displays, and a collection of artifacts, and the permanent exhibits include: The Sixties, The Woodstock Festival, The Journey to Woodstock, Three Days of Peace and Music&lt;U+2014&gt;Film, Legacies of the 1960s and Woodstock.</p>
<p>In addition to information about the music festival, which is about two-thirds of the museum's scope,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the museum offers exhibits, personal stories and a <a href="multi-media" class="uri" title="wikilink">multi-media</a> experience about various aspects of the 1960s, including music, fashion and political protest.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In addition, it focuses on issues such as the <a href="baby_boom" title="wikilink">baby boom</a>, <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, <a href="Civil_Rights_Movement" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Movement</a>, and the assassinations and riots that occurred during the decade, all of which contribute to the context of Woodstock.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The  museum includes a 132 seat <a href="High-definition_video" title="wikilink">high-definition</a> theater and a  gallery, as well as classrooms, a cafe, a museum shop, and a patio. A special exhibit gallery opened in 2009.</p>
<p>The museum is open ten months a year. It was hoped that the opening the museum will help revive tourism, which has suffered in the region following the closure of many resorts following the decline of the <a href="Borscht_Belt" title="wikilink">Borscht Belt</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> While Sullivan County has struggled, at times, with the legacy of Woodstock, officials hope the museum will help manage that.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Bethel is already benefiting from the opening of the performing arts center in 2006, and has led to increased development in the town and along nearby Kauneonga Lake,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the museum is seen as one of the county's larger <a href="economic_development" title="wikilink">economic development</a> programs, despite the controversy surrounding its funding.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="funding-controversy">Funding controversy</h3>
<p>$1 million in funding that the museum received from the <a href="U.S._Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a> in June 2007 was criticized after it was revealed the museum founder, Alan Gerry, then donated almost $30,000 to New York Senators <a href="Hillary_Clinton" title="wikilink">Hillary Clinton</a> and <a href="Charles_Schumer" title="wikilink">Charles Schumer</a>, who had helped to secure the funding.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The funding was rescinded in October 2007 following criticism from <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republicans</a> led by <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> although it did not affect the museum's scheduled opening<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> nor the more than $15 million in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">state</a> funding.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
