<p><strong>Robert Hues</strong> (1553 &lt;U+2013&gt; 24 May 1632) was an English <a href="mathematician" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> and <a href="geographer" class="uri" title="wikilink">geographer</a>. He graduated from <a href="St_Mary_Hall,_Oxford" title="wikilink">St. Mary Hall</a>, <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, in 1578 and may have travelled to <a href="Continental_Europe" title="wikilink">Continental Europe</a> thereafter. Hues became interested in <a href="geography" class="uri" title="wikilink">geography</a> and <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, and made observations of the <a href="magnetic_declination" title="wikilink">variations of the compass</a> off the coast of <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a>. He either went there on a fishing trip, or joined a 1585 voyage to <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> arranged by <a href="Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Walter Raleigh</a> and led by <a href="Richard_Grenville" title="wikilink">Richard Grenville</a> which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with <a href="Thomas_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Thomas Cavendish</a> on a <a href="circumnavigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">circumnavigation</a> of the globe, taking the opportunity to measure <a href="latitudes" class="uri" title="wikilink">latitudes</a>. In 1589, Hues went on the <a href="George_Clifford,_3rd_Earl_of_Cumberland" title="wikilink">Earl of Cumberland</a>'s raiding expedition to the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> to capture Spanish <a href="galleon" title="wikilink">galleons</a>. Beginning in August 1591, Hues travelled with Cavendish again, intending to complete another circumnavigation of the globe. They were accompanied by <a href="John_Davis_(English_explorer)" title="wikilink">John Davis</a>. During the voyage, while in the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">South Atlantic</a> Hues made <a href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomical</a> observations, and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the <a href="Equator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Equator</a>. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England with Davis in 1593.</p>
<p>In 1594, Hues published his discoveries in the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> work <em>Tractatus de globis et eorum usu</em> (<em>Treatise on Globes and their Use</em>) which was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by <a href="Emery_Molyneux" title="wikilink">Emery Molyneux</a> in late 1592 or early 1593, and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch (1597, 1613 and 1622), English (1638 and 1659), French (1618) and Latin (1611, 1613, 1617, 1627, 1659 and 1663).</p>
<p>Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh in the 1590s, and later became a servant of <a href="Thomas_Grey,_15th_Baron_Grey_de_Wilton" title="wikilink">Thomas Grey</a>, the 15th and last <a href="Baron_Grey_de_Wilton" title="wikilink">Baron Grey de Wilton</a>. While Grey was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="wikilink">Tower of London</a> for participating in the <a href="Bye_Plot" title="wikilink">Bye Plot</a>, Hues stayed with him. Following Grey's death in 1614, Hues attended upon <a href="Henry_Percy,_9th_Earl_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland</a>, when he was confined in the Tower; one source states that Hues, <a href="Thomas_Harriot" title="wikilink">Thomas Harriot</a> and <a href="Walter_Warner" title="wikilink">Walter Warner</a> were Northumberland's constant companions and known as his &quot;Three <a href="Magi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magi</a>&quot;, though this is disputed. Hues tutored Northumberland's sons <a href="Algernon_Percy,_10th_Earl_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Algernon Percy</a>, who subsequently became the 10th <a href="Earl_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Earl of Northumberland</a>, at Oxford; and later Algernon's younger brother Henry in 1622&lt;U+2013&gt;1623. In later years, Hues lived in <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> where he was a fellow of the University, and discussed mathematics and allied subjects with like-minded friends. He died on 24 May 1632 in the city and was buried in <a href="Christ_Church_Cathedral,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church Cathedral</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Hues was born in 1553 at <a href="Little_Hereford" title="wikilink">Little Hereford</a> (, )<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in <a href="Hertfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hertfordshire</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>.

<p>Hues became interested in <a href="geography" class="uri" title="wikilink">geography</a> and <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; an undated source indicates that he disputed accepted values of <a href="magnetic_declination" title="wikilink">variations of the compass</a> after making observations off the <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> coast. He either went there on a fishing trip, or may have joined a 1585 voyage to <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> arranged by Raleigh and led by <a href="Richard_Grenville" title="wikilink">Richard Grenville</a>, which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Hues perhaps become acquainted with the sailor <a href="Thomas_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Thomas Cavendish</a> at this time, as both of them were taught by Harriot at Raleigh's school of navigation. An anonymous 17th-century manuscript states that Hues <a href="circumnavigation" title="wikilink">circumnavigated</a> the world with Cavendish between 1586 and 1588 &quot;purposely for taking the true <a href="Latitude" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latitude</a> of places&quot;;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> he may have been the &quot;NH&quot; who wrote a brief account of the voyage that was published by Hakluyt in his 1589 work <em>The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation</em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the year that book appeared, Hues was with <a href="Edward_Wright_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Edward Wright</a> on the <a href="George_Clifford,_3rd_Earl_of_Cumberland" title="wikilink">Earl of Cumberland</a>'s raiding expedition to the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> to capture Spanish <a href="galleon" title="wikilink">galleons</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning in August 1591, Hues travelled with Cavendish again on the <em>Lester</em>, intending to complete another circumnavigation of the globe. They were accompanied by <a href="John_Davis_(English_explorer)" title="wikilink">John Davis</a> on the <em>Desire</em>. Unfortunately, Cavendish died on the way in 1592.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Hues returned to England with Davis in 1593.

<p><em>Tractatus de globis</em> begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign. However, he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spaniards</a> and <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> if they had a complete knowledge of <a href="astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomy</a> and <a href="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, which were essential to successful navigation.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the preface of the book, Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere, and refuted opposing theories.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The treatise was divided into five parts. The first part described elements common to Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, including the circles and lines inscribed on them, zones and climates, and the use of each globe's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The second part described <a href="planet" title="wikilink">planets</a>, <a href="fixed_stars" title="wikilink">fixed stars</a> and <a href="constellation" title="wikilink">constellations</a>; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe, and discussed the length of the <a href="Equator" title="wikilink">circumference of the earth</a> and of a <a href="degree_(angle)" title="wikilink">degree</a> of a <a href="great_circle" title="wikilink">great circle</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Part 4, which Hues considered the most important part of the work, explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun's position, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and <a href="azimuth" title="wikilink">azimuths</a>, and time and <a href="declination" class="uri" title="wikilink">declination</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on <a href="rhumb_line" title="wikilink">rhumb lines</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the work, Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the &quot;nautical triangle&quot; used for <a href="plane_sailing" title="wikilink">plane sailing</a>. Difference of latitude and departure (or <a href="longitude" class="uri" title="wikilink">longitude</a>) are two sides of the triangle forming a <a href="right_angle" title="wikilink">right angle</a>, the distance travelled is the <a href="hypotenuse" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypotenuse</a>, and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course. If any two elements are known, the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of <a href="trigonometric_functions#Sine" title="wikilink">sines</a>, <a href="trigonometric_functions#Tangent" title="wikilink">tangents</a> and <a href="trigonometric_functions#Reciprocal_functions" title="wikilink">secants</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1590s, Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh &lt;U+2013&gt; he was one of the executors of Raleigh's will<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; and he may have been the &quot;Hewes&quot; who dined with Northumberland regularly in 1591. He later became a servant of Thomas Grey, the 15th and last <a href="Baron_Grey_de_Wilton" title="wikilink">Baron Grey de Wilton</a> (1575&lt;U+2013&gt;1614). For participating in the <a href="Bye_Plot" title="wikilink">Bye Plot</a>, a conspiracy by <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> priest <a href="William_Watson_(priest)" title="wikilink">William Watson</a> to kidnap James I and force him to repeal anti-Catholic legislation, Grey was <a href="attainder" title="wikilink">attainted</a> and forfeited his title in 1603.

Grey was given consent for Hues to stay in the Tower with him.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Between 1605 and 1621, Northumberland was also confined in the Tower; he was suspected of involvement in the <a href="Gunpowder_Plot" title="wikilink">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605 because his relative <a href="Thomas_Percy_(plotter)" title="wikilink">Thomas Percy</a> was among the conspirators. Following Grey's death, in 1616 Hues began to be &quot;attendant upon th'aforesaid Earle of Northumberland for matters of learning&quot;,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and was paid a yearly sum of <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>40 to support his research until Northumberland's death in 1632.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Wood stated that Harriot, Hues and Warner were Northumberland's &quot;constant companions, and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's .
