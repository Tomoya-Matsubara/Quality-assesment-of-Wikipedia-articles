<p><strong>Katie Sierra</strong> (born 1986) is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Anarchism" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> and <a href="Peace_activist" title="wikilink">anti-war activist</a> who was controversially <a href="Suspension_(punishment)" title="wikilink">suspended</a> from <a href="high_school" title="wikilink">high school</a> in October 2001 for opposing the <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">bombing of Afghanistan</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> At the age of 15, she was engaged in anti-war activism at her school, <a href="Sissonville_High_School" title="wikilink">Sissonville High School</a> near <a href="Charleston,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Charleston, West Virginia</a>, wearing clothes with handwritten messages objecting to perceived U.S. militarism, racism, sexism and homophobia. When she applied for permission to start an anarchist club at the school, she was denied by the school's principal, and attempts at publicizing the club led to her being suspended from school for three days. Incendiary comments by the principal and the members of the school's board of education were reported in the press and provoked a controversy that garnered national and international media attention.</p>
<p>After verbal and physical assaults by Sierra's fellow students, her mother withdrew her from the school and, with the help of the <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, they initiated legal action against her headmaster and the school board. Initially unsuccessful and subject to various setbacks, these efforts eventually succeeded in overturning the school's decision not to allow the club, although the propriety of other actions by the school was upheld. Sierra briefly returned to Sissonville High in August 2002 before again withdrawing over peer harassment after less than a week. The actions and attitude of the school toward Sierra were sharply criticized in the media for what critics perceived as <a href="censorship" class="uri" title="wikilink">censorship</a> and <a href="McCarthyism" class="uri" title="wikilink">McCarthyism</a>, as a dark sign of post-<a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11th</a> American society and its conception of <a href="freedom_of_speech" title="wikilink">freedom of speech</a>. Sierra later went on to study at <a href="Marshall_University" title="wikilink">Marshall University</a> in <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="background-and-suspension">Background and suspension</h3>
<p>Sierra was born into a military family; her father fought in the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> and was later a civilian employee of the military, in which two of her brothers also served.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During Sierra's childhood, her family moved around frequently; prior to attending <a href="Sissonville_High_School" title="wikilink">Sissonville High School</a> in <a href="Pocatalico,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Pocatalico, West Virginia</a> (a community near <a href="Charleston,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Charleston</a>), she had attended eleven schools and lived in <a href="Panama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panama</a>, <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> and <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although described as a &quot;good student with no history of behavioral problems&quot;,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> she soon became embroiled in a controversy at the Charleston-area high school. On <a href="October_23" title="wikilink">October 23</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> Sierra asked the school's <a href="principal_(school)" title="wikilink">principal</a>, Forrest Mann, if she could start an <a href="anarchism" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> club at the school, after reading about the subject on <a href="Infoshop.org" class="uri" title="wikilink">Infoshop.org</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Among the possible club activities she mentioned were <a href="Book_discussion_club" title="wikilink">reading</a> and <a href="discussion_group" title="wikilink">discussion groups</a> and <a href="community_service" title="wikilink">community service</a>, while flyers for the club also proposed starting a <a href="zine" class="uri" title="wikilink">zine</a> (called the <em>Anny</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>) and a chapter of <a href="Food_Not_Bombs" title="wikilink">Food Not Bombs</a>, a hunger charity. The club's <a href="manifesto" class="uri" title="wikilink">manifesto</a> declared &quot;[t]his anarchist club will not tolerate hate or violence&lt;U+2026&gt;It is our final goal to dispel myths about anarchism, especially the belief that anarchy is <a href="chaos" class="uri" title="wikilink">chaos</a> and destruction&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Without reading Sierra's literature, Mann refused to grant permission for such a club in the school, and according to Sierra had to ask her several times to return to class when he would not explain his decision.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>  Sierra attended class wearing t-shirts with handwritten political slogans, a practice she claimed to have adopted long before the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>: among the messages written on the t-shirts were &quot;Against <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">Bush</a>, Against <a href="Osama_Bin_Laden" title="wikilink">Bin Laden</a>&quot; and &quot;When I saw the dead and dying Afghani children on TV, I felt a newly recovered sense of national security. God bless America.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Reading the back of Sierra's t-shirt, fellow student and aspirant <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Marine</a> Jacob Reed allegedly told her, &quot;If you don't like this country, then fucking leave&quot;, and subsequently received <a href="School_punishment#Detention" title="wikilink">detention</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The day of the incident, Mann summoned Sierra to his office and told her she would no longer be allowed to wear the shirts, and claimed that Sierra had violated his prior orders by making flyers for the club available to other students. Mann <a href="Suspension_(punishment)" title="wikilink">suspended</a> her for three days, on the charge of disrupting the education of her fellow students.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Sierra then contacted the <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, who agreed to take up her cause. After a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, the issue was considered settled.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="escalation">Escalation</h3>
<p>On October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school, a meeting of the school's <a href="board_of_education" title="wikilink">board of education</a> was held which discussed the events of the previous week. Although some board members were initially helpful, comments turned hostile towards the end of the meeting, with Sierra being told &quot;[t]his isn't something funny or cute&lt;U+2026&gt;[y]ou're talking about overthrowing the <a href="government" class="uri" title="wikilink">government</a>&quot;, and having her actions characterized as &quot;like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on <a href="Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Pearl Harbor day</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked &quot;[w]hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?&quot; and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing <a href="treason" class="uri" title="wikilink">treason</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, <em><a href="The_Charleston_Gazette" title="wikilink">The Charleston Gazette</a></em> published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's t-shirts included &quot;I hope Afghanistan wins&quot; and &quot;America should burn.&quot;; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Students spit on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="legal-action-and-runaway">Legal action and runaway</h3>

<p>The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on <a href="December_9" title="wikilink">December 9</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> against the school district and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the <a href="Kanawha_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Kanawha County</a> <a href="Circuit_court#State_courts" title="wikilink">circuit court</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Sierra's <a href="pro_bono" title="wikilink">pro bono</a> lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, and that he could have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her voluntary withdrawal from the county school system,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that that the disruption Sierra caused at school overrode her <a href="right_to_free_speech" title="wikilink">right to free speech</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and told that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The <a href="West_Virginia_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">West Virginia Supreme Court</a> voted 3-2 on November 27 against considering Sierra's petition to prevent the lower court from &quot;continuing to deny her freedom of speech&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Motivated by boredom and antipathy towards the &quot;backward&lt;U+2026&gt;narrow-minded&lt;U+2026&gt;racist and sexist&quot; residents of Charleston, Sierra ran away from home on <a href="April_8" title="wikilink">April 8</a> <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Accompanied by a 24-year-old friend, Holly Elizabeth Taylor, she <a href="hitchhiking" title="wikilink">hitched</a> rides with <a href="trucker" title="wikilink">truckers</a> to <a href="Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>. There, the self-proclaimed &quot;road sisters&quot; took in a concert by <a href="Tanya_Donelly" title="wikilink">Tanya Donelly</a>, whose attempts to convince them to turn back were futile. Although Sierra successfully eluded the police, Taylor was discovered by Sierra's mother and a <a href="private_detective" title="wikilink">private detective</a> she had hired, forcing Sierra to continue alone to <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> where she stayed with a friend. Her mother and the private detective tracked her down after tracing her phone calls to friends, and they returned to West Virginia. Commenting on the escapade, Sierra declared &quot;You're never free. You're always trapped. This is a corrupt society. I'm paranoid to even use the phone anymore.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trial-and-return-to-sissonville">Trial and return to Sissonville</h3>

<p>The ACLU lawyers decided to drop their suit on June 5 that year after learning that Sierra had moved out of her mother's home and intended on traveling through <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>, and therefore would not be present at the trial date.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> A day later, they reversed their decision after consulting with Sierra's mother, who had to file the suit on behalf of her daughter, who was a <a href="minor_(law)" title="wikilink">minor</a> at the time.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The subsequent trial lasted five days, attracting <em><a href="Court_TV" title="wikilink">Court TV</a></em>, coverage in several <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> major newspapers and television shows,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and a gallery packed with supporters of both sides.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>At the trial, Sierra's former English teacher Jean McCutcheon testified that Sierra's activities at Sissonville High had caused a &quot;simmering feeling&quot;, and that she had counseled Sierra that it was a &quot;terrible time in history&quot; to start a club such as the one proposed.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Jacob Reed, the student who had been detained for his comments to Sierra, testified that the &quot;only reason&quot; for Sierra's actions was that she &quot;wants attention&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He also claimed that Sierra told him she hoped America would lose the <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">War in Afghanistan</a>, and asked why Sierra was opposed to what he saw was &quot;pretty much payback&quot; for the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The philosophy of <a href="anarchism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchism</a> was also a point of contention during the trial. <a href="Gordon_Simmons" title="wikilink">Gordon Simmons</a>, an adjunct professor of philosophy at <a href="West_Virginia_State_University" title="wikilink">West Virginia State University</a> and <a href="Marshall_University" title="wikilink">Marshall University</a>, testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, and the notion that anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the <a href="Haymarket_affair" title="wikilink">Haymarket affair</a> and <a href="Sacco_and_Vanzetti" title="wikilink">Sacco and Vanzetti</a>. The lawyer for the school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to <a href="Propaganda_of_the_deed" title="wikilink">terrorism and assassination</a>, and referred to <a href="Timothy_McVeigh" title="wikilink">Timothy McVeigh</a> and <a href="Theodore_Kaczynski" title="wikilink">Theodore Kaczynski</a> as anarchists.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> On July 12, the court ruled that Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the t-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The ban on her right to return to the school having been lifted,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Sierra returned to Sissonville High in August 2002.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In her first week back at the school, she was harassed, mocked and insulted by other students.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Sissonville had by this point a new principal, Calvin McKinney who replaced Forrest Mann after the latter resigned from the school system following the controversy.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> McKinney identified Sierra's &quot;questionable attire&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; a t-shirt of <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk</a> band <a href="Anti-Flag" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anti-Flag</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; as a possible trigger of her negative reception.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Although she had secured a sponsor for the anarchist club, McKinney did not grant his approval, citing the need for a lengthy legal confirmation process. After attending Sissonville High for five days, Sierra dropped out of the school.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reaction-to-controversy">Reaction to controversy</h2>
<p><img src="Katie_Sierra_in_the_Land_of_the_Free.gif" title="fig:Katie Sierra in the Land of the Free, a political cartoon by Indymedia&#39;s Carlos Latuff" alt="Katie Sierra in the Land of the Free, a political cartoon by Indymedia&#39;s Carlos Latuff" /> The controversy over Sierra's suspension and the subsequent trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher &lt;U+2013&gt; editor of the <em>Charleston Gazette</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the <em>Gazette</em> of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The <em><a href="Charleston_Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Charleston Daily Mail</a></em> praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's &quot;thoroughly egocentric exercise&quot; of her <a href="constitutional_rights" title="wikilink">constitutional rights</a> &quot;tiresome&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations &quot;wanted to shoot me in the head. They wanted to send me to another country.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Conversely, national and international observers were supportive of Sierra and sharply critical of the actions of the state. John Tinker, of <em><a href="Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District" title="wikilink">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a></em>, pledged his support for Katie, personally emailing Sierra to encourage her and offered to attend further court proceedings. Sierra reported, &quot;he said he'd be in the front row of the courtroom...&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> political writer <a href="George_Monbiot" title="wikilink">George Monbiot</a> decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as an example of state <a href="persecution" class="uri" title="wikilink">persecution</a> and the erosion of <a href="civil_liberties" title="wikilink">civil liberties</a> in the United States,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> while <a href="progressivism" title="wikilink">progressive</a> journalist <a href="Amy_Goodman" title="wikilink">Amy Goodman</a> characterized it as evidence of &quot;a new <a href="McCarthyism" class="uri" title="wikilink">McCarthyism</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A <a href="New_York_University" title="wikilink">New York University</a> drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, <em>United We Stand</em>, inspired by Sierra's actions.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Sierra was one of the &quot;heroes&quot; of <a href="Pulitzer_Prize" title="wikilink">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning author <a href="Dale_Maharidge" title="wikilink">Dale Maharidge</a>'s <em>Homeland</em>, an examination of the <a href="mind-set" class="uri" title="wikilink">mind-set</a> behind the United States' post-9/11 <a href="jingoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">jingoism</a> and suppression of dissent.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Portraying her as an unconventional and &quot;good-hearted kid,&quot; Maharidge reported that Sierra took a <a href="telemarketing" class="uri" title="wikilink">telemarketing</a> job following the cessation of the controversy: &quot;She was supposed to make two sales a day. The first day, she made five sales, and continued at that rate. When I again talked with her in the winter, she was living in a dorm and attending <a href="Marshall_University" title="wikilink">Marshall University</a> in West Virginia.
