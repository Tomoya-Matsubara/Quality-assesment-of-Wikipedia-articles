<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Colaco was born on 22 June 1953 in <a href="Panjim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panjim</a> to parents &lt;U+2013&gt; Vincent Salvador Cola&lt;U+00E7&gt;o and Clarina Dias Cola&lt;U+00E7&gt;o. Having lost his father at a very young age, but never gave up on his ambitions of playing <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">football</a>, which he did right from a young age during his schooling at Don Boscos where Fr Joseph Casti and Fr Thomas, in particular, encouraged the footballer in the youthful Armando. According to Armando, it was Sir Edwin, Domnic, Wilson Paes, along with Fr Simon, Fr Edward and Fr Benedict who played an important role in his life as far as his early upbringing was concerned. Later in his life, his wife Juliana and daughter Genevieve have been his motivation and support.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="first-team-career">First-Team Career</h3>
<p>After gaining the necessary exposure with Don Bosco and Panjim Gymkhana, Armando, who was at the end of his teens, took a career-shaping step in the 1970-71 season when he was chosen to play for <a href="Dempo_S.C." title="wikilink">Dempo</a> for the first time, under coach Joseph Ratnam, who taught his wards how to play football with discipline. &lt;U+201C&gt;That was a very important phase of my career as far as shaping the destiny of my football talent was concerned as I got picked for a big club &lt;U+2013&gt; Dempo,&lt;U+201D&gt; Armando reminisced. Though he made Dempo his abode for the next 14 years to come, as a player, the hardworking Armando plied his trade with dedication and commitment before he hung his boots in 1985.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="managerial-career">Managerial career</h2>
<h3 id="early-coaching">Early Coaching</h3>
<p>A recipient of the State Kerkar award, Armando, had to look beyond his retirement as a player and it were two men &lt;U+2013&gt; Alberto Cola&lt;U+00E7&gt;o, the present AIFF secretary, and Agnelo Mascarenhas, who encouraged the just-retired Dempo player to move into football coaching. And thus began a new journey for Armando the coach. From 1985-88, the Curtorim-based trainer, essayed himself into coaching Salcete Football Club and soon guided the club to a win in Stafford Cup. Soon, Armando had a one-year offer from <a href="SESA_Football_Academy" title="wikilink">Sesa Goa</a>, which he accepted with delight and during the 1988-89 season, the team won the Vitthal Trophy under his guidance. That actually set the tone for his coaching stints elsewhere as Armando, who was fast gathering moss, rolled on like a stone, and successfully coached the state U-21 Santosh team partnering Peter Vales and also Goa U-23 team at the <a href="BC_Roy_Trophy" title="wikilink">BC Roy Trophy</a> in the early 90s. That was after a year-long stint with <a href="Dempo_S.C." title="wikilink">Dempo S.C.</a> (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90) where he won the Pomes Cup and Scissors Cup.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="churchill-brothers-sc">Churchill Brothers SC</h3>

Switching his base from Dempo to Churchill in the 90s, Armando had announced his arrival as a seasoned coach with three <a href="Goa_Professional_League" title="wikilink">Goa Football League</a> titles and an <a href="National_Football_League_(India)" title="wikilink">NFL</a> runner-up trophy with Churchill Brothers and also a foray into the <a href="AFC_Cup" title="wikilink">AFC Cup</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dempo-sc">Dempo SC</h3>
<p>In 2000, came a Clarion call from Mr Shrinivas V Dempo, offering Armando to coach his team, which had hit a trough in the <a href="National_Football_League_(India)" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> following a demotion. Having agreed to accept the challenge, Armando greeted the opportunity to redefine the destiny of a football club, which under his patronage has risen from the dust to virtually touch the skys.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

Also he won Dempo three <a href="I-League" class="uri" title="wikilink">I-League</a> titles in <a href="2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08_I-League" title="wikilink">2007-08</a> and <a href="2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10_I-League" title="wikilink">2009-10</a> and <a href="2011&lt;U+2013&gt;12_I-League" title="wikilink">2011-12</a>. After the 2012-13 season where Dempo finished in 5th place, they parted ways with Armando Colaco with whom they had won 5 League titles.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
