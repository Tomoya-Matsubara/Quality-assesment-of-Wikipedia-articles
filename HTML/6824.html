<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Nagpur-Asansol main line of <a href="Bengal_Nagpur_Railway" title="wikilink">Bengal Nagpur Railway</a> came up in 1891 and the cross-country <a href="Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai_line" title="wikilink">Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line</a> started functioning in 1900.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>After independence of India, this area saw a lot of activity. In the 1950s when <a href="Rourkela_Steel_Plant" title="wikilink">Rourkela Steel Plant</a> was being constructed, a marshalling yard was set up at Bondamunda to cater to the requirements of bulk transportation. New lines were added. A  line was constructed to establish a direct link with <a href="Ranchi_Junction" title="wikilink">Ranchi</a>. Bondamunda was connected to Barsuan iron ore mines in 1960 and the line was extended to Kiriburu in 1964. The marshalling yard is the second largest in India.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
