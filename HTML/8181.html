<p>Derry lost at the semi-final stage of the 2001 Ulster Championship, but nonetheless reached the All-Ireland semi-final through the qualifiers, where they once again faced Galway. Derry again lost to Galway, despite a goal scored by Muldoon.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Muldoon scored 2-10 (16) in that year's Championship.

However Muldoon, with a previously exemplary disciplinary record at all levels,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> was red-carded late in that game. Some commentators called for Muldoon's red card to be rescinded after television replays showed he was reacting to &quot;extreme provocation&quot; from Donegal full back Paddy Campbell, who had punched Muldoon in the groin.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Muldoon however received a four week suspension and missed Derry's next two games against <a href="Kildare_GAA" title="wikilink">Kildare</a> and <a href="Longford_GAA" title="wikilink">Longford</a>.
