<p>'''Jess Stonestreet Jackson, Jr. ''' (February 18, 1930 â€“ April 21, 2011) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="wine" class="uri" title="wikilink">wine</a> <a href="entrepreneur" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneur</a> and self-made businessman. He started the <a href="Kendall-Jackson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kendall-Jackson</a> wine business with the family's 1974 purchase of an  <a href="pear" class="uri" title="wikilink">pear</a> and <a href="walnut" class="uri" title="wikilink">walnut</a> <a href="orchard" class="uri" title="wikilink">orchard</a> in <a href="Lakeport,_California" title="wikilink">Lakeport, California</a> that was converted to a <a href="vineyard" class="uri" title="wikilink">vineyard</a>. The first release of Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay in 1982 closed the gap between the super premium and cheap wine market. Today, Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay is one of the most popular wines on the market.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His style as a <a href="vintner" class="uri" title="wikilink">vintner</a> was focused upon single-vineyard, mountain grown wines.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and education</h2>
<p>Jess Jackson grew up during the Great Depression and was raised in <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Sunset_District,_San_Francisco" title="wikilink">Sunset District</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His father, a teacher, was out of work three times while he was growing up, and there were times when the family had to survive only on rice. To help support his family, Jackson started working at an early age. From the age of five, when he got his first job as a paper boy, he worked a variety of careers, including candy maker, a soda jerk, a temp at the post office, a hops picker, a longshoreman, a teamster, a lifeguard, an ambulance driver, among other things, all before graduating from the University of California Berkeley law school.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson graduated from San Francisco's <a href="Abraham_Lincoln_High_School_(San_Francisco,_California)" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln High School</a>. He earned a law degree from <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Boalt Hall Law School</a> at the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a>. While studying law he simultaneously held down jobs as a dock laborer, <a href="Berkeley,_California" title="wikilink">Berkeley</a> policeman and an ambulance driver to put himself through school. Upon his graduation from Boalt in 1951, Jackson started practicing real estate law.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In the late 1950s, Jess Jackson started a law firm in the San Francisco area, specializing in property rights issues, that went on to argue cases in front of the <a href="Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a>. Jackson was one of the founding members of the <a href="American_California_Trial_Lawyers_Association" title="wikilink">American California Trial Lawyers Association</a>. He also pursued other business interests, including being one of the four founding members in the 1970s of Decimus, a company which leased <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a> mainframe computers to corporations.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <embed src="Jess_Jackson_Founder_Of_Kendall_Jackson.jpg&lt;U+200E&gt;" title="fig:Jess Jackson, owner of Jackson Family Wines and Stonestreet Farms" /></p>
<p>In 1974 Jackson and then wife, Jane Kendall Jackson, purchased an 80-acre pear-and-walnut orchard in Lakeport. He converted it to growing premium <a href="Chardonnay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chardonnay</a> and other varietals after realizing that there was increasing demand for high-quality grapes in the area. He sold the property&lt;U+2019&gt;s grapes to local wineries until 1981, when a down market led to a surplus of grapes on the market. Faced with the prospect of selling his grapes for a price that wouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t cover the costs of growing them, he decided to make his own wine. Instead of following the market by producing low-quality, inexpensive wines, Jackson studied the market and realized that there was a shortage of high-quality wines at affordable prices. He decided to produce wines that would fill that gap, and, two years later, he released the first <a href="Kendall-Jackson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kendall-Jackson</a> Vintner&lt;U+2019&gt;s Reserve Chardonnay. That year it became the first wine to ever win a Platinum Award from the American Wine Competition.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson and Kendall divorced in the early 1980s and Jackson later married Barbara Banke. Banke became his lifelong partner and co-manager of their wine businesses. Jackson and Banke continued to expand their business, eventually owning about 25,000 acres in California, 14,000 of which were planted with wine grapes.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1992, Jackson prevailed in a highly contentious lawsuit against his former winemaker Jed Steele that prohibited Steele from revealing the formula for the Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay. In 1997, Jackson lost a lawsuit against <a href="E_&amp;_J_Gallo_Winery" title="wikilink">E &amp; J Gallo Winery</a> in which Jackson alleged that Gallo's Turning Leaf label was a ripoff of his Vintner's Reserve.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the wineries in his Jackson Family Wines portfolio, as of 2009, are <a href="Kendall-Jackson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kendall-Jackson</a>, Murphy-Goode,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Robert Pecota Winery,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Byron Estates, Edmeades, Matanzas Creek, La Crema, Stonestreet, Arrowood, Lajota, Cardinale, Atalon, Lokoya, Carmel Road, Cambria, Hartford Family Wines, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;rit&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Archipel, Chateau Potelle, and <a href="Freemark_Abbey" title="wikilink">Freemark Abbey</a>.
