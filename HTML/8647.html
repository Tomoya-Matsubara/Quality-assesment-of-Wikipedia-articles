<p>As a medical diagnosis, <strong>pedophilia</strong> (USA spelling) or <strong>paedophilia</strong> (British spelling) is a <a href="mental_disorder" title="wikilink">psychiatric disorder</a> in persons 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive <a href="Sexual_attraction" title="wikilink">sexual interest</a> toward prepubescent children (generally age 11 years or younger, though specific diagnostic criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> An adolescent who is 16 years of age or older must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child before the attraction can be diagnosed as pedophilia.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

The <a href="International_Classification_of_Diseases" title="wikilink">International Classification of Diseases</a> (ICD) defines pedophilia as a &quot;disorder of adult personality and behaviour&quot; in which there is a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early <a href="Puberty" title="wikilink">pubertal</a> age.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is termed <em>pedophilic disorder</em> in the <em><a href="Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" title="wikilink">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></em> (<a href="DSM-5" class="uri" title="wikilink">DSM-5</a>), and the manual defines it as a <a href="paraphilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">paraphilia</a> in which adults or adolescents 16 years of age or older have intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and <a href="fantasy_(psychology)" title="wikilink">fantasies</a> about prepubescent children that they have either acted on or which cause them distress or <a href="Interpersonal_relationship" title="wikilink">interpersonal</a> difficulty.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In popular usage, the word <em>pedophilia</em> is often used to mean any sexual interest in children or the act of <a href="child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">child sexual abuse</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> For example, <em><a href="The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language" title="wikilink">The American Heritage</a> Stedman's Medical Dictionary</em> states, &quot;Pedophilia is the act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This common use sometimes conflates the sexual interest in and sexual contact with pubescent or post-pubescent <a href="Minor_(law)" title="wikilink">minors</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse commonly exhibit the disorder,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> some offenders do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards for pedophilia and these standards pertain to prepubescents.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s.

<h2 id="etymology-and-definitions">Etymology and definitions</h2>
<p>The word comes from the  (<em>pa&lt;U+00EE&gt;s</em>), meaning &quot;child&quot;, and &lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; (<em><a href="Philia" title="wikilink">phil&lt;U+00ED&gt;a</a></em>), &quot;friendly love&quot; or &quot;friendship&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As <em>pedophilia</em> denotes sexual attraction, the term's Greek meaning is not employed by medical authorities; further, the terms &quot;child love&quot; and &quot;child lover&quot; are used by pedophiles who use symbols and codes to identify their sexual preference toward prepubescent children.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="disease-models">Disease models</h3>
<p>The term <strong><em>paedophilia erotica</em></strong> was coined in 1886 by the <a href="Vienna" title="wikilink">Viennese</a> psychiatrist <a href="Richard_von_Krafft-Ebing" title="wikilink">Richard von Krafft-Ebing</a> in his writing <em><a href="Psychopathia_Sexualis" title="wikilink">Psychopathia Sexualis</a></em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The term appears in a section titled &quot;Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen&quot;, which focuses on the <a href="forensic_psychiatry" title="wikilink">forensic psychiatry</a> aspect of <a href="Child_sexual_abuse#Offenders" title="wikilink">child sexual offenders</a> in general. Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into <a href="psychopathology" title="wikilink">psychopathological</a> and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Krafft-Ebing mentioned <em>paedophilia erotica</em> in a typology of &quot;psycho-sexual perversion&quot;. He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>The individual is tainted [by heredity] (<em>heredit&lt;U+00E4&gt;r belastate</em>)<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></li>
<li>The subject's primary attraction is to children, rather than adults.</li>
<li>The acts committed by the subject are typically not intercourse, but rather involve inappropriate touching or manipulating the child into performing an act on the subject.</li>
</ol>
<p>He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the abuse of boys by homosexual men to be extremely rare.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or <a href="neurology" title="wikilink">neurological</a> disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists <em>pseudopaedophilia</em> as a related condition wherein &quot;individuals who have lost <a href="libido" class="uri" title="wikilink">libido</a> for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite&quot; and claimed this is much more common.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Austrian neurologist <a href="Sigmund_Freud" title="wikilink">Sigmund Freud</a> briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book <em><a href="Three_Essays_on_the_Theory_of_Sexuality" title="wikilink">Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</a></em> in a section titled <em>The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects.</em> He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person &quot;makes use of such substitutes&quot; or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1908, <a href="Swiss_people" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> <a href="neuroanatomy" title="wikilink">neuroanatomist</a> and psychiatrist <a href="Auguste_Forel" title="wikilink">Auguste Forel</a> wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as &quot;Pederosis&quot;, the &quot;Sexual Appetite for Children&quot;. Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with <a href="dementia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dementia</a> and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The term <em>pedophilia</em> became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular <a href="Medical_dictionary" title="wikilink">medical dictionaries</a> such as the 5th Edition of <em>Stedman's</em> in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the <a href="Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" title="wikilink">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification &quot;Sexual Deviation&quot;, but no diagnostic criteria were provided. The DSM-III, published in 1980, contained a full description of the disorder and provided a set of guidelines for diagnosis.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The revision in 1987, the DSM-III-R, kept the description largely the same, but updated and expanded the diagnostic criteria.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="diagnostic-criteria">Diagnostic criteria</h3>
<h4 id="icd-10-and-dsm">ICD-10 and DSM</h4>
<p>The <em><a href="ICD-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICD-10</a></em> defines pedophilia as &quot;a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Under this system's criteria, a person 16 years of age or older meets the definition if they have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> 5th edition (DSM-5) has a significantly larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia than the previous DSM version, the <a href="DSM-IV-TR" class="uri" title="wikilink">DSM-IV-TR</a>, and states, &quot;The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;13 year old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to <a href="incest" class="uri" title="wikilink">incest</a>, and if the attraction is &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;nonexclusive&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Many terms have been used to distinguish &quot;true pedophiles&quot; from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see <a href="Child_sexual_abuse#Offenders" title="wikilink">child sexual offender types</a>). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as <em>true pedophiles.</em> They are attracted to prepubescent children, and prepubescent children only. They show no erotic interest in adults their own age and can only become aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Non-exclusive offenders&lt;U+2014&gt;or &quot;non-exclusive pedophiles&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;may at times be referred to as <em>non-pedophilic</em> offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If a preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Neither the ICD nor the DSM diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of <em>fantasies</em> or <em>sexual urges</em> even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. <em>Acting</em> on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include <a href="indecent_exposure" title="wikilink">indecent exposure</a>, <a href="voyeurism" title="wikilink">voyeuristic</a> or <a href="frotteurism" title="wikilink">frotteuristic</a> behaviors,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> or masturbating to <a href="child_pornography" title="wikilink">child pornography</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Ego-dystonic_sexual_orientation" title="wikilink">Ego-dystonic sexual orientation</a> () includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both).</p>
<h4 id="debate-regarding-the-dsm-criteria">Debate regarding the DSM criteria</h4>
<p>The DSM-IV-TR criteria was criticized simultaneously for being over-inclusive, as well as under-inclusive.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Though most researchers distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Studer and Aylwin argue that the DSM criteria are over-inclusive because all acts of child molestation warrant the diagnosis. A child molester satisfies criteria A because of the behavior involving sexual activity with prepubescent children and criteria B because the individual has acted on those urges.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Furthermore, they argue that it also is under-inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act upon it and are not distressed by it.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The latter point has also been made by several other researchers who have remarked that a so-called &quot;contented pedophile&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;an individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward&lt;U+2014&gt;does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person does not meet Criterion B.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used. As an explanation, it was suggested that the under-inclusiveness, as well as a lack of validity, reliability and clarity might have led to the rejection of the DSM classification.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Ray_Blanchard" title="wikilink">Ray Blanchard</a>, an <a href="Canadians_of_American_origin" title="wikilink">American-Canadian</a> <a href="Sexology" title="wikilink">sexologist</a> known for his research studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between <em>paraphilia</em> and <em>paraphilic disorder</em>. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but <em>not</em> diagnosed as having a paraphilia.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under <em>pedophilic disorder</em>, but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the <a href="American_Psychiatric_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychiatric Association</a>,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> but the distinction between <em>paraphilia</em> and <em>paraphilic disorder</em> was implemented.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association stated that &quot;[i]n the case of pedophilic disorder, the notable detail is what wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t revised in the new manual. Although proposals were discussed throughout the DSM-5 development process, diagnostic criteria ultimately remained the same as in DSM-IV TR&quot; and that &quot;[o]nly the disorder name will be changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder to maintain consistency with the chapter&lt;U+2019&gt;s other listings.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM-5 diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor).<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Donohue, however, suggests that the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting &quot;this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E. Barbaree and <a href="Michael_C._Seto" title="wikilink">Michael C. Seto</a> disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach in 1997 and instead recommended the use of actions as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia, as a means of <a href="taxonomy_(biology)" title="wikilink">taxonomic</a> simplification.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="other-uses">Other uses</h4>
<p>In a 1993 review of research on child sexual abuse, Sharon Araji and <a href="David_Finkelhor" title="wikilink">David Finkelhor</a> stated that because this field of research was underdeveloped at that time, there are &quot;definitional problems&quot; resulting from lack of standardization among researchers in their use of the term &quot;pedophilia&quot;. They described two definitions, a &quot;restrictive&quot; form referring to individuals with strong and exclusive sexual interest in children, and an &quot;inclusive&quot; definition, expanding the term to include offenders who engaged in sexual contact with a child, including incest. They stated that they used the wider definition in their review paper because behavioral criteria are easier to identify and do not require complex analysis of an individual's motivations.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development-and-sexual-orientation">Development and sexual orientation</h2>
<p>Pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a <a href="Heterosexuality" title="wikilink">heterosexual</a> or homosexual <a href="sexual_orientation" title="wikilink">sexual orientation</a> because it emerges before or during puberty, and because it is stable over time.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and pedophiles can sometimes be helped by mental health professionals to refrain from acting on their impulses.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="psychopathology-and-personality-traits">Psychopathology and personality traits</h2>
<p>Several researchers have reported correlations between pedophilia and certain psychological characteristics, such as low <a href="self-esteem" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-esteem</a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and poor social skills.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Cohen et al. (2002), studying child sex offenders, states that pedophiles have impaired interpersonal functioning and elevated <a href="passive-aggressive_behavior" title="wikilink">passive-aggressiveness</a>, as well as impaired <a href="self-concept" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-concept</a>. Regarding disinhibitory traits, pedophiles demonstrate elevated <a href="psychopathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychopathy</a> and propensity for cognitive distortions. According to the authors, pathologic personality traits in pedophiles lend support to a hypothesis that such pathology is related to both motivation for and failure to inhibit pedophilic behavior.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Wilson and Cox (1983), &quot;The paedophiles emerge as significantly higher on Psychoticism, Introversion and Neurotocism than age-matched controls. [But] there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social approbation and hostility that it evokes&quot; (p. 324).<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Studying child sex offenders, a review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that pedophiles use <a href="cognitive_distortion" title="wikilink">cognitive distortions</a> to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult&lt;U+2013&gt;child relationships.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Other cognitive distortions include the idea of &quot;children as sexual beings&quot;, &quot;uncontrollability of sexuality&quot;, and &quot;sexual entitlement-bias&quot;.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>One review of the literature concludes that research on personality correlates and <a href="psychopathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychopathology</a> in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>While not causes of pedophilia themselves, <a href="Child_abuse" title="wikilink">childhood abuse</a> by adults or <a href="comorbidity" title="wikilink">comorbid</a> psychiatric illnesses&lt;U+2014&gt;such as <a href="personality_disorder" title="wikilink">personality disorders</a> and <a href="substance_abuse" title="wikilink">substance abuse</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;are risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) noted about comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, &quot;The theoretical implications are not so clear. Do particular genes or noxious factors in the prenatal environment predispose a male to develop both affective disorders and pedophilia, or do the frustration, danger, and isolation engendered by unacceptable sexual desires&lt;U+2014&gt;or their occasional furtive satisfaction&lt;U+2014&gt;lead to anxiety and despair?&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> They indicated that, because they previously found mothers of pedophiles to be more likely to have undergone psychiatric treatment,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> the genetic possibility is more likely.</p>

<p>The term <em>pedophile</em> is commonly used to describe all <a href="child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">child sexual abuse</a> offenders, including those who do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards, which is seen as problematic by researchers,<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> as most of them distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> There can be motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> (such as stress, marital problems, or the unavailability of an adult partner).<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> As child sexual abuse might not be an indicator that its perpetrator is a pedophile, offenders might be separated into two types: Exclusive (i.e., &quot;true pedophiles&quot;) and non-exclusive (or, in some cases, &quot;non-pedophilic&quot;). According to a U.S. study on 2429 adult male sex offenders who were categorized as &quot;pedophiles&quot;, only 7% identified themselves as exclusive; indicating that many or most child sexual abusers may fall into the non-exclusive category.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> However, the <a href="Mayo_Clinic" title="wikilink">Mayo Clinic</a> reports perpetrators who meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia offend more often than non-pedophile perpetrators, and with a greater number of victims.

<p>A review article in the <em><a href="British_Journal_of_Psychiatry" title="wikilink">British Journal of Psychiatry</a></em> notes the overlap between extrafamilial and intrafamilial offenders. One study found that around half of the fathers and stepfathers in its sample who were referred for committing extrafamilial abuse had also been abusing their own children.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>As stated by Abel, Mittleman, and Becker<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> (1985) and Ward <em>et al.</em> (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the two types of offenders' characteristics. Situational offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; have fewer, often familial victims; and have a general preference for adult partners. Pedophilic offenders, however, often start offending at an early age; often have a large number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. Research suggests that incest offenders recidivate at approximately half the rate of extrafamilial child molesters, and one study estimated that by the time of entry to treatment, nonincestuous pedophiles who molest boys had committed an average of 282 offenses against 150 victims.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="child-pornography">Child pornography</h2>
<p><a href="Child_pornography" title="wikilink">Child pornography</a> is commonly collected by pedophiles who use the images for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual uses, trading with other pedophiles, preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the <a href="child_grooming" title="wikilink">child grooming</a> process, or enticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of new child pornography or <a href="Prostitution_of_children" title="wikilink">child prostitution</a>.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>Pedophilia and child sexual abuse are generally seen as morally wrong and abnormal by society.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Research at the close of the 1980s showed that there was a great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in the general public about pedophilia (La Fontaine, 1990; Leberg, 1997). However, a more recent study showed that the public's perception has gradually become more well-informed on the subject.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="misuse-of-medical-terminology">Misuse of medical terminology</h3>
<p>The words <em>pedophile</em> and <em>pedophilia</em> are sometimes used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest or attraction to pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers and to other situations that do not fit within the clinical definitions. The terms <em><a href="hebephilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">hebephilia</a></em> or <em><a href="ephebophilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ephebophilia</a></em> may be more accurate in these cases.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> This was especially seen in the case of <a href="Mark_Foley" title="wikilink">Mark Foley</a> during the <a href="Mark_Foley_congressional_page_incident" title="wikilink">congressional page incident</a>. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of <em><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a></em> magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p>Another common usage of <em>pedophilia</em> is to refer to the <a href="actus_reus" title="wikilink">actus reus</a> itself (that is, interchangeably with &quot;sexual abuse&quot;)<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a><a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a><a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> rather than the medical meaning, which is a <em>preference</em> for that age group on the part of the older individual.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either perceived socially as being too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Researchers recommend that the above imprecise uses be avoided.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> The <a href="Mayo_Clinic" title="wikilink">Mayo Clinic</a> states that <em>pedophilia</em> &quot;is not a criminal or legal term&quot;.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pedophile-advocacy-groups">Pedophile advocacy groups</h3>

<p>From the late 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile membership organizations advocated <a href="age_of_consent_reform" title="wikilink">age of consent reform</a> to lower or abolish <a href="age_of_consent" title="wikilink">age of consent</a> laws,<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a><a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a><a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> and for the acceptance of pedophilia as a <a href="sexual_orientation" title="wikilink">sexual orientation</a> rather than a <a href="psychological_disorder" title="wikilink">psychological disorder</a>,<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> and the legalization of <a href="child_pornography" title="wikilink">child pornography</a>.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain any public support<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a><a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a><a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a><a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anti-pedophile-activism">Anti-pedophile activism</h3>

<p>Anti-pedophile activism encompasses opposition against pedophiles, against pedophile advocacy groups, and against other phenomena that are seen as related to pedophilia, such as <a href="child_pornography" title="wikilink">child pornography</a> and <a href="child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">child sexual abuse</a>.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> Much of the direct action classified as anti-pedophile involves demonstrations against sex offenders, against pedophiles advocating for the legalization of sexual activity between adults and children, and against Internet users who solicit sex from minors.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a><a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a><a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a><a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<p>High-profile media attention to pedophilia has led to incidents of <a href="moral_panic" title="wikilink">moral panic</a>, particularly following reports of associated pedophilia associated with <a href="satanic_ritual_abuse" title="wikilink">satanic ritual abuse</a> and <a href="day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria" title="wikilink">day care sex abuse</a>.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Instances of <a href="vigilante" title="wikilink">vigilantism</a> have also been reported in response to public attention on convicted or suspected child sex offenders. In 2000, following a media campaign of &quot;<a href="name_and_shame" title="wikilink">naming and shaming</a>&quot; suspected pedophiles in the UK, hundreds of residents took to the streets in protest against suspected pedophiles, eventually escalating to violent conduct requiring police intervention.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
