<p><strong>Ronald &quot;Ron&quot; Swanson</strong> is a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> played by <a href="Nick_Offerman" title="wikilink">Nick Offerman</a>, in the American comedy television series <em><a href="Parks_and_Recreation" title="wikilink">Parks and Recreation</a></em> on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>. Ron is parks department director in the fictional <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> city of Pawnee and the immediate superior of protagonist <a href="Leslie_Knope" title="wikilink">Leslie Knope</a> (<a href="Amy_Poehler" title="wikilink">Amy Poehler</a>). Despite holding a government job, Ron is a staunch <a href="Libertarianism" title="wikilink">Libertarian</a> who believes in as little government as possible and feels the parks department should not even run or maintain parks.</p>
<p>Ron, who has an extremely <a href="deadpan" class="uri" title="wikilink">deadpan</a> and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, hunting and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both of whom are named <a href="Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Tammy_Swanson" title="wikilink">Tammy</a>, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, <a href="Megan_Mullally" title="wikilink">Megan Mullally</a>. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.</p>
<p>Conceived by series creators <a href="Michael_Schur" title="wikilink">Michael Schur</a> and <a href="Greg_Daniels" title="wikilink">Greg Daniels</a>, Ron has been one of the main characters since the <a href="Pilot_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">pilot episode</a> of <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for <a href="woodworking" class="uri" title="wikilink">woodworking</a>. The traits of the character were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in <a href="Burbank,_California" title="wikilink">Burbank</a>, as well as political appointees of <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a>.</p>
<p>Ron Swanson has received very positive reviews from critics, has developed a <a href="cult_following" title="wikilink">cult following</a> and is widely considered the <a href="breakout_character" title="wikilink">breakout character</a> of the series. Schur has called Ron &quot;our cast <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">MVP</a>.&quot; He has been described by some critics as one of the best characters in a situation comedy in decades, with many comparing his comedic importance to the show to <a href="Cosmo_Kramer" title="wikilink">Cosmo Kramer</a>, despite the two characters having extremely different personalities. His platonic relationship with Leslie has been compared to that of <a href="Mary_Richards" title="wikilink">Mary Richards</a> and <a href="Lou_Grant" title="wikilink">Lou Grant</a> in <em><a href="The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show" title="wikilink">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>. Offerman has received several award nominations for the role, and won the <a href="TCA_Award_for_Individual_Achievement_in_Comedy" title="wikilink">TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy</a>, tying with <a href="Ty_Burrell" title="wikilink">Ty Burrell</a> of <em><a href="Modern_Family" title="wikilink">Modern Family</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="season-one">Season one</h3>
<p>Ron Swanson made his first appearance in the <a href="Pilot_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">pilot episode</a> of <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park because he does not believe the parks department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner <a href="Mark_Brendanawicz" title="wikilink">Mark Brendanawicz</a> (<a href="Paul_Schneider_(actor)" title="wikilink">Paul Schneider</a>) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In a deleted scene from the episode &quot;<a href="Canvassing_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Canvassing</a>&quot;, Ron tries to leave government employment for a previously-offered job at an <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> flower company. However, when he finds that business is now doing extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In the episode &quot;<a href="Boys&#39;_Club_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Boys' Club</a>&quot;, Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the underage <a href="April_Ludgate" title="wikilink">April Ludgate</a> (<a href="Aubrey_Plaza" title="wikilink">Aubrey Plaza</a>) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her. Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is alluded that he really did so out of respect for Leslie.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

Ron promises he will keep Tom's arrangement a secret. Later, Tom discovers Ron playing the saxophone at a bar in his Duke Silver persona. Tom agrees to keep Ron's secret as well.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Later in the season, when Tom's divorce with Wendy is finalized in &quot;<a href="Tom&#39;s_Divorce" title="wikilink">Tom's Divorce</a>&quot;, Ron politely asks whether Tom would mind if he asked Wendy out himself, and explains, &quot;Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.&quot; Tom outwardly claims to be fine with it but, unbeknownst to Ron, is secretly upset because he actually harbors real romantic feelings for Wendy.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

In fact, Tammy schemed to get Ron to give her the rights to land Leslie plans to turn into a park, so Tammy can build a library branch there instead. During their meeting, Ron and Tammy start loudly arguing, but eventually have passionate sex and get back together. Unable to resist Tammy's charms, Ron asks Leslie to break up with Tammy for him. When Leslie stands up to Tammy in Ron's defense, he is moved by what he describes as the first time any woman has put his needs before her own, and it gives him the strength to finally break up with Tammy.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In &quot;<a href="Hunting_Trip" title="wikilink">Hunting Trip</a>&quot;, Leslie insists that Ron take her and the other female parks department employees on one of his private hunting expeditions at the park ranger cabin. Ron begrudgingly agrees, but is frustrated to learn that Leslie is in fact an excellent hunter who overshadows his own abilities. During this trip, Ron is shot in the back of a head by a stray bullet and, although it is not fatal, he becomes hallucinatory and furious after taking multiple painkillers. He initially accuses Leslie of shooting him based on her desire to prove herself, but later learns it was Tom and that Leslie took the blame because Tom was not licensed and could have been arrested for hunting. Ron is strongly impressed that Leslie defended Tom this way.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>In &quot;<a href="The_Set_Up_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">The Set Up</a>&quot;, a new city-wide effort is implemented to make government officials more accessible to Pawnee residents, an idea which Ron condemns as &quot;my hell&quot;. As a result, he seeks to hire an assistant who will shield him from the public and allow him to continue doing nothing. After interviewing several candidates, he chooses April Ludgate, convinced her constant apathy and negative attitude will suit him perfectly.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Their relationship proves very harmonious until the episode &quot;<a href="94_Meetings" title="wikilink">94 Meetings</a>&quot;, when April accidentally schedules nearly 100 meetings on a single day. April previously kept people who wanted to meet with Ron away by scheduling them for a meeting on March 31, a date she wrongly believed was nonexistent. When March 31 actually comes around, Ron has to enroll help from others in the park department to handle the meetings. He becomes so furious with April that she quits, but Ron later apologizes and hires her back.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

While Leslie is horrified, the anti-government Ron is delighted by the idea.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In the season finale, &quot;<a href="Freddy_Spaghetti" title="wikilink">Freddy Spaghetti</a>&quot;, Ron is assigned to a committee tasked with identifying budget cuts, a job which he enjoys thoroughly.

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>Ron Swanson was created by <em>Parks and Recreation</em> creators <a href="Greg_Daniels" title="wikilink">Greg Daniels</a> and <a href="Michael_Schur" title="wikilink">Michael Schur</a>, although Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that <em>Parks and Recreation</em> co-creator <a href="Michael_Schur" title="wikilink">Michael Schur</a> encountered in <a href="Burbank,_California" title="wikilink">Burbank</a> while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, &quot;I don't really believe in the mission of my job. ...

<p>Many aspects of Ron's character are based on those of Nick Offerman in real life, such as his woodworking abilities;<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Offerman runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Offerman also plays saxophone in real life, just as Ron does, although the <em>Parks and Recreation</em> writers did not know this when they wrote this element of his character.

<p>Ron became more heavily involved in <em>Parks and Recreation</em> storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur with the development of the character.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Schur has described Offerman as a &quot;once-in-a-generation comedic performer&quot;,<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> and &quot;our cast <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">MVP</a>, and in many ways our cast leader&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> He compared Ron to a &quot;19th-century rugged individualist&quot;, and said of creating the character, &quot;A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman.
