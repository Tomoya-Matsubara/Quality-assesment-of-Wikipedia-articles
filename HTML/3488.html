<p>John Smith of Alloa was awarded the building contract.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Robert Cock, along with his four sons, carried out the original <a href="slate" class="uri" title="wikilink">slate</a> work.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The paint work was completed by Thomas Whitehead.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Miller and Drysdale installed the plumbing.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The imitation <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a> ceiling and ornaments around the ventilators were the first work carried out by John Wardhope from Edinburgh.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The <a href="Earl_of_Mar" title="wikilink">Earl of Mar</a> erected at his own expense the ornamental railing around the church.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It was intended that the railing on the north side should be circular, however, due to objections to its planned projection being too far into the centre of the road it was kept parallel to the road.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="foundation_stone" title="wikilink">foundation stone</a> was laid on 24 February 1817<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and the church opened on 20 June 1819<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> with a capacity of 1561 seats.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> There were 200 fewer seats than originally planned due to space taken up by the <a href="choir" class="uri" title="wikilink">choir</a> and <a href="Pipe_organ" title="wikilink">organ</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> It is thought that around 2500 people attended the church opening<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> which was more than half of the population of the town - at that time, the population of Alloa would only have been around 4000.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The first child to be <a href="baptise" title="wikilink">baptised</a> after opening was John Francis Erskine, son of Mr. Robert Hutton.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> To commemorate the occasion, the <a href="Earl_of_Mar" title="wikilink">Earl of Mar</a> presented Mr. Hutton with a silver cup bearing an inscription.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> It was 1825 before the bell and clock were added.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In the late 1830s, records show that the church had 2698 members from 766 families.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Only two years after opening for worship, <a href="dry_rot" title="wikilink">dry rot</a> was already spreading rapidly throughout the interior of the church.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The architect recommended that the space under the seats be filled with gravel and broken stone as well as paving the whole of the ground floor.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> This was carried out in 1824 except in the middle section of the church which was not infected.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Further expensive schemes of interior improvement were carried out in 1895 and 1923 with little success since they left the existing interior largely unaltered.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The church was noted as &quot;lacking few pretensions to beauty&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1931, a legacy of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 was bequeathed to the church and, in recognition of the need for more modern and comfortable seating, the <a href="Kirk_Session" title="wikilink">Kirk Session</a> decided upon major reconstruction of the church interior.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It was 1934 before the Session instructed architect <a href="http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200832">Leslie Grahame Thomson MacDougall</a> to prepare plans for the reconstruction, which were duly presented to the congregation at an estimated cost of around &lt;U+00A3&gt;13,000 and subsequently approved.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The Baird Trustees generously promised &lt;U+00A3&gt;1200 towards the cost and a Church Interior Reconstruction Fund was established.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Lady collectors visited homes month by month to collect money for the fund.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Within two years, sufficient funds were raised from the monthly collections to allow the work to begin on 6 December 1936 and the church reopened on 16 October 1937.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>During the first phase of the reconstruction, the galleries were removed and the interior of the church was significantly brightened.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> A new entrance porch took the place of the old <a href="vestibule_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vestibule</a> and allowed additional seating.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The roof was found to be in serious disrepair and was entirely reconditioned with the plaster ceiling replaced by a panelled and embossed wooden design.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The floor was also replaced and a new heating system installed along with pendant lanterns.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Records show that a new pulpit, font and lectern were also gifted and installed during this first phase of the reconstruction.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> At the same time, a Minister's chair and an acousticon earphone installation were also gifted.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> A second phase of reconstruction was planned which was to include a new <a href="chancel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chancel</a>, <a href="Vestry" title="wikilink">vestries</a> and <a href="session_house" title="wikilink">session house</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> However, it was not until 1967 that the alterations to the chancel and other improvements, including the addition of a choir room and session house, were undertaken to the same architect&lt;U+2019&gt;s plans.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The current church has several <a href="stained_glass_window" title="wikilink">stained glass windows</a> that were installed as <a href="memorials" class="uri" title="wikilink">memorials</a>.

In 1991, a memorial window (Fisher of Men) was installed and dedicated to Peter Phillip Brodie, former minister of the church (1947 - 1986) and <a href="Moderator_of_the_General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</a> (1978 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1979).<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
