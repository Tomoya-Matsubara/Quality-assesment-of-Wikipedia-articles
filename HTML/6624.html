<p>The <strong>rights</strong> of <strong><a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a></strong> (<a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a>, <a href="gay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gay</a>, <a href="bisexuality" title="wikilink">bisexual</a> and <a href="transgender" class="uri" title="wikilink">transgender</a>) people in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> have evolved over time. LGBT rights were non-existent at the time of the formation of the United Kingdom, but have increasingly strengthened in support since the decriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity between the middle to late 20th century.</p>
<p>LGBT citizens in the United Kingdom have most of the same legal rights as non-LGBT citizens, and they are extended more legal rights than many other territories worldwide. Discrimination on the basis of both <a href="sexual_orientation" title="wikilink">sexual orientation</a> and <a href="gender_identity" title="wikilink">gender identity</a> is illegal in housing, employment and the provision of goods and services while <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">Her Majesty's Armed Forces</a> allows LGBT individuals to serve openly. In 2001, the <a href="age_of_consent" title="wikilink">age of consent</a> was equalised to 16 under the <a href="Sexual_Offences_(Amendment)_Act_2000" title="wikilink">Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000</a>, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Same-sex couples have had the right to <a href="LGBT_adoption" title="wikilink">adopt</a> since 2002 and to enter into <a href="civil_partnerships" title="wikilink">civil partnerships</a> since 2005. The <a href="Gender_Recognition_Act_2004" title="wikilink">Gender Recognition Act</a> also gave <a href="transsexual" title="wikilink">transsexuals</a> the right to change their legal gender. On 16 September 2011, the UK Government announced plans to start a consultation on Same-Sex Civil Marriage, with the remit of the Consultation to be to examine <strong>how</strong> this can be introduced, rather than whether it should be introduced.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As a result of this consultation, Same-Sex Civil Marriage will be legal in the United Kingdom by the <a href="Next_United_Kingdom_general_election" title="wikilink">2015 General Election</a>.</p>
<p>Social attitudes towards the LGBT community in the United Kingdom are generally accepting. A 2007 survey conducted by <a href="YouGov" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouGov</a> indicated that 90% of the British public supported outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and a 2009 poll by <a href="Populus_Ltd" title="wikilink">Populus</a> reported that 61% supports allowing same-sex couples to marry.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A 2010 Integrated Household Survey (IHS), an experimental survey in a testing phase, estimated that 1.5% of Britons identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual &lt;U+2013&gt; far lower than previous estimates of 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7%.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Interpreting the statistics, an ONS spokeswoman said, &quot;Someone may engage in sexual behaviour with someone of the same sex but still not perceive themselves as gay.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history-in-england-and-wales">History in England and Wales</h2>
<p>At the time of the <a href="Acts_of_Union_1707" title="wikilink">formation of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="English_law" title="wikilink">English law</a> identified <a href="anal_sex" title="wikilink">anal sex</a> and <a href="zoophilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">zoophilia</a> as offences punishable by hanging, as a result of the <a href="Buggery_Act_1533" title="wikilink">Buggery Act 1533</a>. In 1861, section 61 of the <a href="Offences_against_the_Person_Act_1861" title="wikilink">Offences against the Person Act 1861</a> removed the death penalty for homosexuality. However, male homosexual acts still remained illegal and were punishable by imprisonment and in 1885, section 11 of the <a href="Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885" title="wikilink">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a> extended the laws regarding homosexuality to include any kind of sexual activity between males. Conversely, lesbians were never acknowledged or targeted by legislation.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, the police actively enforced laws prohibiting sexual behaviour between men. This policy led to a number of high-profile arrests and trials. One of those involved the noted scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker <a href="Alan_Turing" title="wikilink">Alan Turing</a> (1912&lt;U+2013&gt;1954), convicted in 1952 of &quot;gross indecency&quot;. In 2009, Prime Minister <a href="Gordon_Brown" title="wikilink">Gordon Brown</a>, in response to a petition,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> issued an apology.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1953, <a href="Michael_Pitt-Rivers" title="wikilink">Michael Pitt-Rivers</a> and <a href="Peter_Wildeblood" title="wikilink">Peter Wildeblood</a> were arrested and charged with having committed specific acts of &quot;indecency&quot; with Edward McNally and John Reynolds; they were also accused of conspiring with <a href="Edward_Douglas-Scott-Montagu,_3rd_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu" title="wikilink">Edward Montagu</a> (the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu) to commit these offences. The <a href="Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" title="wikilink">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> gave his assurance that Reynolds and McNally would not be prosecuted in any circumstances. The trial of Edward Montagu, Michael Pitt-Rivers and Peter Wildeblood began on 15 March 1954 in the hall of <a href="Winchester_Castle" title="wikilink">Winchester Castle</a>. All three defendants were convicted. The <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times_(UK)" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em> published an article entitled &quot;Law and Hypocrisy&quot; on 28 March 1954 that dealt with this trial and its outcome. Soon after, on 10 April 1954, the <em><a href="New_Statesman" title="wikilink">New Statesman</a></em> printed an article called &quot;The Police and the Montagu Case&quot;. A month after the Montagu trial the <a href="Home_Secretary" title="wikilink">Home Secretary</a> <a href="David_Maxwell_Fyfe,_1st_Earl_of_Kilmuir" title="wikilink">Sir David Maxwell Fyfe</a> agreed to appoint a committee to examine and report on the law covering homosexual offences. The official announcement in the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> was made on 18 April 1954 by Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth. In August 1954, the <a href="Home_Office" title="wikilink">Home Office</a> appointed a departmental committee of fifteen men and women &quot;to consider... the law and practice relating to homosexual offences and the treatment of persons convicted of such offences by the courts.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution</em> (better known as the <a href="Wolfenden_Report" title="wikilink">Wolfenden Report</a>) was published on 3 September 1957 and recommended that &quot;homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence&quot;, finding that &quot;homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects.&quot; In October 1957, the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, Dr. <a href="Geoffrey_Fisher" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Fisher</a>, spoke in support of the Wolfenden Report, saying that &quot;There is a sacred realm of privacy... into which the law, generally speaking, must not intrude. This is a principle of the utmost importance for the preservation of human freedom, self-respect, and responsibility.&quot; The first parliamentary debate on the Wolfenden Report was initiated on 4 December 1957 by <a href="Frank_Pakenham,_7th_Earl_of_Longford" title="wikilink">Lord Pakenham</a>. Of the seventeen peers who spoke in the debate, eight broadly supported the recommendations in the Wolfenden Report. Maxwell Fyfe, now ennobled as Lord Kilmuir and serving as <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, speaking for the government, doubted that there would be much public support for implementing the recommendations and stated that further research was required. The <a href="Homosexual_Law_Reform_Society" title="wikilink">Homosexual Law Reform Society</a> was founded on 12 May 1958, mainly to campaign for the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="decriminalisation-of-homosexual-acts-the-1967-act">Decriminalisation of homosexual acts: The 1967 Act</h3>
<p>In 1965, in the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Arran" title="wikilink">Lord Arran</a> proposed the decriminalisation of male homosexual acts (lesbian acts had never been illegal). In 1966 <a href="Humphry_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Humphry Berkeley</a> made a similar proposal in the House of Commons; he ascribed his defeat in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1966" title="wikilink">1966 general election</a> to the unpopularity of this action. However, in the new Parliament, <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a> MP <a href="Leo_Abse" title="wikilink">Leo Abse</a> took up the issue and used his mastery of Parliamentary tactics to ensure that the Bill progressed.</p>
<p>After almost ten years of campaigning, the Sexual Offences Bill was put before parliament in 1967 in order to implement some of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations. Lord Arran, a sponsor of the Bill, made the following remarks at the third reading in the Lords:</p>

<p>The <a href="Sexual_Offences_Act_1967" title="wikilink">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a> was accordingly passed. It maintained the general prohibitions on <a href="buggery" class="uri" title="wikilink">buggery</a> and <a href="Decency" title="wikilink">indecency</a> between men, but provided for a limited decriminalisation of homosexual acts where three conditions were fulfilled. Those conditions were that the act had to be consensual, take place in private and involve only people that had attained the age of 21. This was a higher age of consent than that for <a href="heterosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">heterosexual</a> acts, which was set at 16. Further, &quot;in private&quot; limited participation in an act to two people. This condition was interpreted strictly by the courts, which took it to exclude acts taking place in a room in a hotel, for example, and in private homes where a third person was present (even if that person was in a different room).</p>
<p>The 1967 Act extended only to <a href="England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">England and Wales</a>, and not to <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>, the <a href="Channel_Islands" title="wikilink">Channel Islands</a> or the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a>, where all homosexual behaviour remained illegal. Organisations such as the <a href="Campaign_for_Homosexual_Equality" title="wikilink">Campaign for Homosexual Equality</a> and the <a href="Gay_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">Gay Liberation Front</a> therefore continued to campaign for the goal of full equality.</p>
<h2 id="u20131994-further-reform-and-section-28">1967&lt;U+2013&gt;1994: Further reform and Section 28</h2>
<p>In 1979, the Home Office Policy Advisory Committee's Working Party report, <em>Age of Consent in Relation to Sexual Offences</em>, recommended that the age of consent for homosexual activities should be reduced to 18. No such legislation was enacted as a result. However, homosexual activities were legalised in Scotland on the same basis as in the 1967 Act, by section 80 of the <a href="Criminal_Justice_(Scotland)_Act_1980" title="wikilink">Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980</a>, which came into force on 1 February 1981. An analogous amendment was also made to the law of Northern Ireland, following the determination of a case by the <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a> (see <em><a href="Dudgeon_v._United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Dudgeon v. United Kingdom</a></em>); the relevant legislation was an <a href="Order_in_Council" title="wikilink">Order in Council</a>, the <a href="Homosexual_Offences_(Northern_Ireland)_Order_1982" title="wikilink">Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> which came into force on 8 December 1982.</p>
<h3 id="section-28">Section 28</h3>

<p>The 1980s also saw a setback for LGBT rights. The availability in the <a href="library" title="wikilink">libraries</a> of schools run by the <a href="Inner_London_Education_Authority" title="wikilink">Inner London Education Authority</a> of a book considered by some to 'promote' homosexuality led to protests and a campaign for new legislation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Consequently, in 1988, the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1988" title="wikilink">Local Government Act</a> included a provision prohibiting &quot;the intentional promotion of homosexuality&quot; by any <a href="Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">local authority</a> and &quot;the teaching in any <a href="state_school" title="wikilink">maintained school</a> of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;. The provision was known as <a href="Section_28" title="wikilink">Section 28</a>, and amended section 2A of the earlier Local Government Act of 1986. Changes in the structure of local government since that date led to some confusion over the precise circumstances in which the new law applied, including the question of whether or not it applied at all in state schools. Section 28 was finally repealed by the <a href="Uk_labour_party" title="wikilink">Labour</a> government in November 2003. In June 2009, <a href="David_cameron" title="wikilink">David Cameron</a> then leader of the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> Party, formally apologised for his party introducing the law, stating that it was a mistake and had been offensive to gay people.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="military-service">Military service</h2>


<p>The United Kingdom's policy is to allow <a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> men, <a href="lesbians" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbians</a> and <a href="transgender" class="uri" title="wikilink">transgender</a> personnel to <a href="Sexual_orientation_and_military_service#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">serve openly</a>, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to <a href="Coming_out" title="wikilink">come out</a>. All personnel are subject to the same rules against <a href="sexual_harrassment" title="wikilink">sexual harrassment</a>, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The British military actively recruits gay men and lesbians, all three services have deployed recruiting teams to <a href="gay_pride" title="wikilink">gay pride</a> events, and punishes any instance of intolerance or bullying. The <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> advertises for recruits in gay magazines and has allowed gay sailors to hold civil partnership ceremonies on board ships and, since 2006, to march in full naval uniform at <a href="gay_pride" title="wikilink">gay pride</a> marches. <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> and <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> personnel could march but had to wear civilian clothes until 2008, now all military personnel are permitted to attend such marches in uniform.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The current policy was accepted at the lower ranks first, with many senior officers worrying for their troops without a modern acceptance of homosexuality that their personnel had grown up with, one <a href="Brigadier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brigadier</a> resigned but with little impact. Since the change support at the senior level has grown. General Sir <a href="Richard_Dannatt,_Baron_Dannatt" title="wikilink">Richard Dannatt</a>, the <a href="Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Chief of the General Staff</a> (head of the Army), told members of the Army-sponsored Fourth Joint Conference on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transexual Matters that homosexuals were welcome to serve in the Army. In a speech to the conference in 2008, the first of its kind by any Army chief, General Sir Richard said that respect for gays, lesbian, bi-sexual and transsexual officers and soldiers was now &quot;a command responsibility&quot; and was vital for &quot;operational effectiveness&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> requires all soldiers to undergo Equality and Diversity<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> training as part of their Military Annual Training Tests and stress tolerance, specifically citing <a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> examples in training videos, in line with the British Army Core Values<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and Standards,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> including 'Respect for Others' and 'Appropriate Behaviour'. It considers its Core Values and standards as central to being a professional soldier.</p>
<p>The British Military recognises <a href="civil_partnerships" title="wikilink">civil partnerships</a> and grants gay couples the same rights to allowances and housing as straight couples. The <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a> stated &quot;We're pleased personnel registered in a same sex relationship now have equal rights to married couples.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the change of law that permitted homosexuality in the Armed Forces, newspapers reported that the lifting of the ban had had no perceivable impact on the operational effectiveness on the military. The anniversary was widely celebrated, including in the Army's in house publication <em>Soldier Magazine</em>, with a series of articles including the July 2009 cover story and newspapers articles.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="an-equal-age-of-consent">An equal age of consent</h2>

<p>In February 1994 Parliament considered reform of the law on <a href="rape" class="uri" title="wikilink">rape</a> and other sexual offences during the passage of the <em>Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill</em>. On 21 February, <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> MP <a href="Edwina_Currie" title="wikilink">Edwina Currie</a> tabled an amendment to equalise the <a href="age_of_consent" title="wikilink">age of consent</a> at 16. Many Labour MPs supported the amendment, including <a href="Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">Tony Blair</a>, who said:</p>

<p>Edwina Currie's amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 280. Those who voted for it included <a href="John_Smith_(UK_politician)" title="wikilink">John Smith</a>, <a href="Neil_Kinnock" title="wikilink">Neil Kinnock</a>, <a href="Paddy_Ashdown" title="wikilink">Paddy Ashdown</a> and <a href="William_Hague" title="wikilink">William Hague</a>. Those voting against included <a href="David_Blunkett" title="wikilink">David Blunkett</a> and <a href="Ann_Taylor,_Baroness_Taylor_of_Bolton" title="wikilink">Ann Taylor</a>. There were angry scenes outside the <a href="Palace_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Palace of Westminster</a> at the defeat of the amendment, when those involved in a demonstration organised by the group <a href="OutRage!" class="uri" title="wikilink">OutRage!</a> clashed with police.</p>
<p>This vote was followed immediately by one on Sir <a href="Anthony_Durant" title="wikilink">Anthony Durant</a>'s amendment to lower the age of consent to 18. This amendment was passed by 427 votes to 162, and supporters included <a href="Michael_Howard" title="wikilink">Michael Howard</a> and <a href="John_Major" title="wikilink">John Major</a>. It was opposed by such MPs as <a href="John_Redwood" title="wikilink">John Redwood</a>, <a href="Michael_Heseltine" title="wikilink">Michael Heseltine</a> and <a href="John_Gummer" title="wikilink">John Gummer</a>. An amendment tabled by <a href="Simon_Hughes" title="wikilink">Simon Hughes</a> which was intended to equalise the age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals at 17 was not voted upon. The Bill as a whole was given a second reading in the Lords by 290 votes to 247. <a href="Frank_Pakenham" title="wikilink">Lord Longford</a> then sought to reintroduce 21 as the minimum age in the Lords, but this was defeated by 176 votes to 113. An amendment by the deputy Labour leader in the House of Lords, Lord MacIntosh of Haringey, that would have equalised the age of consent at 16, was rejected by 245 votes to 71.</p>
<p>In its decision of 1 July 1997 in the case of <em><a href="Sutherland_v._United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Sutherland v. United Kingdom</a></em>, the <a href="European_Commission_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Commission of Human Rights</a> found that Articles 8 and 14 of the <a href="European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Convention on Human Rights</a> were violated by a discriminatory age of consent, on the ground that there was no objective and reasonable justification for maintaining a higher minimum age for male homosexual acts. On 13 October 1997 the Government submitted to the European Court of Human Rights that it would in the summer of 1998 propose a Bill to Parliament for a reduction of the age of consent for homosexual acts from 18 to 16.</p>
<p>On 22 June 1998, the <em>Crime and Disorder Bill</em> was put before Parliament. <a href="Ann_Keen" title="wikilink">Ann Keen</a> proposed amendments to lower the age of consent to 16. The House of Commons accepted these provisions with a majority of 207, but they were rejected by the House of Lords with a majority of 168. Subsequently, the <em>Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill</em> was introduced on 16 December 1998 and, again, the equalisation of the age of consent was endorsed on 25 January 1999 by the House of Commons, but was rejected on 14 April 1999 by the House of Lords.</p>
<p>Those campaigning against the amendment said they were simply acting to protect children. <a href="Janet_Young,_Baroness_Young" title="wikilink">Baroness Young</a>, the leader of the campaign against the amendment, said, &quot;Homosexual practices carry great health risks to young people&quot;.</p>
<p>The Government reintroduced the Bill in 1999. With the prospect of it being passed by the Commons in two successive sessions of Parliament, the <a href="Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949" title="wikilink">Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949</a> were available to enact the Bill should the Lords have rejected it a third time. The Lords passed the Bill at <a href="Second_Reading" title="wikilink">Second Reading</a>, but made an amendment during committee stage to maintain the age of consent for buggery at 18 for both sexes. As the Bill had not completed its passage through the Lords at the end of the Parliamentary session on 30 November 2000, the <a href="Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Commons</a> <a href="Michael_Martin_(politician)" title="wikilink">Michael Martin</a> certified that the procedure specified by the Parliament Acts had been complied with. The Bill received <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a> a few hours later, and was enacted as the <a href="Sexual_Offences_(Amendment)_Act_2000" title="wikilink">Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000</a>. The provisions of the Act came into force throughout the United Kingdom on 8 January 2001.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="u2013present-day">2000&lt;U+2013&gt;present day</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Adoption_and_Children_Act_2002" title="wikilink">Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> Parliament provided that an application to adopt a child in England and Wales could be made by either a single person or a couple. The previous condition that the couple be married was dropped, thus allowing a same-sex couple to apply. The Lords rejected the proposal on one occasion before it was passed. Supporters of the move in Parliament stressed that adoption was not a &quot;gay rights&quot; issue but one of providing as many children as possible with a stable family environment rather than seeing them kept in care. Opponents raised doubts over the stability of relationships outside marriage, and how instability would impact on the welfare of adopted children. Similar legislation was adopted in Scotland which came into effect on 28 September 2009.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Section 28 (called Section 2A in Scotland) was repealed in Scotland within the first two years of the existence of the <a href="Scottish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Scottish Parliament</a>, by the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A move to remove the provision in England and Wales was prevented following opposition in the House of Lords, again led by the Baroness Young. Following her death in 2002 it was finally repealed in a new <a href="Local_Government_Act_2003" title="wikilink">Local Government Act</a>, which took effect on 18 November 2003. During the passage of the Bill no attempt was made to retain the section, and an amendment seeking to preserve it using ballots was defeated in the House of Lords. This showed that a significant shift had taken place in the consideration of LGBT issues.</p>
<p>Following the adoption of <a href="Directive_establishing_a_general_framework_for_equal_treatment_in_employment_and_occupation" title="wikilink">an EC Directive</a> in 2000, <a href="Employment_Equality_(Sexual_Orientation)_Regulations_2003" title="wikilink">regulations were introduced</a> on 1 December 2003 providing for the prohibition of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 May 2004 the <a href="Sexual_Offences_Act_2003" title="wikilink">Sexual Offences Act 2003</a> entered into force. It swept away all of the previous sex-specific legislation, including the 1967 Act, and introduced instead neutral offences. Thus the previous conditions relating to privacy were removed, and sexual acts were viewed by the law without regard to the sex of the participants.</p>
<p>Parliament then went on to legislate for <a href="Civil_partnerships_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">civil partnerships</a> for same-sex couples on 18 November 2004 with the passage of the <a href="Civil_Partnership_Act_2004" title="wikilink">Civil Partnership Act</a>. Such partnerships were civil unions, granting to the parties the same rights as a marriage. The first civil partnership ceremony took place at 11:00 (GMT) on 5 December 2005 between Matthew Roche and Christopher Cramp at St Barnabas Hospice, <a href="Worthing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worthing</a>, <a href="West_Sussex" title="wikilink">West Sussex</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The usual 14 day waiting period was waived as Roche was suffering from a terminal illness.

<p>On 30 April 2007, the <a href="Equality_Act_(Sexual_Orientation)_Regulations" title="wikilink">Sexual Orientation Regulations</a> came into force, following the introduction of similar provisions in Northern Ireland in 2006. They provided a general prohibition of discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation. Similar legislation had long previously been in force in respect of discrimination on the grounds of <a href="Sex_Discrimination_Act_1975" title="wikilink">sex</a>, <a href="Race_Relations_Act_1976" title="wikilink">race</a>, <a href="Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995" title="wikilink">disability</a> and <a href="marital_status" title="wikilink">marital status</a>. The introduction of the Regulations was controversial and a dispute arose between the Government and the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales</a> over exemptions for Catholic adoption agencies.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Archbishop <a href="Vincent_Nichols" title="wikilink">Vincent Nichols</a> of Birmingham declared his opposition to the act, saying that the legislation contradicted the Catholic Church's &quot;moral values&quot;. He supported efforts to have Catholic <a href="adoption" class="uri" title="wikilink">adoption</a> agencies exempted from sexual orientation regulations, which were ultimately successful in a judgement given on 17 March 2010.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 2007, the Government announced that it would seek to introduce an amendment to the <em>Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill</em> to create a new offence of incitement to hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This followed the creation of an offence on religious hatred that had proved controversial in 2006 (see <a href="Racial_and_Religious_Hatred_Act_2006" title="wikilink">Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006</a>). Incitement to hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation is already illegal in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The <a href="Equality_Act_2010" title="wikilink">Equality Act 2010</a> received <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a> on 8 April 2010.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The primary purpose of the Act was to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of <a href="anti-discrimination_law" title="wikilink">anti-discrimination law</a> in the United Kingdom including the <a href="Equal_Pay_Act_1970" title="wikilink">Equal Pay Act 1970</a>, the <a href="Sex_Discrimination_Act_1975" title="wikilink">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</a>, the <a href="Race_Relations_Act_1976" title="wikilink">Race Relations Act 1976</a>, the <a href="Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995" title="wikilink">Disability Discrimination Act 1995</a> and three major <a href="statutory_instruments" title="wikilink">statutory instruments</a> protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of <a href="Employment_Equality_(Religion_or_Belief)_Regulations_2003" title="wikilink">religion or belief</a>, <a href="Employment_Equality_(Sexual_Orientation)_Regulations_2003" title="wikilink">sexual orientation</a> and <a href="Employment_Equality_(Age)_Regulations_2006" title="wikilink">age</a>.

<p>An illustration of social attitudes towards homosexuality in the United Kingdom was provided in May 2007 in a survey by YouGov. The poll indicated that legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation was supported by 90% of UK citizens. It also showed positive public perceptions of gay people in particular, but recognised the extent to which prejudice still exists.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A poll in June 2009 conducted by Populus for <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> reported that the majority of the public supports same-sex marriage; 61% of respondents agreed that &quot;Gay couples should have an equal right to get married, not just to have civil partnerships&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This positive change means that, for the first time, female couples who have a child using fertility treatment have the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration. It is vital that we afford equality wherever we can in society, especially as family circumstances continue to change.

<h2 id="controversy-over-conversion-therapy">Controversy over conversion therapy</h2>
<p>Peel, Clarke and Drescher wrote in 2007 that only one organisation in the UK could be identified with conversion therapy, a religious organisation called The Freedom Trust<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> (part of <a href="Exodus_International" title="wikilink">Exodus International</a>): &quot;whereas a number of organisations in the US (both religious and scientific/psychological) promote conversion therapy, there is only one in the UK of which we are aware&quot;. The paper reported that practitioners who did provide these sorts of treatments between the 1950s and 1970s now view homosexuality as healthy, and the evidence suggests that 'conversion therapy' is a historical rather than a contemporary phenomenon in the UK, where treatment for homosexuality has always been less common than in the USA.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, the <a href="Royal_College_of_Psychiatrists" title="wikilink">Royal College of Psychiatrists</a>, the main professional organization of psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, issued a report stating that: &quot;Evidence shows that LGB people are open to seeking help for mental health problems. However, they may be misunderstood by therapists who regard their homosexuality as the root cause of any presenting problem such as depression or anxiety. Unfortunately, therapists who behave in this way are likely to cause considerable distress. A small minority of therapists will even go so far as to attempt to change their client's sexual orientation. This can be deeply damaging. Although there are now a number of therapists and organisation in the USA and in the UK that claim that therapy can help homosexuals to become heterosexual, there is no evidence that such change is possible.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, the Royal College of Psychiatrists stated: &quot;The Royal College shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the <a href="National_Association_for_Research_and_Therapy_of_Homosexuality" title="wikilink">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, a research survey into mental health practitioners in the UK concluded &quot;A significant minority of mental health professionals are attempting to help lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to become heterosexual. Given lack of evidence for the efficacy of such treatments, this is likely to be unwise or even harmful.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Scientific American reported on this: &quot;One in 25 British psychiatrists and psychologists say they would be willing to help homosexual and bisexual patients try to convert to heterosexuality, even though there is no compelling scientific evidence a person can willfully become straight&quot;, and explained that 17% of those surveyed said they had tried to help reduce or suppress homosexual feelings, and 4% said they would try to help homosexual people convert to heterosexuality in the future.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
