<p>Owen and his family then moved to Brisbane, where he was &quot;a bit lonely&quot; and &quot;just sat around in my room playing guitar&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He formed a group with a saxophone player from music class at secondary school. Another group was OME (aka Original Music Ensemble), which was an improvisation group &lt;U+2013&gt; most of his early playing was in musical theatre and jazz.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He was also in Fabulous Dingo Family, co-founded by jazz composer David Pyle, and named after <a href="Death_of_Azaria_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Azaria Chamberlain</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Owen's earliest recorded work was for Meera Atkinson, a performance poet, on her album, <em>This Is the Planet</em> (1987), which was produced by <a href="Rob_Younger" title="wikilink">Rob Younger</a> (<a href="Died_Pretty" title="wikilink">Died Pretty</a>, <a href="Lime_Spiders" title="wikilink">Lime Spiders</a>, <a href="The_Stems" title="wikilink">The Stems</a>).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Other session musicians included Brett Myers, <a href="Ron_Peno" title="wikilink">Ron Peno</a>, and <a href="Louis_Tillett" title="wikilink">Louis Tillett</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> By February 1987 Owen was invited by Younger to join a reformed version of <a href="The_New_Christs" title="wikilink">The New Christs</a> on lead guitar.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> With Younger on lead vocals, the line-up also had Jim Dickson (ex-Railroad Gin, Survivors, Passengers, Barracudas) on bass guitar and Louis Burdett (ex-Powerhouse, Ed Kuepper Band) on drums.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Owen co-wrote their fourth single, &quot;Another Sin&quot; (June 1989), with Dickson, Younger and Nick Fisher (ex-Wet Taxis)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; Burdett's replacement.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>During 1987 Owen also provided guitar, with Burdett on drums, for Louis Tillett's (ex-Wet Taxis) debut solo album, <em>Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell</em> (November).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Also on the album were Penny Ikinger on guitar and Diane Spence on saxophone (both from Wet Taxis); and Lenny Bastiaans on bass guitar (Great White Noise).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Stuart_Coupe" title="wikilink">Stuart Coupe</a> from <em><a href="The_Canberra_Times" title="wikilink">The Canberra Times</a></em> described the album as &quot;a wonderful mixture of jazz, blues and rock'n'roll. Above all it's a spirited, passionate and diverse performance from a little known figure on the fringes of the rock'n'roll scene&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Owen also worked with Tillett in the group, Paris Green, which &quot;covered material ranging from Mose Allison to John Coltrane, Ray Charles to Nina Simone, and on any given night there was as many as nine or ten musicians on stage&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In June 1988 Owen was the record producer for <a href="The_Plunderers_(band)" title="wikilink">The Plunderers</a> five-track extended play, <em>Trust Us</em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As a member of New Christs, Owen supplied guitar, piano and organ, as well as co-writing, for their debut album, <em><a href="Distemper_(album)" title="wikilink">Distemper</a></em> (August 1989).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Australian musicologist, <a href="Ian_McFarlane" title="wikilink">Ian McFarlane</a>, described the album as &quot;the definitive statement on the band's sound and style. It contained a wealth of powerful tracks&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> However later that year the group disbanded.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Owen completed session work on Penguins on Safari's <em>Normal Soon</em> and Tony Buck's <em>The Shape of Things to Come</em> (both 1989).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Also that year Owen joined ex-<a href="Cold_Chisel" title="wikilink">Cold Chisel</a> pianist and keyboardist, <a href="Don_Walker_(musician)" title="wikilink">Don Walker</a>, in a blues rock band, Catfish; which toured Australia.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 1990 Owen teamed with Tillet again, in Louis Tillett and His Cast of Aspersions, both produced the group's album, <em>A Cast of Aspersions</em> (April).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> McFarlane noted that it was &quot;eclectic set of material driven by Tillett's booming baritone voice and smouldering organ, Owen's jagged guitar lines and the swinging brass arrangements&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Owen resumed work with Catfish, he appeared on their second album, <em>Ruby</em> (October 1991), and toured in support of its release.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Also in 1991 Owen joined <a href="Divinyls" class="uri" title="wikilink">Divinyls</a> on tour promoting their <a href="Divinyls_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled album</a> issued January, Owen played rhythm guitar on <em>Divinyls Live</em> (1991) alongside founding mainstays, <a href="Chrissy_Amphlett" title="wikilink">Chrissy Amphlett</a> on lead vocals and <a href="Mark_McEntee" title="wikilink">Mark McEntee</a> on lead guitar, together with Lee Borkman on keyboards, Jerome Smith on bass guitar, and <a href="Charlie_Drayton" title="wikilink">Charlie Drayton</a> on drums.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p><em>The Canberra Times</em>{{'}} Mike Gee noted that most of the material was written Perkins and/or Walker but &quot;that isn't to overlook Owens' guitar work and his swampy instrumental 'Dead Dog Boogie'&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> McFarlane described the album as a &quot;rootsy collection of acoustic, country-blues songs full of steel guitar and sparse piano&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> While fellow journalists, <a href="John_O&#39;Donnell_(music_journalist)" title="wikilink">John O'Donnell</a>, <a href="Toby_Creswell" title="wikilink">Toby Creswell</a> and <a href="Craig_Mathieson" title="wikilink">Craig Mathieson</a>, listed it in their book, <em><a href="100_Best_Australian_Albums" title="wikilink">100 Best Australian Albums</a></em> (October 2010).<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> They felt it contained &quot;stories plucked from the night or passed along on back verandahs&quot; and that &quot;Dead Dog Boogie&quot; was a &quot;rambunctious, psychedelic country fair instrumental&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 1993 Owen, on dobro, lapsteel, banjo and organ, joined <a href="Maurice_Frawley" title="wikilink">Maurice Frawley and Working Class Ringos</a>, a rootsy country-blues band.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> With Frawley on lead vocals and lead guitar, were Des Hefner (<a href="The_Birthday_Party_(band)" title="wikilink">The Birthday Party</a>, <a href="Slaughtermen_(band)" title="wikilink">The Slaughtermen</a>) on drums, and Shane Walsh on bass guitar.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Walker described the group as &quot;the best after-midnight band in the world&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Owen called them &quot;the bad boys of folk&quot; who played &quot;the most passionate, beautiful, rollicking, cheeky, heartfelt music you could ever hear&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
