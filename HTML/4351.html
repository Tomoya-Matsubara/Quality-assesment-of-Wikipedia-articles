By demonstrating consistency between <a href="Kepler&#39;s_laws_of_planetary_motion" title="wikilink">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a> and this system, he was the first to show that the motion of objects on Earth and of <a href="celestial_mechanics" title="wikilink">celestial</a> bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws. The unifying and predictive power of his laws was central to the <a href="scientific_revolution" title="wikilink">scientific revolution</a>, the advancement of <a href="heliocentrism" class="uri" title="wikilink">heliocentrism</a>, and the broader acceptance of the notion that rational investigation can reveal the inner workings of nature.</p>
<p>In mechanics, Newton also markedly enunciated the principles of <a href="Momentum" title="wikilink">conservation of momentum</a> and <a href="angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a>. In <a href="optics" class="uri" title="wikilink">optics</a>, he invented the <a href="reflecting_telescope" title="wikilink">reflecting telescope</a> and developed a theory of <a href="Color" title="wikilink">colour</a> based on the observation that a <a href="triangular_prism_(optics)" title="wikilink">prism</a> decomposes <a href="white" class="uri" title="wikilink">white</a> <a href="light" class="uri" title="wikilink">light</a> into a <a href="visible_spectrum" title="wikilink">visible spectrum</a>. Newton notably argued that <a href="wave-particle_duality" title="wikilink">light is composed of particles</a>. He also formulated an empirical <a href="Newton&#39;s_law_of_cooling" title="wikilink">law of cooling</a>, studied the <a href="speed_of_sound" title="wikilink">speed of sound</a>, and proposed a theory of the origin of <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a>. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a> for the <a href="history_of_calculus" title="wikilink">development</a> of <a href="calculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">calculus</a>. He also demonstrated the <a href="binomial_theorem" title="wikilink">generalized binomial theorem</a>, developed the so-called &quot;<a href="Newton&#39;s_method" title="wikilink">Newton's method</a>&quot; for approximating the zeroes of a <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a>, and contributed to the study of <a href="power_series" title="wikilink">power series</a>.</p>
<p>French mathematician <a href="Joseph_Louis_Lagrange" title="wikilink">Joseph-Louis Lagrange</a> often said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that he was also &quot;the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> English poet <a href="Alexander_Pope" title="wikilink">Alexander Pope</a> was moved by Newton's accomplishments to write the famous <a href="epitaph" class="uri" title="wikilink">epitaph</a>:  Newton himself was rather more modest of his own achievements, famously writing in a letter to <a href="Robert_Hooke" title="wikilink">Robert Hooke</a> in February <a href="1676" class="uri" title="wikilink">1676</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If I have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of giants&quot;</p>

<p>and then in a memoir later</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Isaac_Newton.jpeg" title="fig:Newton in 1702. Portrait by Godfrey Kneller." alt="Newton in 1702. Portrait by Godfrey Kneller." width="200" /> According to the modern calendar, Isaac Newton was born on January 4<sup>th</sup> <a href="1642" class="uri" title="wikilink">1642</a> at <a href="Woolsthorpe_Manor" title="wikilink">Woolsthorpe Manor</a> in <a href="Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth</a>, a <a href="Hamlet_(place)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> in the county of <a href="Lincolnshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire</a>. At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the latest papal calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as <a href="Christmas_Day" title="wikilink">Christmas Day</a> <a href="1642" class="uri" title="wikilink">1642</a>. Newton was born three months after his father, also called Isaac, died. Born <a href="Premature_birth" title="wikilink">prematurely</a>, he was a small child; his mother <a href="Hannah_Ayscough" title="wikilink">Hannah Ayscough</a> reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. Newton's three months before his birth. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his step-father and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry to the list sins commited up to the age of 19:</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to <a href="Eric_Temple_Bell" title="wikilink">E.T. Bell</a> and H. Eves:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Newton began his schooling in the village schools and was later sent to <a href="The_King&#39;s_School,_Grantham" title="wikilink">The King's School, Grantham</a>, where he became the top boy in the school. At King's, he lodged with the local <a href="apothecary" class="uri" title="wikilink">apothecary</a>, <a href="William_Clarke_(apothecary)" title="wikilink">William Clarke</a> and eventually became engaged to the apothecary's stepdaughter, Anne Storey, before he went off to <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a> at the age of 19. As Newton became engrossed in his studies, the romance cooled and Miss Storey married someone else. It is said he kept a warm memory of this love, but Newton had no other recorded &quot;sweet-hearts&quot; and never married.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, Bell and Eves' sources for this claim, William Stukeley and Mrs. Vincent (the former Miss Storey - actually named Katherine, not Anne), merely say that Newton entertained &quot;a passion&quot; for Storey while he lodged at the Clarke house. From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at <a href="Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth</a>, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to have been Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.</p>
<p>In June 1661, he was admitted to <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Descartes</a> and <a href="astronomers" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomers</a> such as <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo</a>, <a href="Nicolaus_Copernicus" title="wikilink">Copernicus</a> and <a href="Johannes_Kepler" title="wikilink">Kepler</a>. In 1665, he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the <a href="Great_Plague_of_London" title="wikilink">Great Plague</a>. For the next 18 months Newton worked at home on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation.</p>

<h4 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h4>
<p>Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, using their own unique notations. Although Newton had worked out his method years before Leibniz, he published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704. Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Moreover, Leibniz's notation and &quot;differential Method&quot; were universally adopted on the Continent, and after 1820 or so, in the British Empire. Newton claimed that he had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared being mocked for it. Starting in 1699, other members of the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the dispute broke out in full force in 1711. Thus began the bitter <a href="Newton_v._Leibniz_calculus_controversy" title="wikilink">calculus priority dispute</a> with Leibniz, which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716. This dispute created a divide between British and Continental mathematicians that may have retarded the progress of British mathematics by at least a century.</p>
<p>Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered <a href="Newton&#39;s_identities" title="wikilink">Newton's identities</a>, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of <a href="finite_differences" title="wikilink">finite differences</a>, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to <a href="Diophantine_equations" title="wikilink">Diophantine equations</a>. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to <a href="Euler&#39;s_summation_formula" title="wikilink">Euler's summation formula</a>), and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. He also discovered a new formula for <a href="pi" class="uri" title="wikilink">pi</a>.</p>
<p>He was elected <a href="Lucasian_professor" title="wikilink">Lucasian professor</a> of <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> in 1669. In that day, any fellow of Cambridge or <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> had to be an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder <em>not</em> be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a>, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.</p>
<h4 id="optics">Optics</h4>
<p>From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the <a href="refraction" class="uri" title="wikilink">refraction</a> of light, demonstrating that a <a href="Triangular_prism_(optics)" title="wikilink">prism</a> could decompose <a href="White" title="wikilink">white light</a> into a <a href="optical_spectrum" title="wikilink">spectrum</a> of colours, and that a <a href="Lens_(optics)" title="wikilink">lens</a> and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. <img src="NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg" title="fig:A replica of Newton&#39;s 6-inch reflecting telescope of 1672 for the Royal Society." alt="A replica of Newton&#39;s 6-inch reflecting telescope of 1672 for the Royal Society." width="250" /> He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties, by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus the colours we observe are the result of how objects interact with the incident <em>already-coloured</em> light, <strong>not</strong> the result of objects <em>generating</em> the colour. For more details, see <a href="Isaac_Newton&#39;s_early_life_and_achievements#Newton&#39;s_theory_of_colour" title="wikilink">Newton's theory of colour</a>.</p>
<p>From this work he concluded that any refracting <a href="telescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">telescope</a> would suffer from the <a href="dispersion_(optics)" title="wikilink">dispersion</a> of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a <a href="Newtonian_telescope" title="wikilink">Newtonian telescope</a>) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using <a href="Newton&#39;s_rings" title="wikilink">Newton's rings</a> to judge the <a href="quality" class="uri" title="wikilink">quality</a> of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes <em>On Colour</em>, which he later expanded into his <em>Opticks</em>. When <a href="Robert_Hooke" title="wikilink">Robert Hooke</a> criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.</p>
<p>Newton argued that light is composed of particles, but he had to associate them with <a href="wave" title="wikilink">waves</a> to explain the <a href="diffraction" class="uri" title="wikilink">diffraction</a> of light (<em>Opticks</em> Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> restores the idea of &quot;wave-particle duality&quot;, although <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> bear very little resemblance to Newton's <em>corpuscles</em> (e.g., corpuscles refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium).</p>
<p>In his <em>Hypothesis of Light</em> of 1675, Newton <a href="wikt:posit" title="wikilink">posited</a> the existence of the <a href="luminiferous_aether" title="wikilink">ether</a> to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the <a href="theosophist" class="uri" title="wikilink">theosophist</a> <a href="Henry_More" title="wikilink">Henry More</a>, revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on <a href="Hermeticism" title="wikilink">Hermetic</a> ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. <a href="John_Maynard_Keynes" title="wikilink">John Maynard Keynes</a>, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that &quot;Newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> (This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.) Had he not relied on the <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a> idea of <a href="action_at_a_distance_(physics)" title="wikilink">action at a distance</a>, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also <a href="Isaac_Newton&#39;s_occult_studies" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton's occult studies</a>.)</p>
<p>In 1704 Newton wrote <em><a href="Opticks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Opticks</a></em>, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional <a href="electrostatic_generator" title="wikilink">electrostatic generator</a>, using a <a href="glass" class="uri" title="wikilink">glass</a> globe (Optics, 8th Query).</p>
<h4 id="mechanics-and-gravitation">Mechanics and gravitation</h4>
<p><img src="NewtonsPrincipia.jpg" title="fig:Newton&#39;s own copy of his Principia, with hand written corrections for the second edition." alt="Newton&#39;s own copy of his Principia, with hand written corrections for the second edition." width="250" /> </p>
<p>In 1679, Newton returned to his work on mechanics, i.e., gravitation and its effect on the orbits of <a href="planet" title="wikilink">planets</a>, with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and consulting with Hooke and <a href="John_Flamsteed" title="wikilink">Flamsteed</a> on the subject. He published his results in <em>De Motu Corporum</em> (1684). This contained the beginnings of the laws of motion that would inform the <em>Principia</em>.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a></em> (now known as the <em>Principia</em>) was published on <a href="July_5" title="wikilink">July 5</a>, <a href="1687" class="uri" title="wikilink">1687</a> with encouragement and financial help from <a href="Edmond_Halley" title="wikilink">Edmond Halley</a>. In this work Newton stated the <a href="Isaac_Newton#Newton&#39;s_laws_of_motion" title="wikilink">three universal laws of motion</a> that were not to be improved upon for more than two hundred years. He used the Latin word <em>gravitas</em> (weight) for the force that would become known as <a href="gravity" class="uri" title="wikilink">gravity</a>, and defined the law of <a href="universal_gravitation" title="wikilink">universal gravitation</a>. In the same work he presented the first analytical determination, based on <a href="Boyle&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Boyle's law</a>, of the speed of sound in air.</p>
<p>With the <em>Principia</em>, Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the <a href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Swiss</a>-born mathematician <a href="Nicolas_Fatio_de_Duillier" title="wikilink">Nicolas Fatio de Duillier</a>, with whom he formed an intense relationship that lasted until 1693. The end of this friendship led Newton to a <a href="nervous_breakdown" title="wikilink">nervous breakdown</a>.</p>

<p>In the 1690s Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>. Henry More's belief in the universe and rejection of <a href="Cartesian_dualism" title="wikilink">Cartesian dualism</a> may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. A manuscript he sent to <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a> in which he disputed the existence of the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a> was never published. Later works &lt;U+2014&gt; <em>The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</em> (1728) and <em>Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John</em> (1733) &lt;U+2014&gt; were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to alchemy (see above).</p>
<p>Newton was also a member of the <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">Parliament of England</a> from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701, but his only recorded comments were to complain about a cold draft in the chamber and request that the window be closed.</p>
<p>Newton moved to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> to take up the post of warden of the <a href="Royal_Mint" title="wikilink">Royal Mint</a> in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of <a href="Charles_Montagu,_1st_Earl_of_Halifax" title="wikilink">Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax</a>, then <a href="Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Master Lucas (and securing the job of deputy <a href="comptroller" class="uri" title="wikilink">comptroller</a> of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known <a href="Master_of_the_Mint" title="wikilink">Master of the Mint</a> upon Lucas' death in 1699, a position Newton held until his death. These appointments were intended as <a href="sinecure" title="wikilink">sinecures</a>, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish <a href="debasement" title="wikilink">clippers</a> and counterfeiters. As Master of the Mint in <a href="1717" class="uri" title="wikilink">1717</a> Newton unofficially moved the <a href="Pound_Sterling" title="wikilink">Pound Sterling</a> from the <a href="silver_standard" title="wikilink">silver standard</a> to the <a href="gold_standard" title="wikilink">gold standard</a> by creating a relationship between gold coins and the silver penny in the <a href="Anne_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">&quot;Law of Queen Anne&quot;</a>; these were all great reforms at the time, adding considerably to the wealth and stability of England. It was his work at the Mint, rather than his earlier contributions to science, that earned him a <a href="knighthood" class="uri" title="wikilink">knighthood</a> from Queen Anne in 1705. <img src="Isaac_Newton_grave_in_Westminster_Abbey.jpg" title="fig:Newton&#39;s grave in Westminster Abbey" alt="Newton&#39;s grave in Westminster Abbey" /> Newton was made President of the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> in 1703 and an associate of the French <a href="French_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie des Sciences</a>. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the <a href="Astronomer_Royal" title="wikilink">Astronomer Royal</a>, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's star catalogue, which Newton had used in his studies.</p>
<p>Newton died in London on March 20, 1727, and was buried in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>. His half-niece, <a href="Catherine_Barton_Conduitt" title="wikilink">Catherine Barton Conduitt</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on <a href="Jermyn_Street" title="wikilink">Jermyn Street</a> in London; he was her &quot;very loving Uncle&quot;,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> according to his letter to her when she was recovering from <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>. Although Newton, who had no children, had divested much of his estate onto relatives in his last years he actually died <a href="intestate" class="uri" title="wikilink">intestate</a>.</p>
<p>After his death, Newton's body was discovered to have had massive amounts of <a href="Mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a> in it, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. <a href="Mercury_poisoning" title="wikilink">Mercury poisoning</a> could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religious-views">Religious views</h2>


<p>Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>His scientific fame notwithstanding, Newton's study of the Bible and of the early <a href="Church_Fathers" title="wikilink">Church Fathers</a> were among his greatest passions. He devoted more time to the study of the Scriptures, the Fathers, and to <a href="Alchemy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alchemy</a> than to science, and said, &quot;I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by those who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Newton himself wrote works on <a href="textual_criticism" title="wikilink">textual criticism</a>, most notably <em><a href="An_Historical_Account_of_Two_Notable_Corruptions_of_Scripture" title="wikilink">An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture</a></em>. Newton also placed the crucifixion of <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> at <a href="3_April" title="wikilink">3 April</a>, AD 33, which is now the accepted traditional date. He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to find hidden messages within the Bible (See <a href="Bible_code" title="wikilink">Bible code</a>). Despite his focus on <a href="theology" class="uri" title="wikilink">theology</a> and alchemy, Newton tested and investigated these ideas with the <a href="scientific_method" title="wikilink">scientific method</a>, observing, hypothesising, and testing his theories. To Newton, his scientific and religious experiments were one and the same, observing and understanding how the world functioned.</p>
<p>Newton may have rejected the church's doctrine of the Trinity. In a minority view, <a href="T.C._Pfizenmaier" title="wikilink">T.C. Pfizenmaier</a> argues that he more likely held the <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox</a> view of the Trinity rather than the Western one held by <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a>, <a href="Anglican" title="wikilink">Anglicans</a>, and most <a href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestants</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In his own day, he was also accused of being a <a href="Rosicrucianism" title="wikilink">Rosicrucian</a> (as were many in the Royal Society and in the court of Charles II).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In his own lifetime, Newton wrote more on religion than he did on natural science. He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the <a href="hylozoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">hylozoism</a> implicit in Leibniz and <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Baruch Spinoza</a>. Thus, the ordered and dynamically informed <a href="universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">universe</a> could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason, but this universe, to be perfect and ordained, had to be regular.</p>

<p>The attacks made against pre-<a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> &quot;magical thinking,&quot; and the <a href="Christian_mysticism" title="wikilink">mystical elements of Christianity</a>, were given their foundation with Boyle&lt;U+2019&gt;s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle&lt;U+2019&gt;s ideas their completion through <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">mathematical proofs</a> and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed man to pursue his own aims fruitfully in this life, not <a href="afterlife" title="wikilink">the next</a>, and to perfect himself with his own rational powers.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> But the unforeseen <a href="Christian_theology" title="wikilink">theological</a> consequence of his conception of God, as Leibniz pointed out, was that God was now entirely removed from the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s affairs, since the need for intervention would only evidence some imperfection in God&lt;U+2019&gt;s creation, something impossible for a perfect and <a href="omnipotent" class="uri" title="wikilink">omnipotent</a> creator.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Leibniz's <a href="theodicy" class="uri" title="wikilink">theodicy</a> cleared God from the responsibility for <em>&quot;<a href="Problem_of_evil" title="wikilink">l'origine du mal</a>&quot;</em> by making God removed from participation in his creation.

<h2 id="newton-and-the-counterfeiters">Newton and the counterfeiters</h2>
<p>As warden of the royal mint, Newton estimated that 20% of the coins taken in during The <a href="Royal_Mint" title="wikilink">Great Recoinage</a> were <a href="counterfeit" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterfeit</a>. Counterfeiting was <a href="treason" class="uri" title="wikilink">treason</a>, punishable by death by <a href="drawing_and_quartering" title="wikilink">drawing and quartering</a>. Despite this, convictions of the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult to achieve; however, Newton proved to be equal to the task.</p>
<p>He gathered much of that evidence himself, disguised, while he hung out at bars and taverns. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, <a href="English_law" title="wikilink">English law</a> still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton was made a <a href="justice_of_the_peace" title="wikilink">justice of the peace</a> and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699 conducted some 200 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers and suspects. Newton won his convictions and in February 1699, he had ten prisoners waiting to be executed. He later ordered all records of his interrogations to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Possibly Newton's greatest triumph as the king's attorney was against <a href="William_Chaloner" title="wikilink">William Chaloner</a>. One of Chaloner's schemes was to set up phony conspiracies of <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholics</a> and then turn in the hapless conspirators whom he entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton was outraged, and went about the work to uncover anything about Chaloner. During his studies, he found that Chaloner was engaged in counterfeiting. He immediately put Chaloner on trial, but Mr Chaloner had friends in high places, and to Newton's horror, Chaloner walked free. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of <a href="High_treason_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">high treason</a> and <a href="hanged,_drawn_and_quartered" title="wikilink">hanged, drawn and quartered</a> on March 23 1699 at <a href="Tyburn,_London" title="wikilink">Tyburn gallows</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="enlightenment-philosophers">Enlightenment philosophers</h2>
<p><a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&lt;U+2014&gt;Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&lt;U+2014&gt;as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of <a href="Nature" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nature</a> and <a href="Natural_law" title="wikilink">Natural Law</a> to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>It was Newton&lt;U+2019&gt;s conception of the universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became the seed for Enlightenment <a href="ideology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ideology</a>.

<h2 id="newtons-laws-of-motion">Newton's laws of motion</h2>

<p>The famous three laws of motion:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Newton's First Law</em> (also known as the Law of <a href="Inertia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inertia</a>) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.</li>
<li><em>Newton's Second Law</em> states that an applied force, <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>, on an object equals the time rate of change of its momentum, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>. Mathematically, this is written as <span class="math inline">$\vec F = \frac{d\vec p}{dt} \, = \, \frac{d}{dt} (m \vec v) \, = \, \vec v \, \frac{dm}{dt} + m \, \frac{d\vec v}{dt} \,.$</span> Assuming the mass to be constant, the first term vanishes. Defining the acceleration to be <span class="math inline"><em>a⃗</em> = <em>d</em><em>v⃗</em>/<em>d</em><em>t</em></span> results in the famous equation <span class="math inline"><em>F⃗</em> = <em>m</em> <em>a⃗</em> ,</span> which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass. In the MKS system of measurement, mass is given in <a href="kilograms" class="uri" title="wikilink">kilograms</a>, acceleration in metres per second squared, and force in <a href="newton" title="wikilink">newtons</a> (named in his honour).</li>
<li><em>Newton's Third Law</em> states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>

<p>A popular story claims that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree. Cartoons have gone further to suggest the apple actually hit Newton's head, and that its impact somehow made him aware of the force of gravity. John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the royal mint and husband of Newton's niece, described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;.</p>
<p>A contemporary writer, <a href="William_Stukeley" title="wikilink">William Stukeley</a>, recorded in his <em>Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life</em> a conversation with Newton in Kensington on <a href="15_April" title="wikilink">15 April</a> <a href="1726" class="uri" title="wikilink">1726</a>, in which Newton recalled &quot;when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth's centre.&quot; In similar terms, Voltaire wrote in his <em>Essay on Epic Poetry</em> (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.&quot; These accounts are probably exaggerations of Newton's own tale about sitting by a window in his home (<a href="Woolsthorpe_Manor" title="wikilink">Woolsthorpe Manor</a>) and watching an apple fall from a tree.</p>
<p>Various trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later, the staff of the [now] <a href="National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" title="wikilink">National Trust</a>-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there.</p>
