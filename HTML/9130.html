<p><strong>Lawrence Robert Bowa</strong> (born <a href="December_6" title="wikilink">December 6</a> <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a> in <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>) is a former <a href="Infielder" title="wikilink">middle infielder</a>, playing mainly as a <a href="shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">shortstop</a>, and <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a> in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> who played primarily for the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. He is currently the <a href="coach_(baseball)" title="wikilink">third-base coach</a> of the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>.</p>
<p>Characterized by his &quot;soft&quot; hands, strong arm, and fiery personality, he won two <a href="Gold_Glove_Award" title="wikilink">Gold Glove Awards</a> and led the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> in <a href="fielding_percentage" title="wikilink">fielding percentage</a> six times, then a league record. He retired with the NL record for career games at shortstop (2222) and the major league records for fielding average in a career (.980) and a single season (.991, in <a href="1979_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1979</a>), and was also among the career leaders in <a href="assist_(baseball)" title="wikilink">assists</a> (6th, 6857) and <a href="double_play" title="wikilink">double plays</a> (4th, 1265); his records have since been broken, though he retains the NL mark for career fielding average.</p>
<p>Apart from his fielding achievements, he was a switch-hitter, <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting</a> .280 or better four times (.305 in 1975); he also had nine seasons with 20 or more <a href="stolen_base" title="wikilink">stolen bases</a>. From his 1970 rookie season through 1981, Bowa provided solid reliability in the Phillies' infield, along with <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third baseman</a> <a href="Mike_Schmidt" title="wikilink">Mike Schmidt</a>; from 1976 to 1981, the Phillies reached the postseason five times, ending a drought dating back a quarter of a century. Bowa batted .333 in a losing cause in the <a href="1978_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1978 NLCS</a>, but played an even greater role in 1980, hitting .316 in the <a href="1980_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">NLCS</a> and .375 in the <a href="1980_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> as the Phillies captured the first title in franchise history. In 1979, Bowa set a major league record for shortstops with a .991 fielding average; <a href="Tony_Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez" title="wikilink">Tony Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez</a> broke the record with a .992 mark in <a href="1989_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1989</a>, and <a href="Rey_Ord&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez" title="wikilink">Rey Ord&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez</a> broke the NL record with a .994 average in <a href="1999_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1999</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1982, Bowa was traded to the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> along with rookie <a href="Ryne_Sandberg" title="wikilink">Ryne Sandberg</a> in exchange for <a href="Ivan_DeJesus" title="wikilink">Ivan DeJesus</a>, a move made by new Cubs general manager <a href="Dallas_Green" title="wikilink">Dallas Green</a>, who had managed the 1980 Phillies. The trade paid off tremendously for the Cubs, as Bowa's veteran leadership and Sandberg's outstanding all-around play brought the Cubs to the postseason in <a href="1984_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1984</a> for the first time in 39 years. After being released by the Cubs in August 1985, Bowa played briefly for the <a href="New_York_Mets" title="wikilink">New York Mets</a> before retiring. He was a .260 career hitter with 15 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, 525 <a href="run_batted_in" title="wikilink">RBI</a>, 2191 <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a>, 987 <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a>, 262 <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a>, 99 <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a>, and 318 stolen bases in 2247 games. His NL records for career games at shortstop and most years leading the league in fielding were later broken by <a href="Ozzie_Smith" title="wikilink">Ozzie Smith</a>; his major league record for career fielding average has been broken by <a href="Omar_Vizquel" title="wikilink">Omar Vizquel</a>.</p>
<p>After retiring, Bowa was named manager of the <a href="San_Diego_Padres" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a> in <a href="1987_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1987</a>, but his aggressive and often angry style were ineffective, and he was fired a year later. Bowa returned to managing the Phillies in <a href="2001_in_baseball" title="wikilink">2001</a>, and was honored as <a href="Manager_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Manager of the Year</a> after bringing the team within two games of the division title; they had finished in last place in 2000. He was fired with two games remaining in the <a href="2004_in_baseball" title="wikilink">2004</a> season after failing to finish within 10 games of first place in his last three years.</p>
<p>After leaving the Phillies and before accepting his current job with the Yankees, Bowa served as an analyst for <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a>'s <em><a href="Baseball_Tonight" title="wikilink">Baseball Tonight</a></em> and co-hosted a baseball talk show on <a href="XM_Radio" title="wikilink">XM Radio</a>.</p>
<p>His nephew is <a href="Nick_Johnson" title="wikilink">Nick Johnson</a> of the <a href="Washington_Nationals" title="wikilink">Washington Nationals</a>.</p>
