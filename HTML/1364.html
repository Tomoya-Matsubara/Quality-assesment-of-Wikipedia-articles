<p>The <strong>Girl Scouts of the United States of America</strong> (<strong>GSUSA</strong>) is a <a href="youth_organization" title="wikilink">youth organization</a> for girls in the United States and American girls living abroad. It describes itself as &quot;the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was founded by <a href="Juliette_Gordon_Low" title="wikilink">Juliette Gordon Low</a> in 1912 and was organized after Low met <a href="Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Robert Baden-Powell</a>, the founder of <a href="Scouting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scouting</a>, in 1911. Upon returning to <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah, Georgia</a>, she made her historic telephone call to a distant cousin, saying, &quot;I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world, and we're going to start it tonight!&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>GSUSA aims to empower girls and to help teach values such as honesty, fairness, courage, compassion, character, sisterhood, confidence, and <a href="citizenship" class="uri" title="wikilink">citizenship</a> through activities including <a href="camping" class="uri" title="wikilink">camping</a>, <a href="community_service" title="wikilink">community service</a>, learning <a href="first_aid" title="wikilink">first aid</a>, and earning numerous badges by acquiring other practical skills. Girl Scouts' achievements are recognized through rank advancement and by various special awards. Girl Scouts welcomed girls with disabilities early in their history, at a time when they were not included in most other activities.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Membership is organized according to age group with activities designed appropriately for each level. The GSUSA is a member of the <a href="World_Association_of_Girl_Guides_and_Girl_Scouts" title="wikilink">World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts</a> (<a href="WAGGGS" class="uri" title="wikilink">WAGGGS</a>), and has an extensive history of accepting girls from all backgrounds.</p>
<p>In 1994, the <em><a href="Chronicle_of_Philanthropy" title="wikilink">Chronicle of Philanthropy</a></em>, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility conducted by <a href="Nye_Lavalle" title="wikilink">Nye Lavalle</a> &amp; Associates. The study showed that the Girl Scouts was ranked as the 8th &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America&quot; of over 100 charities researched with 41% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A Lot for the Girl Scouts.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

GSUSA is in contact with museums, businesses and organizations to join with the Girl Scouts in showcasing Girl Scouts.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> GSUSA will have celebratory T-shirts and accessories, including jewelry and hats embellished with the 100th Anniversary logo available by mid-2011.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> signed the &quot;Girl Scouts of the USA Commemorative Coin Act&quot; for the 100th Anniversary celebration. The act authorized the minting of 350,000 silver dollar coins in honor of Girl Scouts and the achievements of the 50 million women influenced by Girl Scouting during the last 100 years.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Many exciting plans are in the works for the 100th Anniversary of the founding of Girl Scouts by Juliette Low in 1912. The celebration and showcasing of the Anniversary will be kicked off by participating in the world famous <a href="Pasadena,_California" title="wikilink">Pasadena, California</a> <a href="Rose_Parade" title="wikilink">Rose Parade</a> of 2012, featuring the GSUSA 100th Anniversary float.

<p>The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the <a href="Three-finger_salute_(scouts)" title="wikilink">three middle fingers</a> of the right hand, which forms the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the word &quot;God&quot; may be interpreted depending on individual spiritual beliefs.

<p><img src="Girl_Scout_in_uniform,_1973.JPG" title="fig:Girl Scout in uniform, 1973" alt="Girl Scout in uniform, 1973" width="100" /> Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original khaki and the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Daisy Girl Scouts have the choice of a blue vest or a smock. They have their own &quot;Daisy&quot; Uniform pin and a choice of accessories. Brownies wear the traditional brown vest or sash and the historical &quot; Brownie&quot; pin. Accessories are also available. Junior Girl Scouts wear their official vest or sash to display official insignia and awards, coupled with a white polo shirt and khaki pants or skirt. A large array of accessories are available. Cadette and Senior Girls have the choice of a khaki sash or vest, and the khaki pants or skirt worn with a white shirt. The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Juliette_Gordon_Low_dai.jpg" title="fig:Juliette Gordon Low (center), with two Girl Scouts." alt="Juliette Gordon Low (center), with two Girl Scouts." /> Girl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912 when <a href="Juliette_Gordon_Low" title="wikilink">Juliette &quot;Daisy&quot; Gordon Low</a> organized the first Girl Scout troop meeting of 18 girls in <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. It has since grown 3.7 million members.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Low, who had met <a href="Baden-Powell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baden-Powell</a> in London while she was living in the United Kingdom, dreamed of giving the United States and the world &quot;something for all the girls.&quot; She envisioned an organization that would bring girls out of their sheltered home environments to serve their communities, experience the out-of-doors, and give them the opportunity to develop &quot;self-reliance and resourcefulness.&quot; Unlike other organizations, from its inception, Girl Scouts has been organized and run exlusively by women, for girls and women.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The organization's original name was the Girl Guides of America. In 1913, it was changed to the Girl Scouts of the United States and the organization was incorporated in 1915. The name was finally changed to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America in 1947, and was given a <a href="congressional_charter" title="wikilink">congressional charter</a> on March 16, 1950. The GSUSA started with 18 members &lt;U+2014&gt; within months, members were <a href="hiking" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiking</a> through the woods in their knee-length blue uniforms, playing <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> on a curtained-off court, and going on camping trips. By 1920, there were nearly 70,000 members, and by 1930 over 200,000. In 2005 there were over 3.7 million Girl Scouts &lt;U+2014&gt; 2.8 million girl members and 954,000 adult members &lt;U+2014&gt; in the United States.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> More than 50 million American women have participated in the Girl Scouts. Through its membership in the <a href="WAGGGS" class="uri" title="wikilink">WAGGGS</a>, GSUSA is part of a worldwide scouting family of over 10 million girls and adults in 145 countries.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The names and ages of the <a href="Girl_Scout_levels_(USA)" title="wikilink">levels</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; and the larger structure of the program &lt;U+2014&gt; have evolved significantly. Troops were initially fairly independent before joining together into small councils, which have recently merged into larger councils.</p>
<p>The <a href="Juliette_Gordon_Low_Historic_District#Juliette_Gordon_Low_Birthplace" title="wikilink">Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace</a>, located in Savannah, Georgia in the former Gordon family home, became the National Girl Scout program center in 1956.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> It provides tours to thousands of Girl Scouts yearly. Upon Low's death in 1927, she willed her carriage house, which would eventually become The Girl Scout First Headquarters, to the local Savannah Girl Scouts for continued use.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The first National Headquarters was in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, but it was moved to New York City in the spring of 1916 and has remained there ever since.</p>
<p>The aim of the Girl Scouts is that girls will develop to their full potential by pursuing four goals: developing their full potential; relating to others with increasing understanding, skill, and respect; developing a meaningful set of values to guide their actions and to provide for sound <a href="Decision_making" title="wikilink">decision-making</a>; and contributing to the improvement of society.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

Girl Scout troops were organized, even in these camps. These girls participated in many activities, including dramatic presentations, which took place in the <a href="Crystal_City_Internment_Camp" title="wikilink">Crystal City Internment Camp</a>, located in <a href="Crystal_City,_Texas" title="wikilink">Crystal City, Texas</a>.</p>
<h3 id="desegregation">Desegregation</h3>
<p>Most Girl Scout units were originally <a href="Racial_segregation" title="wikilink">segregated</a> by <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">race</a> according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for African American girls was founded in 1917; the first <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American Indian</a> troop was formed in <a href="New_York_State" title="wikilink">New York State</a> in 1921; and the first troop for <a href="Mexican_Americans" title="wikilink">Mexican Americans</a> was formed in <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a>, in 1922. In 1933, Josephine Groves Holloway founded unofficial African American troops in <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The first official African American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond, Virginia</a> by Lena B.

It first met in Hartshorn Hall, <a href="Virginia_Union_University" title="wikilink">Virginia Union University</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 1950s, the GSUSA had begun significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations, accomplished by Murray Walls in 1956, was Camp Shantituck in <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Later the same year, <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> described Girl Scouts as &quot;a force for desegregation&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1969, a national Girl Scout initiative called Action 70 was created that aimed to eliminate <a href="prejudice" class="uri" title="wikilink">prejudice</a>.

<h3 id="wing-scouts">Wing Scouts</h3>

<p>The <strong>Wing Scout</strong> program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country, started in 1941 and ending in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from fifteen states met in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> to take Wing Scout leadership training. These leaders returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, Girl Scout Council in North <a href="San_Mateo_County" title="wikilink">San Mateo County</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> was presented with an offer from <a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a> San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an <a href="aviation" class="uri" title="wikilink">aviation</a> program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines' jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a <a href="airplane" title="wikilink">plane</a>. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after United Airlines experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="age-levels">Age levels</h2>

<p>The program was originally for girls aged from 10 to 17, but it was subsequently divided into three levels. <a href="Brownie_(Girl_Guides)" title="wikilink">Brownies</a> (for younger girls) was based on a program developed in England in 1914 and was officially recognized in the mid-1920s. At the same time, girls over 18, or over 16 if First Class Scouts, became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938, the age divisions were: Brownies (ages seven through nine), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 17).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <img src="BessTrumanGirlScoutsARC200404.gif" title="fig:Bess Truman with Girl Scouts and their leaders" alt="Bess Truman with Girl Scouts and their leaders" /> <img src="Hillary_Clinton_girl_scout.jpg" title="fig:Hillary Clinton posing with Girl Scouts" alt="Hillary Clinton posing with Girl Scouts" /> In 1963 the age structure was rearranged to Brownies (ages seven through nine, later six through nine), Juniors (ages nine through 11), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14), and Seniors (ages 14 through 17).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1984, the <a href="Girl_Scout_levels_(USA)#Daisy_Girl_Scouts" title="wikilink">Daisy</a> program for <a href="kindergarten" class="uri" title="wikilink">kindergarten</a> girls or those aged five was introduced.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 2003, the <a href="Studio_2B" title="wikilink">Studio 2B</a> program for girls aged from 11 up to 17 was introduced though Cadettes and Seniors.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Studio 2B allowed girls to call themselves by any name of their choosing, including but not limited to &quot;Studio 2Bs,&quot; <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> &quot;teen Girl Scouts,&quot; or Cadettes and Seniors. Girl Scouts, aged 11 through 17, can earn both traditional badges and undertake Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on topics such as <a href="environmentalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">environmentalism</a> or self-confidence rather than being ; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a basic planning procedure called <a href="SMART_(project_management)" title="wikilink">SMART</a> (standing for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely).</p>
<p>Level changes to be put into effect as of October 1, 2008 created a new class of Girl Scouts called Ambassadors for girls in <a href="Educational_stages" title="wikilink">Grades</a> 11 and 12 (around 16 to 18 years old), moving seniors to ninth and tenth grade (around 14 to 16 years old). The new levels were to be trialed in approximately 6 councils in Spring 2008, and begin national use after 1 October 2008.</p>
<p>Although troop membership is still the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not desire to participate in troop activities can sign up as an individual Girl Scout, known as a <a href="Juliette_(Girl_Scouts)" title="wikilink">Juliette</a>. Juliettes attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards.</p>
<p>The Campus Girl Scouts program allows women(ages 18 and older) to be active in Girl Scouting while in college. Campus Girl Scouting is an organization that helps promote and build student involvement in the community, the local council, and the college campus through service.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mariner-scouts">Mariner Scouts</h3>
<p>The 20th National Council of the GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Similar to the Boy Scouts' <a href="Sea_Scouts_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="wikilink">Sea Scouts</a>, the program was designed for older <a href="Girl_Guide_and_Girl_Scout" title="wikilink">Girl Scouts</a> interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, <em>Launching a Girl Scout Mariner Ship</em> and <em>Charting the Course of a Girl Scout Mariner Ship</em> were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined the Sea Scouts, which has been co-ed since 1971.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="special-programs">Special programs</h3>
<p>There are programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The <em>Girl Scouts Beyond Bars</em> program helps daughters of incarcerated mothers to connect with their mothers and to have the mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, <em>Girl Scouting in Detention Centers</em>, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in <a href="rural" class="uri" title="wikilink">rural</a> areas or in <a href="public_housing" title="wikilink">public housing</a>. There are also programs for American girls living overseas.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="organizational-structure">Organizational structure</h2>
<p>The national organization has its central headquarters in New York City. It has a staff of 400, and is headed by a <a href="Chief_Executive_Officer" title="wikilink">Chief Executive Officer</a> and a 40 member National Board of Directors. Kathy Cloninger has been the Chief Executive Officer since 2003 and is retiring in November 2011; the Chair of the National Board of Directors, the highest volunteer position, is Connie L. Lindsey.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Below the national organization were, as of 2006, 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which own the 236,000 local troops and other groups. As part of the August 26, 2006 reorganization, the National Board of Directors decided to restructure the 312 councils into 109 councils.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Some Councils own and run camps for the troops within its area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided again into areas, called Neighborhoods, Service Units, or Associations (terms vary), these are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.</p>
<p>The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as six to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.</p>
<p>In 2004, Girl Scouts of the USA hired Professor Willie Pietersen, an instructor at <a href="Columbia_Business_School" title="wikilink">Columbia Business School</a>, to use his expertise in business metrics &quot;to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth.&quot; They used his help in setting targets and implementing ways to change the organization for the better. In addition, six &quot;Gap Teams&quot; looked at ways for Girl Scouting to improve their structure to prepare for future growth and success for the organization.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as <a href="canoe" title="wikilink">canoeing</a> or <a href="Backpacking_(wilderness)" title="wikilink">backpacking</a> with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes and Christmas caroling or other community services.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Troops may also plan and take extended trips such as visiting another part of the United States or even travel to another country. Troops may organize <a href="culture" title="wikilink">cultural</a> or learning events such as first aid training or attending live theatre.</p>
<h3 id="destinations">Destinations</h3>

<p>Once known as &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; or <a href="Wider_Ops" title="wikilink">Wider Ops</a>, <a href="Destinations" class="uri" title="wikilink">Destinations</a> are travel opportunities in which individual older Girl Scouts from around the United States can participate. Destinations are held within the United States and in other countries, and may be activities such as forming part of the US delegation to another country's national <a href="Jamboree_(Scouting)" title="wikilink">jamboree</a>, or a visit to one of the international Girl Scouting centers. Destinations might be outdoor oriented, such as <a href="kayaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">kayaking</a> in Alaska, or career oriented such as learning about working for <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions. The most familiar is the annual sale of <a href="Girl_Scout_Cookies" title="wikilink">Girl Scout Cookies</a>, a fundraiser started in 1917 as a money earning opportunity for the local council and troops. Other customs are the Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence, two of the signs shared by WAGGGS member organizations.</p>
<p>&quot;Bridging&quot; is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. There is a notable bridging ceremony held in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, as Juniors bridge to Cadettes over the <a href="Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="wikilink">Golden Gate Bridge</a>.</p>
<p><a href="World_Thinking_Day" title="wikilink">World Thinking Day</a> and &quot;Girl Scouts' Own&quot; are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both <a href="Robert_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Robert Baden-Powell</a> and <a href="Olave_Baden-Powell" title="wikilink">Olave Baden-Powell</a>. On Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low's birthday on October 31, Founder's Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes, and serving birthday cake.</p>
<p>A &quot;Girl Scouts' Own&quot; is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. It is a solemn time given over to the girls themselves to create a moment of their very own. It is not technically a ceremony and can be held at any time and include the girls' troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Girl_Scout_working_on_her_Gold_Award_Project.jpg" title="fig:A Girl Scout working on her Gold Award project." alt="A Girl Scout working on her Gold Award project." /> Members can earn awards appropriate for their age level. Originally called badges, the terminology has changed to Learning Petals for Daisies, Try-Its for Brownies, Badges for Juniors, and Charms and Interest Project awards for Cadettes,Seniors,and Ambassadors (older girls).</p>
<p>The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the <a href="Gold_Award_(Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA)" title="wikilink">Girl Scout Gold Award</a>, which can only be earned by Seniors and Ambassadors.

These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The service projects must improve a current situation, such as restoring the eroded banks of a stream.</p>
<p>Girls can also earn and display on their uniform awards from outside organizations, such as the <a href="Religious_Emblems_Programs" title="wikilink">religious emblems</a> from religious organizations, or the <a href="President&#39;s_Volunteer_Service_Award" title="wikilink">President's Volunteer Service Award</a>. Scouts can also receive awards for lifesaving and leadership.
