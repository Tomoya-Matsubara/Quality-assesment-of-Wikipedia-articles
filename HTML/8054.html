<p><strong>Gilbert Foliot</strong> (<em><a href="circa" class="uri" title="wikilink">circa</a></em> 1110 &lt;U+2013&gt; 18 February 1187) was a medieval English <a href="monk" class="uri" title="wikilink">monk</a> and <a href="prelate" class="uri" title="wikilink">prelate</a>, successively <a href="Abbot_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Abbot of Gloucester</a>, <a href="Bishop_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Bishop of Hereford</a> and <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a>. Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk at <a href="Cluny_Abbey" title="wikilink">Cluny Abbey</a> in France at about the age of twenty. After holding two posts as <a href="prior" class="uri" title="wikilink">prior</a> in the Cluniac order he was appointed <a href="Abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abbot</a> of <a href="Gloucester_Abbey" title="wikilink">Gloucester Abbey</a> in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman <a href="Miles_de_Gloucester,_1st_Earl_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Miles of Gloucester</a>. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped to fabricate some <a href="charter" title="wikilink">charters</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;legal deeds attesting property ownership&lt;U+2014&gt;to gain advantage in a dispute with the <a href="archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishops of York</a>. Although Foliot recognised <a href="Stephen_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen</a> as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Empress Matilda</a>'s claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after the Stephen's release.</p>
<p>Foliot accompanied <a href="Theobald_of_Bec" title="wikilink">Theobald of Bec</a>, the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, to a papal council at <a href="Council_of_Reims" title="wikilink">Reims</a> in 1148. During his time there he was appointed to the <a href="Diocese_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Bishopric of Hereford</a> by <a href="Pope_Eugene_III" title="wikilink">Pope Eugene III</a>. Despite a promise made in Reims not to recognise Stephen, Foliot on his return to England nevertheless swore fealty to the king, causing a temporary rift in his relationship with <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry of Anjou</a>, Matilda's son, who eventually became King Henry II of England in 1154. When Theobald died in 1160, it was widely assumed that he would be replaced by Foliot, but King Henry nominated his <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Thomas_Becket" title="wikilink">Thomas Becket</a>, instead. Foliot later claimed to have opposed this appointment, and supported Henry during the king's dispute with the new archbishop. Foliot was <a href="Translation_(ecclesiastical)" title="wikilink">translated</a>, or moved, to the <a href="Diocese_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishopric of London</a> in 1163, perhaps as consolation for not receiving Canterbury.</p>
<p>During the great dispute between Becket and the king, Foliot was reviled by Becket and his supporters. He acted as an envoy for the king on a number of diplomatic missions related to this dispute and wrote a number of letters against Becket which were circulated widely in Europe. Becket excommunicated Foliot on two occasions, the second of which precipitated the archbishop's martyrdom. For a short period following Becket's death the papacy kept Foliot excommunicate, but he was quickly absolved and allowed to resume his <a href="Bishop" title="wikilink">episcopal functions</a>. In addition to his role in the Becket controversy, Foliot often served as a royal judge, and was an active administrator and bishop in his different dioceses. He was a prolific letter writer, and some of his correspondence was collected after his death. He also wrote sermons and biblical commentaries, two of which are extant.</p>

<p>Foliot attended the <a href="Second_Council_of_the_Lateran" title="wikilink">Second Lateran Council</a>, called by <a href="Pope_Innocent_II" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent II</a>. It opened on 4 April 1139, and among other matters heard an appeal from the Empress Matilda concerning her claim to the throne of England.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Matilda is usually referred to as &quot;Empress&quot; as she had been married to the German Emperor <a href="Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Henry V</a> until 1125, although she was never crowned as empress by a legitimate pope.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Even after her return to England, she continued to use the title &quot;Empress&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>|group=notes}} Matilda was the daughter and only surviving legitimate child of <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry I</a>, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, had seized the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In about 1143 Foliot wrote an account of the proceedings of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, <a href="Matilda_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Edith-Matilda</a>, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because <a href="Anselm_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Anselm of Canterbury</a> had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the <a href="House_of_Plantagenet" title="wikilink">Angevin</a> cause, as Matilda's claim was known.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>King Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces on 2 February 1141,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and Matilda called a council at <a href="Westminster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westminster</a> to gather support for her assuming the throne. Foliot attended the council and was one of her main supporters in the following months as the Angevin cause tried to place her on the throne.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>It was during his time as abbot that Foliot wrote his reply to <a href="Brien_FitzCount" title="wikilink">Brien FitzCount</a>, one of Matilda's earliest supporters, discussing the Second Council of the Lateran's deliberations on Matilda's cause. FitzCount, in a letter now lost, had presented his reasons for supporting Matilda, and Foliot's reply set forth a defence of Matilda's claim to the throne.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Foliot also wrote that Stephen had &quot;dishonoured the episcopate&quot; with his behaviour in 1139,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> when the king arrested <a href="Roger_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Roger of Salisbury</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and Roger's nephew, <a href="Alexander_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Alexander</a>, who was <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, as well as attempting to arrest another of Roger's nephews, <a href="Nigel_(Bishop_of_Ely)" title="wikilink">Nigel</a>, <a href="Bishop_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Bishop of Ely</a>. After the arrest Stephen forced the bishops to surrender their castles and secular government offices.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Most historians see Foliot's letter as firmly supporting Matilda's cause,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> although one of King Stephen's recent biographers, Donald Matthew, claims that Foliot's support was lukewarm at best, motivated by the location of his abbey in one of Matilda's strongholds. Matthew points out that Gloucester Abbey owed no military service in a <a href="Feudalism" title="wikilink">feudal levy</a>, which allowed Foliot to avoid choosing sides irrevocably. Matthew also points out that after 1141 Foliot is a signatory to just one of Matilda's charters.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Foliot did though address <a href="Robert,_1st_Earl_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Robert of Gloucester</a>'s defence of Matilda's rights, buttressing it with arguments of his own. Robert had argued that the Bible supported female succession, and quoted from Numbers, chapter 36, which allowed women to inherit, but prohibited them marrying outside their tribe. In his reply Foliot claimed that Robert had actually used Numbers, chapter 27, which had no restrictions on the marriage of heiresses.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>During his time as abbot Foliot became friendly with <a href="Ailred_of_Rievaulx" title="wikilink">Ailred of Rievaulx</a>, the medieval saint and writer,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> who dedicated a book of sermons to him.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Another friend and ally from his abbacy was <a href="Theobald_of_Bec" title="wikilink">Theobald of Bec</a>, the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, who during Stephen's reign was attempting to unite the English Church under his leadership. Foliot helped Theobald by forming a communication link to Matilda's side.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Foliot took an interest in the Dorset monastery of <a href="Cerne_Abbey" title="wikilink">Cerne Abbey</a>, which in 1145 received the Prior of Gloucester Abbey, Bernard, as abbot.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Bernard was an active reformer, and Foliot supported Bernard's efforts,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> but the monks objected to the new abbot, and drove him out of the monastery.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Both abbot and monks appealed to the papacy, which supported the abbot. Although Matilda wrote to Foliot, and interceded on behalf of the monks, Foliot pointed out that he was unable to disobey a papal command.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>While abbot, Foliot supervised the acquisition of a <a href="Priory" title="wikilink">dependent priory</a> in the city of <a href="Hereford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereford</a> for the monastery.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Most of the abbey buildings predate Foliot's time as abbot, and there is no sure evidence of any buildings he added to the monastery. During his abbacy, a dispute that had dragged on between Gloucester and the Archdiocese of York over some manors was finally settled in Gloucester's favour. This was done with a group of forged charters that Foliot may have helped to create. Forging charters was a common practice in English monasteries of the time.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Foliot also had disputes with the Welsh bishop <a href="Uhtred,_Bishop_of_Llandaff" title="wikilink">Uhtred, Bishop of Llandaff</a>, over <a href="Goldcliff_Priory" title="wikilink">Goldcliff Priory</a> and a church in <a href="Llancarfan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Llancarfan</a>,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> concerning tithes and new chapels that had been built without Gloucester Abbey's permission.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>After Henry of Anjou's accession to the throne of England as <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">King Henry II</a> in 1154, Foliot persuaded the Earl of Hereford to submit to the new king's demand that he return the custody of certain royal castles to the king.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to <a href="Pope_Alexander_III" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander III</a>, whom the king had just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, <a href="Antipope_Victor_IV_(1159&lt;U+2013&gt;1164)" title="wikilink">Victor IV</a>, intimating that the canonisation of King <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor <a href="Pope_Innocent_II" title="wikilink">Innocent II</a>, might be warranted as a reward for Henry's recognition of Alexander.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>The art historian Hans J. B&lt;U+00F6&gt;ker claims that Foliot began the construction of the Bishop's Chapel at <a href="Hereford_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Hereford Cathedral</a>. B&lt;U+00F6&gt;ker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> However most sources credit <a href="Robert_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Robert of Hereford</a>, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>When Theobald died in 1160, most observers believed that Foliot was the leading candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury.

Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the <a href="Order_of_Saint_Benedict" title="wikilink">Benedictine Order</a> and thus the <a href="cathedral_chapter" title="wikilink">cathedral chapter</a> at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but <a href="John_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">John of Salisbury</a> and <a href="Thomas_Becket" title="wikilink">Thomas Becket</a> apparently believed that Foliot desired it.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When <a href="Pope_Alexander_III" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander III</a> wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for his handling of the case.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>The king and Becket began quarrelling in July 1163, at first over financial matters and then over the marriage of Henry's younger brother to an heiress, which Becket forbade. The true spark to the quarrel was the matter of clergy who committed crimes, who the king wished to have prosecuted in secular courts; the archbishop refused, arguing that all clergy must be tried in church courts, even if the crime was non-ecclesiastical. At the Council of Westminster called by Henry in October 1163 to deal with the issue, Foliot at first sided with the other bishops, who supported Becket's position and opposed the king. However, after the council was dismissed, Foliot became the leader of those bishops who changed sides in support of the king. In December, Becket capitulated to the king.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 1164 the king summoned a council at <a href="Clarendon_Palace" title="wikilink">Clarendon</a>. The bishops were asked to approve the <a href="Constitutions_of_Clarendon" title="wikilink">Constitutions of Clarendon</a>, which proposed restrictions on the powers of the Church and limits to papal authority in England; Becket's refusal led to the great dispute between king and archbishop,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> into which Foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn. When Becket appeared before the court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him, a studied insult to the king,<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Foliot told the archbishop that &quot;If the king were to brandish his sword, as you now brandish yours, what hope can there be of peace between you?&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The king refused to see Becket, and negotiations between the two camps soon revealed that Becket had ordered the bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did. Becket also threatened to appeal the case to the papacy. Both of these actions by the archbishop breached the Constitutions of Clarendon. During the subsequent back and forth between the bishops and the king, as well as the bishops and the archbishop, Foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade Becket to modify his behaviour. Foliot replied that Becket &quot;was always a fool and always will be&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>After the bishops refused to pass judgment, the barons attempted to do so, but Becket refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to Becket and suggested a compromise, which Becket refused. Becket went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in <a href="Flanders" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flanders</a> on 2 November 1164.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Foliot was sent, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hilary of Chichester, <a href="Bartholomew_Iscanus" title="wikilink">Bartholomew Iscanus</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Exeter" title="wikilink">Bishop of Exeter</a>, <a href="Roger_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Roger of Worcester</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Worcester</a>, <a href="William_d&#39;Aubigny,_1st_Earl_of_Arundel" title="wikilink">William d'Aubigny, the Earl of Arundel</a>, and a group of royal clerks, to <a href="Thierry,_Count_of_Flanders" title="wikilink">Thierry</a> the <a href="Count_of_Flanders" title="wikilink">Count of Flanders</a>, <a href="Louis_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VII</a> the <a href="List_of_French_monarchs" title="wikilink">King of France</a>, and <a href="Pope_Alexander_III" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander III</a>.

Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the <a href="diocese_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">diocese of Canterbury</a>. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>In early summer 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, ordering him to intercede with the king and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but would still have to answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of <a href="simony" class="uri" title="wikilink">simony</a>, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although there is no evidence that Becket bought the office.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>On 10 June 1166, Becket excommunicated a number of his opponents, some specifically by name, as well as any who opposed his cause.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Henry's response was to order the English bishops to appeal to the pope, which they did at a council that Foliot organised and led in London on 24 June. The appeal was written by Foliot, and a separate letter from the bishops, also written by Foliot, was sent to the archbishop. The bishops rested their case on the fact that those excommunicated had not been warned or allowed to defend themselves. They pointed out to the pope that the king had not escalated the conflict and had behaved reasonably to the last papal overtures in the summer of 1165.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Becket replied to these moves with a letter written to Foliot that was full of resentment and reproaches.

<p>In November 1167 Foliot was summoned to <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some discussion and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket as well as the bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise on the subject of the Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18 November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>On 13 April 1169, Becket excommunicated Foliot, along with <a href="Hugh_Bigod,_1st_Earl_of_Norfolk" title="wikilink">Hugh, Earl of Norfolk</a>, Josceline of Salisbury, and seven royal officials. Becket did this even though none of them had been warned, and despite the fact that the pope had asked that Becket not make any such sentences until after a pending embassy to King Henry had ended. Becket also warned a number of others that unless they made amends to him, they too would be excommunicated on 29 May, <a href="Ascension_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Ascension Day</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> In his excommunication, Becket called Foliot &quot;that wolf in sheep's clothing&quot;.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Although Foliot tried to enlist the help of his fellow bishops in an appeal, they were less than helpful. Foliot then prepared to appeal his sentence to the pope in person, and travelled to Normandy in late June or early July, where he met the king, but proceeded no further towards Rome, as the papacy was attempting once more to secure a negotiated settlement.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> In late August and early September serious but ultimately fruitless negotiations took place between the king and the archbishop.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Foliot then proceeded to Rome, but at Milan he received word that his envoy at the papal court had secured the right for him to be absolved by the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Rouen" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Rouen</a>, <a href="Rotrou_(Archbishop_of_Rouen)" title="wikilink">Rotrou</a>. Foliot then returned to <a href="Rouen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rouen</a>, where he was absolved on 5 April and reinstated in his see on 1 May. The only requirement of this absolution was that Foliot accept a penance to be imposed by the pope.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Much of Foliot's objections to Becket's excommunication stemmed from the lack of warning that Foliot and the others had received, contrary to the customary and normal procedures. Becket and his supporters pointed out that there were some situations in which it was possible to excommunicate without warning,<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> but Foliot claimed that the present situation was not one of them. According to Foliot, Becket's habit was &quot;to condemn first, judge second&quot;.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Foliot's example of appealing excommunications to the papacy was an important step in the setting up of an appeal process for excommunication during the 12th century.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

Becket and the king came to terms on 22 July 1170, allowing the archbishop to return to England, which he did in early December. However, shortly before he landed in England, he excommunicated Roger of York, Josceline of Salisbury, and Foliot.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> One possible reason for the excommunications was that the three ecclesiastics had electors from the various vacant bishoprics with them, and were escorting those electors to the king on the continent in order to reward a number of royal clerks with the long vacant bishoprics. Included among those royal clerks were some of Becket's most bitter foes during his exile.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Although Becket offered to absolve Josceline and Foliot, he argued that only the pope could absolve Roger, as he was an archbishop. Roger persuaded the other two to appeal to the king, then in Normandy. When they did so, the royal anger at the timing of the excommunications was such that it led to Henry uttering the question often attributed to him &quot;Will no one rid me of the turbulent priest&quot;.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> This inspired four knights to set off from the king's court in Normandy to Canterbury, where on 29 December 1170, they murdered Becket.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p>Foliot and Becket seem to have been on amicable terms until 1163,<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> but their relationship seems to have soured after that date.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Becket accused Foliot in 1167 with: &quot;your aim has all along been to effect the downfall of the Church and ourself&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> After the pope absolved Foliot's excommunication in early 1170, Becket exclaimed to a cardinal that &quot;Satan is unloosed for the destruction of the Church&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> A modern biographer of Becket, the historian <a href="Frank_Barlow_(historian)" title="wikilink">Frank Barlow</a>, feels that one reason for Becket's change in behaviour after his election as archbishop was due to his need to &quot;out-bishop&quot; the other bishops, and prevent Foliot from making any more jibes about his inadequacies as an ecclesiastic.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Foliot was mainly a force for moderation in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of <em>ad cautelam</em>, which was an appeal to the papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of <em>ad cautelam</em> was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>During his time as bishop Foliot served for many years as a <a href="papal_judge-delegate" title="wikilink">papal judge-delegate</a>, especially in his later years. He was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters and other religious houses of the dioceses. He kept in constant contact with his <a href="archdeacon" title="wikilink">archdeacons</a> and <a href="Dean_(religion)" title="wikilink">deans</a> about the administration of the dioceses.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="writings">Writings</h2>
<p>Foliot was well known as a letter writer, and his letters were later collected as a book.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a>, is supposed to have originated in Foliot's own writing office.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> About 250 to 300 examples of Foliot's letters have survived,{{#tag:ref|Some of the documents are difficult to classify exactly as letters, as opposed to charters.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a>|group=notes}} which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500 items.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and <a href="Christopher_N._L._Brooke" title="wikilink">Christopher N.

The historian <a href="David_Knowles" title="wikilink">David Knowles</a> said of the collection that &quot;owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [it] is of the greatest value for the church historian&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> According to Knowles, Foliot's letters paint a picture of an active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the <a href="Gregorian_Reform" title="wikilink">Gregorian church reforms</a> but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> His letters are typical of the educated letter writer of his time, refined and polished to an art form.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>Foliot also wrote a number of sermons and commentaries on the Bible. Of the commentaries, only those on the <em>Song of Songs</em> and the <em>Lord's Prayer</em> still survive.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> The commentary on the <em>Song of Songs</em> was first printed in 1638, by <a href="Patrick_Young" title="wikilink">Patrick Young</a>. The commentary on the Lord's Prayer was first published by David Bell in 1989.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> About 60 of his <em>acta</em>, or decisions, as Bishop of Hereford still survive, and from his time at London a further 150 or so are extant.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> A contemporary, Peter, the prior of <a href="Holy_Trinity_Priory,_Aldgate" title="wikilink">Holy Trinity Priory</a> in <a href="Aldgate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldgate</a>, London, heard Foliot preach a sermon at a synod, and praised the sermon as &quot;adorned with flowers of words and sentences and supported by a copious array of authorities. It ran backwards and forwards on its path from its starting-point back to the same starting point.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> The sermon so inspired Peter that he wrote a work entitled <em>Pantheologus</em>, which dealt with the <em>distinctio</em> method of <a href="exegesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">exegesis</a>, which was developing around this time.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The date of the sermon cannot be fixed except that it took place between 1170 and Gilbert's death.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a>|group=notes}} All of Foliot's surviving theological works are based on exegesis.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>The antiquarian <a href="John_Bale" title="wikilink">John Bale</a> in the 1550s listed six works of Foliot known to him, five of which were letters. The sixth work known to Bale was the commentary on <a href="Song_of_Solomon" title="wikilink">the Song of Songs</a>, which survived in a single manuscript, now in the Bodleian Library. Young also recorded a <em>Lundinensis Ecclesiae</em> as being by Foliot. The scholar <a href="John_Pitts_(Catholic_scholar)" title="wikilink">John Pits</a> gave much the same list in 1619, adding one work, a <em>Vitas aliquot sanctorum Angliae, Librum unun</em>, but this work never appears in a medieval book catalogue and has not survived under this name so it is unclear if Foliot wrote such a work. The antiquary <a href="Thomas_Tanner_(bishop)" title="wikilink">Thomas Tanner</a>, writing in the early 18th century, listed Foliot as the author of the seven works given by Bale and Pits, adding an eighth, the <em>Tractatus Gilberti, episcopi London: Super Istud &quot;Sunt diuae olivae&quot;</em>, citing <a href="John_Leland_(antiquary)" title="wikilink">John Leland</a>, the <a href="16th_century" title="wikilink">16th-century</a> antiquary, as his source. This apparently is the collection of nine sermons on Saints Peter and Paul that has yet to be published and is still in manuscript at the Bodleian Library. Leland also listed another work by Foliot, the <em>Omeliae Gileberti, episcopi Herefordensis</em>, which he stated was held at <a href="Forde_Abbey" title="wikilink">Forde Abbey</a>. This work, since lost, might have been the sermons mentioned above, or could have been a known collection of homilies, also lost. It is also possible that another Gilbert was the author. Lastly, Walter Map recorded that Foliot had begun work on a &quot;the Old and the New Law&quot; shortly before his death.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and legacy</h2>
