<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>WNVZ originally signed on the air in <a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a> as a simulcast of Country music outlet 1270 WTID, (which is now separately owned Religious outlet WTJZ ) but by 1973 they would break off the simulcast and become WQRK, broadcasting a Top 40 format with custom made jingles, sped up records, and a lot of on air audio processing (Then known as &quot;QRK&quot; and &quot;Super Q&quot; at the time).In 1975 WQRK went from live to automated Top 40,in the late 70s and early 80s they evolved into a Live Adult Contemporary format.</p>
<p>But that would all change in August <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a> when they returned to a mainstream <a href="Top_40" title="wikilink">Top 40</a> format as Z104,and debuted the WNVZ calls and <strong>Z104</strong> name. (The station marked the retiring of the &quot;<strong>Q104 1/2</strong>&quot; moniker and hailed the return of the CHR format on the air with the slogan &quot;The Half Has Become a Whole.&quot;) About a year later they were using Mike Joseph's &quot;Hot Hits&quot; format, which had been done in several larger markets, but dropped Joseph by summer of 1985 By <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a> they would evolve into a <a href="Rhythmic_Top_40" title="wikilink">Rhythmic Top 40</a> direction. Today, it uses the slogan <strong>&quot;Today's Best Music&quot;</strong> to describe its broad-based mix of <a href="Hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">Hip-Hop</a>/<a href="R&amp;B" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a> and <a href="Rhythmic" title="wikilink">Rhythmic Pop</a> hits. This pits the station against its urban contemporary hip hop/R&amp;B competitor <a href="WOWI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WOWI</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p>The station flipped its format and positioning several weeks before acquiring its new call letters in late 1982, which meant that for a short period of time the station was using a new nickname (Z104) that was completely unrelated to its call letters (which were still WQRK). This resulted in a very curious-sounding top-of-the-hour station IDs that went something like: &quot;Z-104 is WQRK, Norfolk&quot;</p>
