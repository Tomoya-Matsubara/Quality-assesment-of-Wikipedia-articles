<p>A theme of Obama's keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and the title of his 2006 book, <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, was inspired by his pastor, Rev. <a href="Jeremiah_Wright" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Wright</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> In Chapter 6 of the book, titled &quot;Faith,&quot; Obama writes that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household.&quot; He describes his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.&quot; He describes his Kenyan father as &quot;raised a <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a>,&quot; but a &quot;confirmed atheist&quot; by the time his parents met, and his Indonesian step-father as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.&quot; The chapter details how Obama, in his twenties, while working with local churches as a <a href="community_organizing" title="wikilink">community organizer</a>, came to understand &quot;the power of the African American religious tradition to spur social change.&quot; Obama writes: &quot;It was because of these newfound understandings&lt;U+2014&gt;that religious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking, disengage from the battle for economic and social justice, or otherwise retreat from the world that I knew and loved&lt;U+2014&gt;that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of <a href="http://www.tucc.org/">Trinity United Church of Christ</a> one day and be baptized.&quot;<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>Obama has authored two bestselling books. The first, <em><a href="Dreams_from_My_Father" title="wikilink">Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance</a></em>, was published after his graduation from law school and before entering politics. In it he recalls his childhood in <a href="Honolulu,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> and <a href="Jakarta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jakarta</a>, college years in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, and his employment as a community organizer in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> in the <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a>. The book's last chapters describe his first visit to Kenya, a journey to connect with his <a href="Luo_(Kenya_and_Tanzania)" title="wikilink">Luo</a> family and heritage. In his preface to the 2004 revised edition, Obama explains that he had hoped the story of his family &quot;might speak in some way to the fissures of race that have characterized the American experience, as well as the fluid state of identity&lt;U+2014&gt;the leaps through time, the collision of cultures&lt;U+2014&gt;that mark our modern life.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> <em>Time</em> magazine's <a href="Joe_Klein" title="wikilink">Joe Klein</a> wrote that the book &quot;may be the best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician.&quot;<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The <a href="audio_book" title="wikilink">audio book</a> edition earned Obama the 2006 <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Spoken_Word_Album" title="wikilink">Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

Note: In January 2007, the <a href="online_magazine" title="wikilink">online magazine</a> <em><a href="Insight_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Insight</a></em> published an article claiming that &quot;political opponents within the Democratic Party&quot; had discovered Obama &quot;spent at least four years in a so-called Madrassa, or Muslim seminary&quot;. The article's anonymously authored and unsourced claims were subsequently repeated on television programs broadcast by the <em><a href="Fox_News_Channel" title="wikilink">Fox News Channel</a></em>. According to the <em>New York Times</em>: &quot;In an interview, John Moody, a senior vice president at Fox News, said its commentators had erred by citing the Clinton-Obama report. 'The hosts violated one of our general rules, which is know what you are talking about,' Moody said. 'They reported information from a publication whose accuracy we didn't know.'&quot;  See also:  Video: <a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

Note: Asked to comment on the political impact of his 1995 admission, Obama stated in an October 2006 interview: &quot;Oh, look, you know, when I was a kid, I inhaled. Frequently. That was the point. You know, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s not something I make light of. It's something that I wrote actually about in my first book, and it was reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teen-age boy. And in that sense, I think, the vast majority of Americans understand that teenage boys are frequently confused.&quot; For comparison with <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a>'s 1992 &quot;<a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1992#Character_issues" title="wikilink">didn't inhale</a>&quot; quote, see:  For full interview transcript, see: <a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
