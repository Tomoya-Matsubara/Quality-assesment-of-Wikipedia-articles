<p>&quot;<strong>You Win or You Die</strong>&quot; is the seventh episode of the <a href="HBO" class="uri" title="wikilink">HBO</a> <a href="medieval_fantasy" title="wikilink">medieval fantasy</a> television series <em><a href="Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Game of Thrones</a></em>, written by <a href="David_Benioff" title="wikilink">David Benioff</a> and <a href="D._B._Weiss" title="wikilink">D. B. Weiss</a> and directed by <a href="Daniel_Minahan" title="wikilink">Daniel Minahan</a>. Set to air May 29, 2011, the episode was released in advance immediately following the conclusion of &quot;<a href="A_Golden_Crown" title="wikilink">A Golden Crown</a>&quot; to HBO customers able to access the <a href="HBO_Go" title="wikilink">HBO Go</a> service.</p>
<p>The episode furthers the story line of deterioration of the political balance of the Seven Kingdoms, with Eddard Stark revealing what he has discovered to Cersei Lannister while King Robert is still away on a hunt. The title of the episode is part of a quote from Cersei Lannister during the final confrontation with Eddard: &quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.&quot; The catchphrase has been frequently used during the promotion of both the books and the TV series.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode attracted 2.4 million viewers in its initial airing, with a total of 3.2 million including the follow-up airing. The episode was generally well received by critics for its well-acted dramatic tension, but with several criticizing the coupling of exposition and nudity as &quot;sexposition&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Like previous episodes, &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; interweaves action happening in multiple separate locations within and around the Kingdom of <a href="Westeros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westeros</a>. While the dramatic center of this episode is in the capital of King's Landing, where the titular quote is issued, ongoing events at The Wall and Winterfell in the north and with the Dothraki across the narrow sea continue, and events at the Lannister army's camp are depicted as well.</p>
<h3 id="at-the-lannister-camp">At the Lannister Camp</h3>
<p>Lord Tywin Lannister (<a href="Charles_Dance" title="wikilink">Charles Dance</a>) has a talk with his son, Jaime Lannister (<a href="Nikolaj_Coster-Waldau" title="wikilink">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a>) while the former is skinning a stag (also the sigil of the current ruling family, House Baratheon). While Tywin chastises his children for causing the recent troubles with the Starks, he nevertheless believes this war is the perfect opportunity for the Lannisters to set up a dynasty as the new rulers of the Seven Kingdoms and gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, an area ruled by House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion Lannister.</p>
<h3 id="at-winterfell">At Winterfell</h3>
<p>The captured wildling Osha (<a href="Natalia_Tena" title="wikilink">Natalia Tena</a>), now a servant of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy (<a href="Alfie_Allen" title="wikilink">Alfie Allen</a>) who warns her that if she had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin (<a href="Donald_Sumpter" title="wikilink">Donald Sumpter</a>) tells Theon to leave her alone, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and opines that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.</p>
<h3 id="at-the-wall">At The Wall</h3>
<p>Benjen Stark's horse returns from north of the Wall without him much to the worry of his nephew, Jon Snow (<a href="Kit_Harington" title="wikilink">Kit Harington</a>). The new members of the Night's Watch are finally given their assignments on the Wall and take their oaths; however, much to Jon's disappointment and anger, he has been assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, like Benjen. Jon suspects Ser Alliser Thorne's involvement, as revenge for Jon defying him; however, his friend Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) assures Jon that being the Lord Commander's steward might mean being groomed to be the next Lord Commander. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a tree dedicated to the Old Gods north of the Wall, Jon's direwolf Ghost brings him a dismembered hand.</p>
<h3 id="across-the-narrow-sea">Across the Narrow Sea</h3>
<p>Daenerys Targaryen (<a href="Emilia_Clarke" title="wikilink">Emilia Clarke</a>) attempts to convince Khal Drogo (<a href="Jason_Momoa" title="wikilink">Jason Momoa</a>) to return to her homeland and reclaim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is not interested. While Daenerys and her entourage go sightseeing at a market, Ser Jorah Mormont (<a href="Iain_Glen" title="wikilink">Iain Glen</a>) receives a pardon for him to return to the Seven Kingdoms from an informant of Lord Varys (<a href="Conleth_Hill" title="wikilink">Conleth Hill</a>). Jorah realizes this means the order to assassinate Danaerys has been officially issued and quickly saves her from a wine merchant who tries to poison her. His plot discovered, the merchant tries to escape only to be caught by Daenerys' bodyguards. Drogo, angered by the attempt on his wife's life, vows to his followers that he will lead his horde to cross the Narrow Sea to invade the Seven Kingdoms as revenge and reclaim the Iron Throne for his unborn son.</p>
<h3 id="at-kings-landing">At King's Landing</h3>
<p>Ned (<a href="Sean_Bean" title="wikilink">Sean Bean</a>) confronts Queen Cersei (<a href="Lena_Headey" title="wikilink">Lena Headey</a>), stating that he knows that Prince Joffrey and his siblings are not King Robert's (<a href="Mark_Addy" title="wikilink">Mark Addy</a>) children, but rather incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime. Cersei defends her affair with Jaime, saying she tried to love Robert but he refused to love her as he was still in love with his late fiance, Ned's sister Lyanna Stark. Ned shows Cersei mercy and tells her to leave the capital with her children and get as far away as they can before he tells Robert the truth.</p>
<p>However, Lord Renly Baratheon (Gethin Anthony) returns and informs Ned that Robert has been mortally wounded by a boar on his hunt. On his deathbed, Robert dictates his will to Ned, in which Robert makes Ned the Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age. Ned writes down Robert's words, but instead of using &quot;Joffrey&quot;, Ned writes &quot;my rightful heir&quot;, making the succession ambiguous. Robert signs the will without reading this change in wording and begs Ned to make Joffrey a better man.</p>
<p>Fearing Cersei and the Lannisters will use this time to their advantage, Renly tries to convince Eddard they should raise an army and launch a <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a>. However, Ned refuses to dishonor Robert in his final hours and wants to assure the crown passes to the rightful heir: Stannis Baratheon, Robert's younger and Renly's older brother. Ignoring Renly's advice saying that they need a better leader to rule the Seven Kingdoms, Ned writes a letter to Stannis informing him of the situation, dispatching it to Dragonstone, Stannis's island fortress. Ned also reveals to Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish (<a href="Aidan_Gillen" title="wikilink">Aidan Gillen</a>) the truth of Joffrey's heritage, to which Littlefinger suggests they allow Joffrey and the Lannisters to take the throne, and if Joffrey proves to be an unfit ruler, they can use the truth to overthrow him and make Renly the King instead. Ned refuses such treason, asking Littlefinger to secure the support of the City Watch to overpower Cersei's men-at-arms if they attempt to seize the throne.</p>
<p>By the time Robert finally dies, Renly has fled the capital with his men and Joffrey has ordered his coronation within the fortnight. As Ned, his men, Littlefinger and the City Watch enter the throne room, Ned gives Ser Barristan Selmy (Ian McElhinney) of the Kingsguard Robert's will to read out aloud. However, Cersei refuses to follow Robert's will and tears it up, ordering Barristan to seize Ned. Ned orders his army to arrest Cersei and Joffrey, and not to harm Barristan. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark guardsmen while Littlefinger holds Ned at knife point, telling him he should have listened to his warning to not trust him.</p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>The episode was written by the showrunners <a href="David_Benioff" title="wikilink">David Benioff</a> and <a href="D._B._Weiss" title="wikilink">D. B. Weiss</a>, based on <a href="A_Game_of_Thrones" title="wikilink">the original book</a> by <a href="George_R._R._Martin" title="wikilink">George R. R. Martin</a>. The chapters included in &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; are 46, 48 to 50, and 55 (Eddard XII, Eddard XIII, Jon VI, Eddard XIV, and Daenerys VI), making it the episode that includes fewest chapters of the source novel in the entire first season.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Among the scenes created specifically for the show were a meeting between Tywin and Jaime Lannister (as Lord Tywin is field dressing a stag) and a &quot;training&quot; session between Littlefinger and two new female recruits for one of his brothels. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>&quot;You Win or You Die&quot; marks the first appearance of <a href="Charles_Dance" title="wikilink">Charles Dance</a> as Lord Tywin, the patriarch of the Lannister household. Cast in the role shortly after the production began, Dance had been the first choice of the producers and one of the fan favorites for the role. Author George R. R. Martin commented that &quot;his commanding screen presence and steely charisma should make him the perfect Lord Tywin.&quot; The deer that is field dressed by Tywin in the opening scene was an actual dead stag.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming-locations">Filming locations</h3>
<p>Most of the episode was shot on set at the Irish studios of <a href="The_Paint_Hall" title="wikilink">The Paint Hall</a>. The exteriors of the entrance of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei taking place in the Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in <a href="Rabat,_Malta" title="wikilink">Rabat</a>, in Malta.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>
<p>&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;'s first airing was seen by 2.4 million viewers, stabilizing the show's ratings. These could be considered positive when taking into account that the episode had been offered in advance during all the preceding week in HBO's online service, and that it had been aired in a three-day holiday weekend which often results in lower viewership. With the second airing, the total audience for the night was 3.2 million viewers.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>
<p>The episode was well received by critics. <a href="Time_Magazine" title="wikilink">Time</a>'s reviewer James Poniewozik called &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; the &quot;most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date&quot;,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="AOL_TV" title="wikilink">AOL TV</a>'s Maureen Ryan found it an excellent outing that &quot;saw the stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways&quot;,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="HitFix" class="uri" title="wikilink">HitFix</a>'s Alan Sepinwall called it a terrific episode and commended how &quot;it turned the spotlight on the characters who are villains in Ned Stark's version of the story&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Poniewozik continues: &quot;We knew this would be a significant episode if for no other reason than that it contains the scene--alluded to in the episode's title--that gives the series its name&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, a sentiment Sepinwall agrees with. Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, also considered &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; a climactic moment in the series.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>'s Matt Fowler noted that this was the episode that saw Ned Stark &quot;unfortunately thwarted by his own honorable intentions&quot; but that his &quot;stubborn nobility is what makes Ned such a great character.&quot; <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The final showdown with the Lannisters seizing control from Eddard's hands was much discussed, with many commentators criticizing Ned's ingenuity and his actions during the episode. In <a href="The_Atlantic" title="wikilink">The Atlantic</a>, Scott Meslow wrote that Eddard could never win the &quot;game of thrones&quot; because he is dedicated to play by the rules. In his opinion, &quot;one can't afford to play fair&quot; when the only outcomes are &quot;win&quot; or &quot;die&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> McNutt felt that the climax at the episode's end &quot;was really well handled by both the cast and the director (Dan Minahan)&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Besides the final confrontation between Eddard and Cersei, other scenes were praised by the critics. The introduction of <a href="Charles_Dance" title="wikilink">Charles Dance</a> as Lord Tywin Lannister was considered &quot;a beauty&quot; by Todd VanDerWerff from <a href="the_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">the A.V. Club</a>, admiring how a single scene depicted not only the relationship between Tywin and Jaime, but also all the dynamics of the Lannister clan. He also praises the work of <a href="Nikolaj_Coster-Waldau" title="wikilink">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a> in the scene, that despite having very few lines transmitted very well how much Jaime is cowed by his father. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Maureen Ryan agreed with that sentiment, and also lauded <a href="Natalia_Tena" title="wikilink">Natalia Tena</a>'s short appearance.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> David Sims (a second reviewer for the A.V. Club) highlighted the work of Mark Addy in his final scene, extending the praise to the rest of his work on the series.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics agreed that the scenes with the Dothraki were very strong, with the storyline having improved significantly since the first episodes. Poniewozik stated that &quot;this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but felt like the characters were as well-imagined as those in Westeros&quot;,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and McNutt felt the episode &quot;finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Drogo's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne lead to compliments to <a href="Jason_Momoa" title="wikilink">Jason Momoa</a>'s intensity and <a href="Emilia_Clarke" title="wikilink">Emilia Clarke</a>'s calm and loving facial expressions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the scene where Littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized as an example of the show's perceived abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device, a situation for which Myles McNutt coined the term &quot;sexposition&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Littlefinger's monologue was consistently praised and the comparison between Littlefinger's actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt, but many agreed with Meslow's statement that it had been &quot;annoyingly overshadowed by the series' most gratuitous sex scene to date&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Among the criticisms were its excessive length, the repetition of the dramatic approach, and the assumption that viewers were not going to pay attention when presented with a long exposition without including sex.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
