<p>According to a prevailing <a href="Models_of_migration_to_the_New_World" title="wikilink">New World migration model</a>, migrations of humans from <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a> to the Americas took place via <a href="Beringia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beringia</a>, a <a href="land_bridge" title="wikilink">land bridge</a> which connected the two continents across what is now the <a href="Bering_Strait" title="wikilink">Bering Strait</a>. The most recent <a href="Historical_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> could have taken place around 12,000 years ago, with the earliest period remaining a matter of some unresolved contention.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These early <a href="Paleo-Indians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleo-Indians</a> soon spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> According to the <a href="Oral_history" title="wikilink">oral histories</a> of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living there since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional creation accounts.</p>
<p>Application of <a href="Native_American_name_controversy#&quot;Indian&quot;_and_&quot;American_Indian&quot;" title="wikilink">the term &quot;Indian&quot;</a> originated with <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a>, who thought that he had arrived in the <a href="East_Indies" title="wikilink">East Indies</a> while seeking Asia.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Later, the Americas came to be known as the &quot;<a href="West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indies</a>&quot;, a name still used today to refer to the Caribbean. The use of the names &quot;Indies&quot; and &quot;Indian&quot; has served to imply some kind of racial or cultural unity for the aboriginal peoples of the Americas. Once created, the unified &quot;Indian&quot; was codified in law, religion, and politics. The unitary idea of &quot;Indians&quot; was not originally shared by indigenous peoples, but over the last two centuries many have embraced the identity. The term &quot;Indian&quot; does not include the <a href="Aleut_people" title="wikilink">Aleuts</a>, <a href="Inuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inuit</a>, or <a href="Yupik_peoples" title="wikilink">Yupik peoples</a>, but despite this they are still part of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.</p>

<p>The <a href="European_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">European colonization of the Americas</a> forever changed the lives and cultures of the peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. The continent was ravaged by epidemics of diseases such as <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>, <a href="measles" class="uri" title="wikilink">measles</a>, and <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a>, which were brought from Europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. The loss of lives was exacerbated by violence on the part of colonists who frequently perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h2>

<p><img src="Buffalo_Hunt.jpg" title="fig:A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin" alt="A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin" /> Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through <a href="artificial_selection" title="wikilink">artificial selection</a>, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of <a href="maize" class="uri" title="wikilink">maize</a> from wild <em><a href="teosinte" class="uri" title="wikilink">teosinte</a></em> grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> and <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> lexicons.</p>
<p>The South American highlands were a center of early agriculture.

Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic <a href="Native_American_use_of_fire" title="wikilink">Indians began using fire</a> in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p><img src="Quechuawomanandchild.jpg" title="fig:Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru" alt="Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru" /> Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a <a href="cultural_area" title="wikilink">cultural area</a> is <a href="Mesoamerica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesoamerica</a>, where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of <a href="nomad" title="wikilink">nomadic</a> hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.</p>

<p><img src="Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg" title="fig:Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico" alt="Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico" /> The development of <a href="writing" class="uri" title="wikilink">writing</a> is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the <a href="Mesoamerica" title="wikilink">Mesoamerican</a> region produced several <a href="Mesoamerican_writing_systems" title="wikilink">indigenous writing systems</a> beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the <a href="Cascajal_Block" title="wikilink">Cascajal Block</a>. The <a href="Olmec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Olmec</a> hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of <a href="San_Lorenzo_Tenochtitl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">San Lorenzo Tenochtitl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a> began to wane.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>The Maya <a href="writing_system" title="wikilink">writing system</a> (often called <em><a href="Maya_script" title="wikilink">hieroglyphs</a></em> from a superficial resemblance to the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egyptian</a> writing) was a combination of <a href="phonetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">phonetic</a> symbols and <a href="logogram" title="wikilink">logograms</a>. It is most often classified as a <strong><a href="logogram" title="wikilink">logographic</a></strong> or (more properly) a <strong><a href="logosyllabic" class="uri" title="wikilink">logosyllabic</a></strong> writing system, in which <a href="syllabary" title="wikilink">syllabic</a> signs play a significant role. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the <a href="spoken_language" title="wikilink">spoken language</a> of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different <a href="glyph" title="wikilink">glyphs</a> although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.</p>

<p>The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often <a href="pentatonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">pentatonic</a>. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and <a href="wind_instrument" title="wikilink">wind instruments</a> such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and &quot;rain&quot; tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600&lt;U+2013&gt;900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is astonishing in at least two respects. First, it is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European <a href="musical_instrument" title="wikilink">musical instruments</a>.

Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.</p>
<p>Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans, they are <a href="Kichwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kichwa</a> speakers and include the Caranqui, the <a href="Otavalo_people" title="wikilink">Otavalos</a>, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the <a href="Panzaleo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panzaleo</a>, the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruh&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the <a href="Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ari</a>, and the Saraguro.

The Pipil lived in western <a href="El_Salvador" title="wikilink">El Salvador</a>, spoke <a href="Nahuat" title="wikilink">Nawat</a>, and had many settlements there, most noticeably the <a href="Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;or&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_of_Cuzcatl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;or&lt;U+00ED&gt;o of Cuzcatl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and <a href="fertile_soil" title="wikilink">fertile land</a> that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in <a href="El_Salvador" title="wikilink">El Salvador</a> as they had in other lands like <a href="Guatemala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatemala</a> or <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by <a href="Pedro_de_Alvarado" title="wikilink">Pedro de Alvarado</a> along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like <a href="Izalco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Izalco</a>, <a href="Panchimalco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panchimalco</a>, <a href="Sacacoyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sacacoyo</a>, and <a href="Nahuizalco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nahuizalco</a>.</p>

They speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects, but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades.

<h2 id="native-american-name-controversy">Native American name controversy</h2>

<p>The <strong>Native American name controversy</strong> is an ongoing dispute over the acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Once-common terms like &quot;Indian&quot; remain in use, despite the introduction of <a href="Geopolitics" title="wikilink">geopolitically</a> correct terms such as &quot;Indian American&quot;, &quot;Native American&quot; and &quot;Amerindian&quot; during the latter half of the 20th century.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rise-of-indigenous-movements">Rise of indigenous movements</h2>

<p>In recent years, there has been a rise of indigenous movements in the Americas (mainly South America). These are rights-driven groups that organize themselves in order to achieve some sort of <a href="self-determination" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-determination</a> and the preservation of their culture for their peoples. Organizations like the <a href="Coordinator_of_Indigenous_Organizations_of_the_Amazon_River_Basin" title="wikilink">Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin</a> and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are breaking the barrier of borders in order to obtain rights for <a href="Amazon_Basin" title="wikilink">Amazonian</a> indigenous populations everywhere. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the <a href="International_Indian_Treaty_Council" title="wikilink">International Indian Treaty Council</a> and the accession of native Indian group into the <a href="Unrepresented_Nations_and_Peoples_Organization" title="wikilink">Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization</a>.</p>
<p>There has also been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale, with the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> adopting the <a href="Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples" title="wikilink">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, despite dissent from the stronger countries of the Americas.</p>
<p>In Colombia, various indigenous groups protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in <a href="Cali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cali</a> in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the <a href="free_trade" title="wikilink">free trade</a> pact with the United States.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<p>Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European &quot;foreign <a href="power_elite" title="wikilink">power elite</a>&quot; to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with the Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. Furthermore, in a cathartic blow to the US-backed elite, it questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and <a href="Nicaragua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a>.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>The forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called &quot;Crescent departments&quot; in Bolivia to impose their autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency. Amongst others, representatives of <a href="CONAIE" class="uri" title="wikilink">CONAIE</a>, the <a href="National_Indigenous_Organization_of_Colombia" title="wikilink">National Indigenous Organization of Colombia</a>, the Chilean Council of All Lands, and the Brazilian Landless Movement participated in the forum.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
