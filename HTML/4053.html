<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>To date two ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy have been named &quot;Monowai&quot;</p>
<p><strong>1939-1946</strong> It was taken over by the Royal Navy in 1939 and converted to an <a href="armed_merchant_cruiser" title="wikilink">armed merchant cruiser</a> and later again to a <a href="troop_ship" title="wikilink">troop ship</a>. As an armed merchant cruiser, was attacked by the Japanese submarine I20 in <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>. As a troop ship, was the only New Zealand ship to take part in the Normandy Landings in <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>. The ship was returned to its owners in <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1977-1998</strong> In 1977 the RNZN took over the former Pacific Island ferry &quot;Moana Roa&quot; as a replacement for WWII era HMNZS Lachlan. The ship was converted in the United Kingdom and returned to NZ for service as the &quot;ghost of the coast&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1985 Monawai deployed to <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a> with a platoon of naval gunners who were to act as a landing party in the event that the coup became bloody.</p>
<p>In 1994 Monawai again entered the news, when the ship rescued a number of people from a yachts in distress during a storm.</p>
<p>The ship was decommissioned in 1998 and sailed for the UK later that year for refitting as a liner. The project never proceeded and it is likely the ship will be scrapped. </p>
