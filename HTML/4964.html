The airline holds several world records, one of them for the highest number of passengers on a commercial aircraft, a record set by <a href="Operation_Solomon" title="wikilink">Operation Solomon</a>, when Jewish refugees were brought over from Ethiopia.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>In September 1948, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>'s first <a href="President_of_Israel" title="wikilink">president</a>, <a href="Chaim_Weizmann" title="wikilink">Chaim Weizmann</a>, attended a conference in <a href="Geneva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geneva</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>. Weizmann was scheduled to fly back to Israel in a government aircraft, but due to the embargo imposed on Israel at the time, this was not possible. A <a href="C-54" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-54</a> military transport aircraft was converted into a civilian plane for this purpose. The aircraft was painted with the <strong>El Al/Israel National Aviation Company</strong> logo and fitted with extra fuel tanks to enable a non-stop flight from Geneva to Israel. It departed from <a href="Tel_Nof_Israeli_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Ekron Air Base</a> on <a href="September_28" title="wikilink">September 28</a>, and returned to Israel on <a href="September_30" title="wikilink">September 30</a>. After the flight, the aircraft was repainted and returned to military use.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The airline was incorporated and became Israel's official carrier on <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>, <a href="1948" class="uri" title="wikilink">1948</a>, although it used borrowed aircraft until February 1959, when two unpressurised <a href="DC-4" class="uri" title="wikilink">DC-4</a>'s were purchased from <a href="American_Airlines" title="wikilink">American Airlines</a>. The acquisition was funded by the <a href="Politics_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Israeli government</a>, the <a href="Jewish_Agency_for_Israel" title="wikilink">Jewish Agency</a>, and other Jewish organizations. The first plane arrived at <a href="Ben_Gurion_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Lod Airport</a> on <a href="April_3" title="wikilink">April 3</a>, <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a>. Aryeh Pincus, a lawyer from <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, was elected head of the company. The first international flight, from <a href="Tel_Aviv" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv</a> to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> (refueling in Rome), took place on <a href="July_31" title="wikilink">July 31</a>, <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By the end of 1949, the airline had flown passengers to London and Johannesburg. A regular service to London was inaugurated in the middle of 1950. Later that year, El Al acquired Universal Airways, which was owned by South African Zionists. A state-run domestic airline, <a href="Arkia_Israel_Airlines" title="wikilink">Israel Inland Airlines</a>, was founded in which El Al had a 50% stake.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>El Al's cargo service was inaugurated in 1950, and initially relied on military surplus <a href="C-46" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-46</a> aircraft. That same year, the airline initiated charter services to the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a>, followed by scheduled flights soon afterwards.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> From its earliest days, operation of the airline in keeping with Jewish tradition has been a source of friction. When the Israeli prime minister <a href="David_Ben_Gurion" title="wikilink">David Ben Gurion</a> was forming his first coalition, the religious parties would not join unless Ben Gurion promised that El Al would serve only <a href="kosher" class="uri" title="wikilink">kosher</a> food on its flights and would not fly on the <a href="Shabbat" title="wikilink">Jewish Sabbath</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <img src="El_Al_ocean_ad.png" title="fig:El Al&#39;s 1958 ad promoting non-stop transatlantic services" alt="El Al&#39;s 1958 ad promoting non-stop transatlantic services" width="200" /></p>
<p>As the national carrier, the airline was involved in several covert operations. In the early 1950s, El Al airlifted over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_India" title="wikilink">India</a>, <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Iran" title="wikilink">Iran</a>, <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_Iraq" title="wikilink">Iraq</a> and <a href="Yemenite_Jews" title="wikilink">Yemen</a> as part of <a href="Operation_Magic_Carpet_(Yemen)" title="wikilink">Operation Magic Carpet</a> and <a href="Operation_Ezra_and_Nehemiah" title="wikilink">Operation Ezra and Nehemiah</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1960, <a href="Nazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> war criminal <a href="Adolf_Eichmann" title="wikilink">Adolf Eichmann</a> was captured and flown from Argentina to Israel on an El Al aircraft.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1955, after using unreliable and noisy <a href="Lockheed_Constellation" title="wikilink">Lockheed Constellations</a> for several years, the airline purchased two <a href="Bristol_Britannia" title="wikilink">Bristol Britannia</a> aircraft. El Al was the second airline in the world to fly this plane, after the <a href="British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation" title="wikilink">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>In 1958, El Al ran a newspaper advertisement in the <a href="USA" title="wikilink">US</a> featuring a picture of a &quot;shrunken&quot; Atlantic Ocean (&quot;Starting Dec. 23, the Atlantic Ocean will be 20% smaller&quot;) to promote its non-stop <a href="transatlantic" class="uri" title="wikilink">transatlantic</a> flights.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This was a bold step: The airline industry had never used images of the ocean in its advertising because of the widespread public fear of airline crashes. The advertisement, which ran only once, proved effective. Within a year, El Al's sales tripled.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="expansion-in-the-1960s">Expansion in the 1960s</h3>
<p>Despite the purchase of Britannias and inauguration of non-stop transatlantic flights, the airline remained unprofitable.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> When Efraim Ben-Arzi took over the company in the late 1950s, the Britannias were replaced by <a href="de_Havilland_Comet" title="wikilink">de Havilland Comet 4</a>, <a href="Boeing_707" title="wikilink">Boeing 707</a>, and <a href="Douglas_DC-8" title="wikilink">Douglas DC-8</a> jets. The first year that El Al turned a profit was 1960. That year, more than 50 percent of the passengers flying into Israel arrived on El Al flights.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On <a href="15_June" title="wikilink">15 June</a> <a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a>, the airline set a world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight: An El Al <a href="Boeing_707" title="wikilink">Boeing 707</a> flew from Tel Aviv to <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, covering 5,760 miles in 9 hours and 33 minutes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By this time, El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a year - on a par with <a href="Qantas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qantas</a> and ahead of established airlines like <a href="Loftleidir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loftleidir</a>. In 1961, El Al ranked 35th in the world in the number of accumulated passenger-miles.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> El Al's success continued into the late 1960s. In 1968, regular flights to <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a> were inaugurated, and cargo flights began to Europe and the USA. The airline also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism and Aviation Services Ltd. All these ventures brought in an annual profit of $2 million that year.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="el-al-as-a-target-of-hijacking-and-terrorism">El Al as a target of hijacking and terrorism</h3>
<p>In 1968, El Al experienced what would become the first of many acts of terrorism against the airline. On <a href="July_23" title="wikilink">July 23</a>, the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the <a href="Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a> (PFLP). The aircraft was en route from <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, to <a href="Lod" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lod</a>, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>. The hijackers diverted it to <a href="Algiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algiers</a>. Bargaining with the hijackers went on for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed. The hijackers had departed from Beirut armed, with the full consent of the Lebanese authorities.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On <a href="December_26" title="wikilink">December 26</a>, two PFLP terrorists attacked an El Al aircraft at Athens Airport, killing an Israeli mechanic.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Again, Lebanon was held accountable for the attack. The <a href="IDF" class="uri" title="wikilink">IDF</a> retaliated on <a href="December_29" title="wikilink">December 29</a> with a nighttime raid on Lebanon's <a href="Beirut_Airport" title="wikilink">Beirut Airport</a> airport, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to <a href="Middle_East_Airlines" title="wikilink">Middle East Airlines</a>, <a href="Trans_Mediterranean_Airways" title="wikilink">Trans Mediterranean Airways</a> and Lebanese International Airways.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On <a href="February_18" title="wikilink">February 18</a> <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>, Palestinians attacked an El Al plane at <a href="Zurich_Airport" title="wikilink">Zurich Airport</a> killing the copilot and injuring the pilot. One Palestinian attacker was killed and others were convicted but later released.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Between September and December 1969, bomb and grenade attacks occurred at El Al offices in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, and <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This wave of violence culminated in the failed hijacking of an El Al <a href="Boeing_707" title="wikilink">Boeing 707</a> by <a href="Patrick_Arguello" title="wikilink">Patrick Arguello</a> and <a href="Leila_Khaled" title="wikilink">Leila Khaled</a> on <a href="September_6" title="wikilink">September 6</a> <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>, as part of the <a href="Dawson&#39;s_Field_hijackings" title="wikilink">Dawson's Field hijackings</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>El Al acquired its first <a href="Boeing_747" title="wikilink">Boeing 747</a> in 1971. Many felt it was a risky purchase, given the high cost of the plane and fear of attacks, but El Al operations flourished, and the airline was highly regarded around the world despite a fleet of only twelve aircraft. Another 747 was delivered in 1973. This was the plane used to inaugurate nonstop service from Tel Aviv to New York. In the air for thirteen hours, and flying against prevailing winds, it was recorded as the longest commercial airplane flight in the world.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, El Al began to schedule flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on <a href="Shabbat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shabbat</a> and landed in Israel when Shabbat was over. The religious parties in the government claimed that this was a violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed in the early days of the state, when El Al promised to refrain from flying on Shabbat. This dispute culminated in the fall of the Labor government. Elections were held, and the new prime minister, <a href="Menachem_Begin" title="wikilink">Menachem Begin</a>, promised to abide by the agreement. Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982, El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1977, El Al established a charter subsidiary then known as El Al Charter Services Ltd., but later renamed <a href="Sun_D&#39;Or" title="wikilink">Sun D'Or International Airlines Ltd</a>. Two years earlier, the airline had suffered its first losses since the late 1950s, largely a product of the global recession. The management was changed three times towards the end of the 1970s, until Itzhak Shander was named president. As the political situation in Iran deteriorated, El Al began to airlift Jews to Israel. All the airline's infrastructure in Iran was eventually torched and destroyed.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> El Al flights to <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a> were inaugurated in April 1980, following the <a href="Israel-Egypt_Peace_Treaty" title="wikilink">peace agreement</a> with Egypt.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In late 1982, after a long period of labor disputes and strikes, El Al operations were suspended. The government appointed Amram Blum to run the company, which lost $123.3 million in the fiscal year ending April 1983.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The airline also sold its stake in <a href="Arkia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arkia</a> at this time.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Operations resumed in January 1983 under receivership. The government purchased two new <a href="Boeing_737" title="wikilink">Boeing 737</a> aircraft and announced plans to acquire four <a href="Boeing_767" title="wikilink">Boeing 767</a> jets at the cost of $200 million. Within four years, El-Al was profitable again.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> It broke another record in May 1988 with a non-stop flight from <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> to Tel Aviv, a journey of 7,000 miles in 13 hours and 41 minutes.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Flights to Poland and Yugoslavia were inaugurated in 1989.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>In January 1990, <a href="North_American_Airlines" title="wikilink">North American Airlines</a> began flying to Israel, in part to provide feeder services to El Al gateways in North America. El Al held a 24.9% stake in the airline until selling it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al was operating a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the <a href="Boeing_757" title="wikilink">Boeing 757</a>. Early that year, El Al inaugurated regular flights to <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> following the collapse of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. No airlifts were possible at this time, but permission was granted in 1991. Charter flights commenced in August 1991, with immigrants also occupying all available seats on El Al's scheduled routes. In cooperation with <a href="Aeroflot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeroflot</a>, El Al flew more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three year period.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

After the first phase of the long-delayed privatization of the company commenced in June 2003, and 15% of El Al's shares were listed on the <a href="Tel_Aviv_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv Stock Exchange</a>, the policy regarding Sabbath flights was expected to change.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="religious-controversy">Religious controversy</h2>
<p>El Al caters to the needs of religious Jewish passengers flying to and from Israel by serving only kosher food (under rabbinical supervision; glatt kosher food is also available on request). On long-haul flights, passenger-led prayer services are held at the back of the plane. El Al does not fly on <a href="Shabbat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shabbat</a>, despite the financial losses that this entails. An estimated 20-30% of the passengers are ultra-Orthodox.

Operating on Shabbat could result in a <a href="Haredi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haredi</a> boycott that would pose a major financial blow and cripple the airline. <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> After an airport strike in November 2006, El Al allowed some planes to take off on Shabbat to reduce the backlog.

<h2 id="el-al-security">El Al security</h2>
<p>As a target of terrorism for many decades, El Al employs stringent security procedures, both on the ground and aboard its aircraft. These effective, though sometimes controversial, procedures have won El Al the reputation of being the most secure airline in the world.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="airport-security-measures">Airport security measures</h3>
<p>Passengers are asked to report three hours before departure. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored for security. There are plainclothes agents and fully armed police or military personnel who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers will be asked questions about where they are coming from, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. The likelihood of potential terrorists remaining calm under such questioning is believed to be low (see also <em><a href="Microexpression" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microexpression</a></em>).<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> At the <a href="check-in" class="uri" title="wikilink">check-in</a> counter, the passenger's <a href="passport" class="uri" title="wikilink">passport</a> and <a href="Airline_ticket" title="wikilink">ticket</a> are closely examined. A ticket without a sticker from the <a href="security" class="uri" title="wikilink">security</a> checkers will not be accepted. At passport control, the person's name is passed through computer checks utilizing information from the U.S. <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), <a href="Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service" title="wikilink">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS), <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a>, <a href="Shin_Bet" title="wikilink">Shin Bet</a> and <a href="Interpol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Interpol</a> databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, even if they are supervised by government or private security firms.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flight-security-measures">Flight security measures</h3>
<p><a href="Undercover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Undercover</a> agents (sometimes referred to as <a href="sky_marshal" title="wikilink">sky marshals</a>) carrying concealed firearms sit amongst the passengers on every international El Al flight.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Most El Al pilots are former <a href="Israeli_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Israeli Air Force</a> fighter pilots, and all El Al flight crew members are trained in hand-to-hand combat. Most El Al employees, male and female, have served in the <a href="Israel_Defense_Force" title="wikilink">Israel Defense Force</a>, as Israeli citizens are drafted at the age of 18. <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <img src="Elal.b777-200.4x-ecd.arp.jpg" title="fig:El Al Boeing 777" alt="El Al Boeing 777" /></p>
<p>The cockpits in all El Al aircraft have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. A <a href="password" title="wikilink">code</a> is required to access the doors, and the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the <a href="Captain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Captain</a> or <a href="First_Officer" title="wikilink">First Officer</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Furthermore, there are reinforced <a href="steel" class="uri" title="wikilink">steel</a> floors separating the <a href="passenger" class="uri" title="wikilink">passenger</a> <a href="cabin" class="uri" title="wikilink">cabin</a> from the <a href="baggage" class="uri" title="wikilink">baggage</a> hold.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion. The El Al fleet is also the only commercial airline fleet in the world to be equipped with anti-missile <a href="countermeasures" class="uri" title="wikilink">countermeasures</a>, utilizing the radar-based Flight Guard system.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and other European countries have expressed concern that <a href="flares" class="uri" title="wikilink">flares</a> dropped by this automated system could cause fires in the vicinity of the airport.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> El Al does not divulge information about these systems.</p>
<h3 id="security-controversy-and-passenger-profiling">Security controversy and passenger profiling</h3>
<p>According to a report published by the Center Against Racism and the Arab Association for Human Rights in December 2006, during El Al security checks passengers are racially profiled.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The report goes further to claim that this is unfair, irrational, and degrading to those undergoing the stringent screening procedures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are those, such as the political analyst <a href="Daniel_Pipes" title="wikilink">Daniel Pipes</a>, who do not consider the policy of passenger profiling to be racist. According to Pipes, &quot;however distasteful, there must be special scrutiny of Muslims in the West for security purposes.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The airline was also criticised by the Hungarian courts for refusing to search luggage with the passenger present, acting against Hungarian domestic laws which stipulate that only authorized officials are able to undertake such searches.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Stringent security measures have ensured that no El Al aircraft has been successfully hijacked since 1968. Most recently, on <a href="November_17" title="wikilink">November 17</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, Tawfiq Fukra, a twenty-three-year-old <a href="Israeli_Arab" title="wikilink">Israeli Arab</a>, attempted to hijack an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Turkey. He was reportedly armed with a pocket knife and attempted to break into the cockpit in order to fly the aircraft back to Israel and crash it into a building, but was apprehended by on-board security personnel.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Fukra has denied the charges.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> El Al's security protocol has proven highly effective and is now a model for airlines around the world.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="el-al-fleet">El Al fleet</h2>
<p>El Al has an all-<a href="Boeing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boeing</a> fleet which consists of the following aircraft. The airline names some of its aircraft after cities, towns, and regions in Israel.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> All El Al aircraft offer passengers economy class (Y class) and business class (J class) while El Al's Boeing 747 and 777 aircraft also have first class cabins (F class).</p>
