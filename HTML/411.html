<p><strong>&quot;Bring The Light&quot;</strong> is a song from <a href="The_Smashing_Pumpkins" title="wikilink">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>' 2007 album, <em><a href="Zeitgeist_(album)" title="wikilink">Zeitgeist</a></em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring the Light&quot; features the well-known rock sound of the Pumpkins, with a somewhat over-the-top sensibility (namely, heavy vocal overdubs and a double, harmonized <a href="guitar_solo" title="wikilink">guitar solo</a>). It also features heavy use of <a href="palm_muting" title="wikilink">palm muting</a>. The song's sensibility is largely thanks to producer <a href="Roy_Thomas_Baker" title="wikilink">Roy Thomas Baker</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The song was conspicuously absent from the Pumpkins' summer 2007 tour, but was debuted in the <a href="North_American" title="wikilink">North American</a> leg on September 13, 2007 at the Pearl Theater in <a href="Las_Vegas" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>. The song's doubled, harmonized guitar solo was replicated by both Corgan and second guitarist <a href="Jeff_Schroeder" title="wikilink">Jeff Schroeder</a>, producing a dual lead sound rare for the band. The song has since been added to the regular setlist and has been well-received.</p>
<p>Though it has not been released as a single, it has fared better than the official second single from the album, &quot;<a href="That&#39;s_the_Way_(My_Love_Is)" title="wikilink">That's the Way (My Love Is)</a>&quot;, in certain quarters, peaking at number 5 in <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a>. It has also enjoyed airplay in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> and <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>, and on <a href="WXRK" title="wikilink">K-ROCK</a>, <a href="KROQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">KROQ</a>, and <a href="Ethel_(XM)" title="wikilink">Ethel</a>, peaking at #277 on the U.S Modern Rock charts in early November. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
