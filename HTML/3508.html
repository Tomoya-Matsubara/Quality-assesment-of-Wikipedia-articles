He is wearing livery presented by the Empress of Austria the previous winter." width="200" /> The <strong>Mozart family's grand tour</strong> (1763–66) was an extended journey around the capitals and other major cities of western Europe, undertaken by <a href="Leopold_Mozart" title="wikilink">Leopold Mozart</a>, his wife <a href="Anna_Maria_Mozart" title="wikilink">Anna Maria</a>, and their musically gifted children <a href="Maria_Anna_Mozart" title="wikilink">Maria Anna</a> (Nannerl) and <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Amadeus</a>. Leopold was a court musician to the <a href="Archbishopric_of_Salzburg" title="wikilink">Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg</a>, and by 1763 held the post of deputy <a href="Kapellmeister" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kapellmeister</a>. He obtained a protracted leave of absence so that the precocious talents of his children, then aged eleven and seven respectively, could be demonstrated to the wider world.</p>
<p>The children's extraordinary skills had already been revealed during visits to <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> and <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> in 1762. In Vienna they had played before the <a href="Empress_Maria_Theresa" title="wikilink">Empress Maria Theresa</a>, and a schedule of public performances had earned considerable sums of money. The social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip, taking in the major European courts, complemented what Leopold saw as his duty, as a Catholic and a German, to display the talents of his miraculous children.</p>
<p>The grand tour itinerary took the family, via Munich and <a href="Frankfurt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankfurt</a>, to <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>. From there they travelled to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, and, after a stay of five months, departed for <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> for what would be their longest sojourn of fifteen months. In London Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first <a href="symphonies" class="uri" title="wikilink">symphonies</a>. The family moved on to <a href="Holland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holland</a>, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, but Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward journey incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>, before the family's return to <a href="Salzburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salzburg</a> in November 1766.</p>
<p>The children's performances inspired comments of rapture and amazement wherever they played. However, the material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. The journey enabled the children to experience fully the cosmopolitan musical world, and to receive an outstanding education, which in Wolfgang's case continued through further journeys during the next six years.</p>

<p>Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Their musical education began from the cradle, through the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the <a href="harpsichord" class="uri" title="wikilink">harpsichord</a>, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account &quot;the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him [...] When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable <a href="piano_concerto" title="wikilink">piano concerto</a>, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <img src="Marie_Antoinette_Young1.jpg" title="fig:Marie Antoinette, aged 7, in 1763, when she met Mozart in Vienna" alt="Marie Antoinette, aged 7, in 1763, when she met Mozart in Vienna" /> Nannerl herself was an extremely apt pupil, no less quick to learn than her brother, playing the keyboard with striking virtuosity by the time she was eleven.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In that year, 1762, Leopold brought the children to Munich to play before <a href="Maximilian_III_Joseph" title="wikilink">Maximilian III Joseph</a>, the <a href="prince-elector" title="wikilink">Elector</a> of <a href="Bavaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bavaria</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Leopold then took the entire family to Vienna, on a trip that lasted for three months.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He had secured invitations from several noble patrons, and within three days of arriving the children were playing at the palace of Count Collalto. Among those present was the Viennese Treasury councillor and future prime minister Johann Karl Count Zinzendorf, who noted in his diary that &quot;a little boy, said to be only five-and-a-half years old [Wolfgang was actually nearly seven] played the harpsichord&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After an appearance before the Imperial Vice-Chancellor, the Mozarts were invited to the royal court, where the <a href="Empress_Maria_Theresa" title="wikilink">Empress Maria Theresa</a> tested Wolfgang's abilities by requiring him to play with the keyboard covered.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> During this court visit Wolfgang met the Archduchess Maria Antonia, the future Queen <a href="Marie_Antoinette" title="wikilink">Marie Antoinette</a> of France, who was two months his senior. Mozart biographer <a href="Eric_Blom" title="wikilink">Eric Blom</a> tells the story (without revealing the source) of how the Archduchess helped Wolfgang when he slipped on the polished floor, and received a proposal of marriage in return.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>As the Mozarts began to be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often required to give several performances during a single day.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> They were well rewarded for this activity—at the end of their first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with <a href="scarlet_fever" title="wikilink">scarlet fever</a>, and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="preparations">Preparations</h3>
<p><img src="Leopold_Mozart.jpg" title="fig:Leopold Mozart, circa. 1765" alt="Leopold Mozart, circa. 1765" /> In a letter to his friend and landlord Lorenz Hagenauer (1712&lt;U+2013&gt;1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the words of the German diplomat <a href="Friedrich_Melchior,_Baron_von_Grimm" title="wikilink">Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm</a>, who had said, after hearing the children play: &quot;Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Leopold believed that it was his duty to his country, his prince and his God to proclaim this miracle to the world, by showing Nannerl and Wolfgang to the highest European society, otherwise he would be the most ungrateful creature.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It has been suggested by Mozart biographer <a href="Wolfgang_Hildesheimer" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Hildesheimer</a> that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: &quot;Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically stymied by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the <a href="Austrian_Netherlands" title="wikilink">Austrian Netherlands</a>, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Holland trip was an unplanned detour.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals, Leopold relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> These would enable them to obtain money <em>en route</em>, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to roll in.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently without any tuition whatsoever.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As for more general preparation, the children delighted in making music together, something they never lost.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice and appear to thrive on the hectic schedule.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, on the grounds that the Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="early-stages-julynovember-1763">Early stages (July–November 1763)</h3>
<p>The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on the first day a carriage wheel broke, necessitating a 24-hour interlude while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage, by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at <a href="Wasserburg_am_Inn" title="wikilink">Wasserburg</a>, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedals as if he had been studying it for months.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 <a href="Austro-Hungarian_gulden" title="wikilink">gulden</a> or <a href="Austro-Hungarian_gulden" title="wikilink">florins</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The next stop was <a href="Augsburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augsburg</a>, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The family then moved on to <a href="Schwetzingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schwetzingen</a> and the <a href="Mannheim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mannheim</a> court, where the children's performance apparently amazed <a href="Charles_Theodore,_Elector_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Elector Palatine Karl Theodor</a> and his <a href="Countess_Elizabeth_Augusta_of_Sulzbach" title="wikilink">Electress</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The next extended stop was at <a href="Mainz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mainz</a>, from which the family took a boat journey up the River <a href="Main" class="uri" title="wikilink">Main</a> to Frankfurt, where several public concerts were given. Among those present at the first of these was the fourteen-year-old <a href="Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="wikilink">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, who would many years later recall &quot;the little fellow with his wig and his sword&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> An advertisement for these concerts announced that &quot;the girl&quot; would play &quot;the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters&quot;, while &quot;the boy&quot; would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth. Finally &quot;he will improvise out of his head, not only on the fortepiano but also on the organ...in all the keys, even the most difficult, that he may be asked&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <img src="Goethe.jpg" title="fig:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe saw the infant prodigies perform in Frankfurt in 1765." alt="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe saw the infant prodigies perform in Frankfurt in 1765." /> After several more weeks in Mainz the family took another riverboat to <a href="Koblenz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Koblenz</a>, thence to <a href="Bonn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonn</a> and <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a>. At <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a> a performance was given before <a href="Princess_Anna_Amalia_of_Prussia" title="wikilink">Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia</a>, the sister of <a href="Frederick_the_Great" title="wikilink">Frederick the Great</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The princess tried to persuade Leopold to abandon his itinerary and go to <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, but Leopold resisted. &quot;She has no money,&quot; he wrote to Hagenauer, recounting that she had repaid the performance with kisses. &quot;Howbeit, neither mine host nor the postmaster are to be contented with kisses.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The next stage of the journey took them to the Austrian Netherlands,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> where they visited <a href="Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge</a> before arriving in the regional capital, Brussels, on 5 October. After a long wait for the governor-general, <a href="Prince_Charles_of_Lorraine" title="wikilink">Prince Charles of Lorraine</a>, to summon them (&quot;His highness the prince does nothing but hunt, gobble and swill&quot;, wrote Leopold to Hagenauer),<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> a grand concert was held in the prince's presence on 7 November. On the 15th the family departed for Paris.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>During the long hiatus in Brussels Wolfgang turned his attention briefly from performing to composing. On 14 October he finished an <a href="List_of_musical_terms#A" title="wikilink">Allegro</a> for harpsichord, which would later be incorporated into the <a href="Sonata_in_C_for_Keyboard_and_Violin_(Mozart)" title="wikilink">C major sonata, K.6</a>,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> which he completed in Paris.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold sought other engagements.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Biographer Eric Blom writes that the family was initially ignored,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> although Leopold's letters record appearances at several noble houses. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: &quot;the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This is close to Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later: &quot;My little girl, although only 12 years old, is one of the most skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>On 24 December the family moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was reportedly allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan <a href="Madame_de_Pompadour" title="wikilink">Madame de Pompadour</a>, then in the last months of her life—&quot;an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything&quot;, according to Leopold.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to stand on a chair to be examined by the Madame, who would not allow him to kiss her.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <img src="Boupomp3_2.jpg" title="fig:Madame de Pompadour, whom the Mozart&#39;s met at Versailles, 1763–64" alt="Madame de Pompadour, whom the Mozart&#39;s met at Versailles, 1763–64" /> There is no record of the children giving a formal concert at Versailles. In February 1764 they were given 50 <a href="louis_d&#39;or" title="wikilink">louis d'or</a> (about 550 florins) and a gold snuff-box by the royal entertainments office, presumably for entertaining the royal family privately, but no more details are available.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Further concerts were given in Paris on 10 March and on 9 April, at a private theatre in the rue et Porte St Honor&lt;U+00E9&gt;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> At this time Wolfgang's first published works were printed: two pairs of sonatas for harpsichord and violin, K.6 and 7, and K.8 and 9. These pairs became Opus 1 and Opus 2 in Leopold's private catalogue of his son's work.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The first pair was dedicated to the king's daughter, <a href="Princess_Victoire_of_France" title="wikilink">Madame Victoire de France</a>, the second to the Countess of Tess&lt;U+00E9&gt;. In writing these sonatas Wolfgang developed material that had originally been written as harpsichord solos, and included the Allegro he had composed in Brussels in the first of the series, K.6 in C major. This consists of four movements, whereas the subsequent sonatas, <a href="K._7" title="wikilink">in D major K.7</a>, in B flat major K.8, and in G major K.9, are more conventional three movement works.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Mozart biographer Stanley Sadie comments that some aspects of the pieces are rather childish and na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve, but that nevertheless, their technique is &quot;astonishingly sure, their line of thinking is clear and smooth, and their formal balance is beyond reproach&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>A decision was taken in Paris to go to London, perhaps on the advice of Leopold's musical and court acquaintances, who would probably have advised him that England was, in Mozart scholar <a href="Neal_Zaslaw" title="wikilink">Neal Zaslaw</a>'s words, &quot;known for the enthusiasm with which it received continental musicians and the extravagance with which it rewarded them&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> On 10 April the family left for <a href="Calais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calais</a> and after an unpleasant crossing to <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a> on a hired boat, and some delays, arrived in London on 23 April.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the following day.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June at <a href="Ranelagh_Pleasure_Gardens" title="wikilink">Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens</a>. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as &quot;a way to earn the love of this very special nation&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Wolfgang was advertised as &quot;...the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...&quot; (he was in fact eight), &quot;justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> On 8 July there was a private performance at the <a href="Grosvenor_Square" title="wikilink">Grosvenor Square</a> home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> &quot;Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events&quot;, he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court Lodgings to a house in the countryside, in <a href="Ebury_Street" title="wikilink">Ebury Street</a>, then considered part of the village of <a href="Chelsea,_London" title="wikilink">Chelsea</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <img src="Brown_plaque_Mozart.jpg" title="fig:Plaque on the house in Ebury Street, where the Mozarts stayed in the summer of 1765" alt="Plaque on the house in Ebury Street, where the Mozarts stayed in the summer of 1765" /></p>
<p>During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to the composition of symphonies.

<p>The party had survived major setbacks, including several prolonged illnesses which had curtailed their earning powers. Although Leopold did not reveal the full extent of the tour's earnings, or its expenses,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerable—but so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts (&quot;gewgaws&quot;) alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Leopold stated that &quot;there was nothing to be saved, because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had &quot;very little money&quot;.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>Mozart's creative progress is likewise reflected in the sonatas composed for the Princess of Orange, which, according to Sadie, mark a considerable advance in technique and ideas over the earlier Paris and London sets.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> The arias composed in Holland include Mozart's first attempts at &quot;aria d'affetto&quot;, <em>Per pi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ta, bell'idol mio</em>, K.73b, once thought to have been composed much later, as its higher K number indicates.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The tour thus saw Wolfgang's transformation from a composer of simple keyboard pieces to one with increasing mastery over a range of genres. This was evidenced in his home city, on 8 December, when one of his symphonies (it is uncertain which) was performed at High Mass at <a href="Salzburg_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Salzburg Cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Leopold's employer, the Prince-Archbishop, was frankly skeptical about Wolfgang's compositions, believing them to be Leopold's because they were &quot;not nearly bad enough to be the work of a child&quot;.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Whatever the true extent of their financial rewards from the tour, the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped apartment on the Getreidegasse, while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> However, travel and public display dominated the next six years of Wolfgang's life. In September 1767 the family was on the move again, this time to Vienna, remaining there (apart from an enforced evacuation during a <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a> epidemic) until January 1769.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italy—without Nannerl who, now 18, was no longer exhibitable as a child wonder.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> They were away for sixteen months, and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months, to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang's opera <a href="Ascanio_in_Alba" title="wikilink"><em>Ascanio in Alba</em></a>.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> A third and final visit to Italy, from October 1772 until March 1773, was the last of the extended trips; the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, <a href="Count_Hieronymus_von_Colloredo" title="wikilink">Hieronymous Colloredo</a>, had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians, which precluded the freedoms that Leopold—and now Wolfgang, himself employed by the court<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;had formerly enjoyed.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
