<p><strong>Xorr the God-Jewel</strong> is a fictional character in the <a href="Marvel_Universe" title="wikilink">Marvel Universe</a>.</p>
<p>Six million years ago, a humanoid race covered its planet with a nuclear force shield for protection when its sun went nova. The planet wandered through space after the nova occurred, and somewhat slowly contracted to a fraction of its former size. The energy of the shield caused the planet to turn into a crystalline body. By then the planet had absorbed the life forces of its humanoid inhabitants and had become sentient. It called itself Xorr the God-Jewel, accumulated more energy by destroying worlds, and planned to conquer the universe.</p>
<p>Eventually, the force of a nova reduced Xorr to drifting debris, much of which was collected by the <a href="List_of_Marvel_Comics_alien_races#G" title="wikilink">Gramosians</a> led by <a href="Mercurio_the_4-D_Man" title="wikilink">Mercurio</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Xorr claimed that its humanoid inhabitants were responsible for creating all humanoid races, including <a href="Homo_sapiens_(Marvel_Comics)" title="wikilink">Earth humans</a>, the <a href="Skrull" title="wikilink">Skrulls</a>, and the <a href="Kree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kree</a>. However, Xorr's humanoids have no known connection with the <a href="Celestial_(comics)" title="wikilink">Celestials</a>, who did influence human and Skrull evolution, and there is no evidence to support these claims of Xorr's.</p>
