<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>KQED was organized and created by veteran <a href="journalist" title="wikilink">broadcast journalists</a> <a href="James_Day_(journalist)" title="wikilink">James Day</a> and <a href="Jonathan_Rice" title="wikilink">Jonathan Rice</a> <a href="June_1" title="wikilink">June 1</a>, <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a> and first went on air <a href="April_5" title="wikilink">April 5</a>, <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>. It was the sixth <a href="public_broadcasting" title="wikilink">public broadcasting</a> station in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, debuting shortly after <a href="WQED_(TV)" title="wikilink">WQED</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. The station's <a href="call_letters" title="wikilink">call letters</a>, <em><a href="Q.E.D." class="uri" title="wikilink">Q.E.D.</a></em>, literally translated from the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> phrase, <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em>, meaning <em>which was to be demonstrated.</em></p>
<p>In its early days following sign-on, KQED broadcast only twice a week for one hour each day. Despite the very limited schedule, the station was still losing money, leading to a decision in early 1955 from its board of trustees to close down the station. Its staff got the board to keep the station on the air and try to get needed funds from the public in a form of a televised <a href="auction" class="uri" title="wikilink">auction</a>, in which celebrities would appear to auction off goods and services donated to the station. While the station still came a little short, it did show that the general public cared to keep KQED on the air. Since then, the auction became a fund-raising tool for many public television stations, though its usage waned in recent years in favor of increased usage of special <a href="pledge_drive" title="wikilink">pledge drives</a> throughout the year.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Channel 9 had a <a href="sister_station" title="wikilink">sister station</a>, <a href="KMTP-TV" title="wikilink">KQEC</a>, which broadcast on Channel 32. KQED had inherited the station in 1970 (as KNEW-TV) from <a href="Metromedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metromedia</a>, but found they could not operate it without losing money. Various PBS and locally produced programs from KQED would air erratically and at different times of the day on KQEC. In 1988, the <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) revoked KQED's license to operate KQEC, citing excessive off-air time, further charging dishonesty in previous filings with regard to the specific reasons. The alleged dishonesty was in reference to KQED's claim of financial woes for keeping KQEC off the air for most of 1972 through 1977, and again for several months in 1979 and 1980. After being revoked from KQED, the reassigned license was granted to the <a href="Minority_Television_Project" title="wikilink">Minority Television Project</a> (MTP), one of the challengers of the KQED/KQEC filing.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The KQEC call letters were changed to <a href="KMTP-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">KMTP-TV</a> under the new license.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_1" title="wikilink">May 1</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, <strong>KQED, Inc.</strong> and the <strong><a href="KTEH" class="uri" title="wikilink">KTEH</a> Foundation</strong> merged to form <strong><a href="Northern_California_Public_Broadcasting" title="wikilink">Northern California Public Broadcasting</a></strong>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The KQED assets including its <a href="television_station" title="wikilink">television</a> (KQED TV) and <a href="radio_stations" title="wikilink">FM radio stations</a> (KQED-FM) were taken under the umbrella of that new organization. Both remain members of <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)</a> and <a href="National_Public_Radio" title="wikilink">National Public Radio (NPR)</a>, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="televising-executions"><em>Televising executions</em></h3>
<p>During the early 1990s, when the State of <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> reinstituted the <a href="death_penalty" title="wikilink">death penalty</a>, the KQED organization waged a highly controversial legal battle for the right to televise the forthcoming <a href="Execution_(legal)" title="wikilink">execution</a> of <a href="Robert_Alton_Harris" title="wikilink">Robert Alton Harris</a> at <a href="San_Quentin" title="wikilink">San Quentin</a> State Prison.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The decision to pursue the videotaping of executions was controversial amongst those on both sides of the <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">capital punishment</a> debate;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> contemporary reports noted that a number of KQED's members (primarily <a href="families" class="uri" title="wikilink">families</a> throughout the <a href="San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="wikilink">Bay Area</a>) dropped their financial support for the station, intending for their <a href="charitable_contributions" title="wikilink">charitable contributions</a> to KQED to support programs such as <a href="Sesame_Street" title="wikilink">Sesame Street</a> rather than legal fees.</p>
<h3 id="tales-of-the-city"><em>Tales of the City</em></h3>
<p>KQED was co-producer of the television adaptation of <a href="Armistead_Maupin" title="wikilink">Armistead Maupin</a>'s novel, <em><a href="Tales_of_the_City" title="wikilink">Tales of the City</a></em>, which aired on PBS stations nationwide in January 1994. The six-part miniseries stirred controversy over the gay themes, nudity and illicit drug use in this fictional portrayal of life in 1970s San Francisco. The controversy led to calls from the public to cancel the series, a bomb threat at <a href="WTCI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WTCI</a> in <a href="Chattanooga,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, which forced that station to pull the program an hour before airtime, and threats from state and federal governments to cut funding for the network and its stations. Although the program gave PBS its highest ratings ever for a dramatic program, the network decided to forgo participation in the production of an adaptation of the second book in the series, <em><a href="More_Tales_of_the_City_(novel)" title="wikilink">More Tales of the City</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>
<p>In 1955, KQED began publishing a programming guide called <em>KQED in Focus</em>. The program guide began to add more articles and took on the character of a regular <a href="magazine" class="uri" title="wikilink">magazine</a>. The name was later changed to <em>Focus Magazine</em> and then to <em>San Francisco Focus</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1984, a new programming guide, <em>Fine Tuning</em> was separated off from <em>Focus</em>, with <em>Focus</em> carrying on as a self-contained magazine.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the early 1990s, <em>San Francisco Focus</em> was the recipient of number of journalism and publishing awards, including a <a href="National_Headliner_Award" title="wikilink">National Headliner Award</a> for feature writing in 1993. In 1997, KQED sold <em>San Francisco Focus</em> to Diablo Publications in order to pay off debts.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 2005, <em>San Francisco Focus</em> was resold to Modern Luxury Media, who rebranded the magazine as <em><a href="San_Francisco_(magazine)" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
