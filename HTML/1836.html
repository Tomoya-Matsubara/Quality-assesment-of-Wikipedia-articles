<p>Wilson Peak is climbed by hundreds each year, primarily in summer months, but winter ascents are not unusual and sometimes serve as the beginning of <a href="backcountry_skiing" title="wikilink">backcountry skiing</a> descents. Summer ascents of the peak are considered <a href="Yosemite_Decimal_System" title="wikilink">Class 3</a> technical climbs, meaning that scrambling over rock is required (with hand holds being used for balance) and ropes typically not employed.

Use of this route has come into question since 2004 when private landowners failed to come to an agreement with the <a href="US_Forest_Service" title="wikilink">US Forest Service</a> regarding hiking access. Government signs now warn against trespassing along the traditional route.</p>
