<p>The <strong>Amruteshvara temple</strong> () is located in the town of Amruthapura, 67 km north of <a href="Chikmagalur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chikmagalur</a> town in the <a href="Chikkamagaluru_district" title="wikilink">Chikkamagaluru district</a> of the <a href="Karnataka" title="wikilink">Karnataka state</a>, <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>. Located 110 km from <a href="Hassan,_India" title="wikilink">Hassan</a> and 35 km from <a href="Shimoga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shimoga</a> on NH 206, Amruthapura is known for the splendid Amruteshvara temple (also often spelt <em>Amruthesvara</em> or <em>Amrtesvara</em>). The temple was built in 1196 C.E. by Amrutheshwara <em>Dandanayaka</em> (<em>lit</em>, &quot;commander&quot;) under <a href="Hoysala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoysala</a> King <a href="Veera_Ballala_II" title="wikilink">Veera Ballala II</a>. It is located in an idyllic spot, in the close vicinity of the <a href="Bhadra_River" title="wikilink">Bhadra River</a> reservoir. The rise of the Hoysala power in the 11th-12th centuries created many important towns and cities (<em>nagara</em>) along the <a href="malnad" class="uri" title="wikilink">malnad</a> (hill) regions of present day Karnataka where they built many ornate temples.</p>

<p>The temple is a fine example of 12th century <a href="Hoysala_architecture" title="wikilink">Hoysala architecture</a> with a wide open <em>mantapa</em> (hall).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Surrounded by <a href="Arecaceae" title="wikilink">Palm</a> and <a href="Coconut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coconut</a> farms, the temple still has a well preserved original outer wall with interesting, equally spaced circular carvings. The temple has one <em><a href="Vimana_(shrine)" title="wikilink">vimana</a></em> (shrine and tower) and therefore is a <em>ekakuta</em> design,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and has a closed <em>mantapa</em> (hall) that connects the sanctum to the large open <em><a href="mantapa" class="uri" title="wikilink">mantapa</a></em>.</p>

<p>It is medium sized Hoysala temple and compares closely with the <a href="Veera_Narayana_Temple,_Belavadi" title="wikilink">Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi</a> in <em>mandapa</em> structure and size. The open <em>mandapa</em> has twenty nine bays,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the closed <em>mantapa</em> has nine bays with a side porch that leads to a separate shrine on the south side. The shrine is square in shape has the original superstructure (<em><a href="sikhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">sikhara</a></em>) which is richly adorned with sculptures of <em><a href="Kirthimukha" title="wikilink">Kirthimukhas</a></em> (demon faces), miniature decorative towers (<a href="aedicule" class="uri" title="wikilink">aedicule</a>). Below the superstructure, the usual panel of <a href="Hindu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> deities is absent. The base of the wall has five mouldings which according to art critic Foekema is an &quot;older Hoysala style&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <em>Sukanasi</em>, the tower on top of the <a href="Vestibule_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vestibule</a> that connects the sanctum to the closed <em>mantapa</em> (the <em>Sukanasi</em> appears like the nose of the superstructure),<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> has the original Hoysala emblem of &quot;Sala&quot; fighting the lion.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The rows of shining lathe turned pillars that support the ceiling of the <em>mantapa</em> is a Hoysala-Chalukya decorative idiom.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <em>mantapa</em> has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open <em>mantapa</em> has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The <a href="Ramayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramayana</a> is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god <a href="Krishna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krishna</a> and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic <a href="Mahabharata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahabharata</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Ruvari Mallitamma, the famous sculptor and architect is known to have started his career here working on the domed ceilings in the main <em>mantapa</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The large stone inscription near the porch is an excellent example of medieval Kannada poetry composed by the famous poet <a href="Janna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Janna</a>.</p>
