<p><strong>Andrew Gary &quot;Joey&quot; Johns</strong> (born <a href="19_May" title="wikilink">19 May</a> <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a> in <a href="Cessnock,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Cessnock</a>, <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>) is a former <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a> footballer. He is considered one of the modern greats of the game, and heralded as the world's best <a href="Rugby_league_positions#Scrum-half" title="wikilink">halfback</a> for a number of years. By many he is considered to be the best player ever to set foot on a rugby league field. In the <a href="The_Daily_Telegraph_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Daily Telegraph</a> on the 11th of April 2007, one day after retiring, many of the games greats, including some of the &quot;<a href="The_Immortals_(rugby_league)" title="wikilink">Immortals</a>&quot; called for him to be made an immortal of the game. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Johns and <a href="Darren_Lockyer" title="wikilink">Darren Lockyer</a> are the only players to have won the <a href="RLIF_Golden_Boot_Awards" title="wikilink">Golden Boot award</a> more than once. Johns has also won the Dally M medal for best player more than once. Johns finished his career as the highest points scorer in Australian first grade premiership history with 2,176 points.</p>
<p>Johns captained the <a href="Newcastle_Knights" title="wikilink">Newcastle Knights</a> in the <a href="National_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">National Rugby League</a>, for whom he played a record 249 games. He also represented his country at two <a href="Rugby_League_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cups</a>, and one <a href="Australian_national_rugby_league_team" title="wikilink">Kangaroos</a> tour, playing in 21 Test matches for the <a href="Australian_national_rugby_league_team" title="wikilink">national side</a>. Johns played in 23 games for <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> in <a href="Rugby_League_State_of_Origin" title="wikilink">State of Origin</a> (captaining the side to a series win in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>), and twice for the <a href="New_South_Wales_Country_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">Country Origin</a> side in 1995 and <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>.</p>
<p>He announced his retirement from rugby league on <a href="10_April" title="wikilink">10 April</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> at the age of 32. This followed a long run of injuries, the last of which was a bulging disk in his neck suffered in his last game against the <a href="Canberra_Raiders" title="wikilink">Canberra Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Newcastle_Knights" title="wikilink">Newcastle Knights</a> have only won once in the past 10 years without him and play maker <a href="Danny_Buderus" title="wikilink">Danny Buderus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="football-career">Football career</h2>
<h3 id="early-days">Early days</h3>
<p>Johns was born in <a href="Cessnock,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Cessnock</a>, in the <a href="Hunter_Valley" title="wikilink">Hunter Valley</a> region of <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, a <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a> heartland inland from Newcastle. He is the second of two children born to Gary and Gayle Johns. He has one older brother <a href="Matthew_Johns" title="wikilink">Matthew</a>. His father Gary is a former coal miner, highly respected Cessnock &quot;Goannas&quot; rugby league player and later captain/coach. Andrew initially played <a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">soccer</a> from a young age, showing great promise.</p>
<p>After playing junior rugby league in Cessnock and Newcastle League rival Kurri Kurri Bulldogs, Johns joined the <a href="Newcastle_Knights" title="wikilink">Newcastle Knights</a> in 1989. Although he was tested off the bench in the <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_season_1993" title="wikilink">1993 season</a>, he made his first grade debut in the starting line up in 1994, when, in the last trial of the year, Matthew Rodwell, Newcastle's regular halfback sustained a knee injury, giving Johns an opportunity against the <a href="South_Sydney_Rabbitohs" title="wikilink">South Sydney Rabbitohs</a>. In his debut match he scored 23 points and won the man-of-the-match award, making an immediate impact. He soon formed a partnership with his older brother Matthew, who played <a href="Rugby_league_positions#Five-Eighth" title="wikilink">five-eighth</a>.</p>
<h3 id="section">1995-2001</h3>
<p>The <a href="Australian_Rugby_League_season_1995" title="wikilink">1995 season</a> saw prosperous times for Johns, as he was picked to represent <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> in the <a href="Rugby_League_State_of_Origin" title="wikilink">State of Origin</a> competition and went on to play in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>'s successful retention of the <a href="Rugby_League_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cup</a> in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. Success for Johns continued through into the <a href="Australian_Rugby_League_season_1996" title="wikilink">1996 season</a>, until mid-season when he began to tire. Johns began to question what value rugby league was in his life. Following a surfing holiday to the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> at the end of the season, Johns began a journey of self-discovery. After witnessing the poverty of the natives in that country, he realised how lucky he really was.</p>
<p>Putting 1996 behind him, he played a pivotal role when the Knights reached the <a href="Australian_Rugby_League_season_1997" title="wikilink">1997 ARL</a> grand final against <a href="Manly-Warringah_Sea_Eagles" title="wikilink">Manly</a>. There were grave concerns that Johns would be unable to play the game, as he had a received three broken ribs and a punctured lung only a fortnight ago. Local newspaper headlines even read &quot;You Will Die&quot;. However, Johns defied the odds to play, and was able to win the game for the Knights by setting up a try for <a href="Darren_Albert" title="wikilink">Darren Albert</a> with six seconds remaining in the game.</p>
<p>The partnership with his brother was broken in 2000 when salary cap pressures forced Matthew to leave the club and join <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> club <a href="Wigan_Warriors" title="wikilink">Wigan</a>. Also that year, Andrew was awarded the <a href="Australian_Sports_Medal" title="wikilink">Australian Sports Medal</a> for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Johns would soon become captain of the Knights, despite initial concerns after the retirement of <a href="Paul_Harragon" title="wikilink">Paul Harragon</a>, and lead them to another grand final win,where he starred, defeating the <a href="Parramatta_Eels" title="wikilink">Parramatta Eels</a> 30-24 in <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2001" title="wikilink">2001</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Clive_Churchill_Medal" title="wikilink">Clive Churchill Medal</a> for man of the match.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2002-2005</h3>
<p>In <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2002" title="wikilink">2002</a>, Johns was awarded the captaincy of both <a href="New_South_Wales_rugby_league_team" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Australia_national_rugby_league_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, going on to win the title of player of the series against <a href="Great_Britain_national_rugby_league_team" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>. He also won the <a href="Dally_M_Medal" title="wikilink">Dally M Medal</a> for a record third time, a feat achieved by none other to-date.</p>
<p>Johns has been plagued by injury in the past few seasons, often before or during the finals series. He injured his neck and damaged the ligaments in his left ankle when he rolled it. He broke his jaw in 2005, sustained an <a href="anterior_cruciate_ligament" title="wikilink">anterior cruciate ligament</a> injury which kept him out of most of the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2004" title="wikilink">2004 season</a>, he had a serious neck injury that threatened his career in 2003 and he broke his back during the 2002 finals.</p>
<p>Johns created a national debate in 2004 after receiving a massive offer from rugby union to switch codes. Numerous past legends of both codes expressed their opinions, and the only thing everybody agreed on was the fact Johns would be a star for the <a href="Australia_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Wallabies</a> if he switched codes. After <a href="David_Gallop" title="wikilink">David Gallop</a>, the <a href="Chief_executive_officer" title="wikilink">CEO</a> of the <a href="National_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">NRL</a>, and <a href="Nine_Network" title="wikilink">Channel Nine</a> contributed money and a promise of a commentary position after his career finished, Johns finally decided to stay in league, ending months of speculation and debate. He says his decision was massively affected by his son, who wanted him to stay in league.</p>
<p>In June <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Johns was picked to replace <a href="Brett_Kimmorley" title="wikilink">Brett Kimmorley</a> in the <a href="New_South_Wales_Rugby_League" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> <a href="Rugby_League_State_of_Origin" title="wikilink">State of Origin</a> squad. The second game in the series was his first in returning from a series of injuries that sidelined him for a number of weeks. Johns went on to command the game, receiving man of the match honours and absolutely blitzing the stunned Queensland team. He also went on to play in the deciding third game of the series, having a similar effect.</p>
<p>In August 2005, it was announced that Johns would be joining the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> side <a href="Warrington_Wolves" title="wikilink">Warrington Wolves</a> on a short-term deal, playing in the final two games of the regular <a href="Super_League_(Europe)" title="wikilink">Super League</a> and any playoff games the Wolves might get to. The Knights first made him sign a new contract, making him available to captain the team until the end of 2008.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2006</h3>
<p>Johns scored 30 points against <a href="Canberra_Raiders" title="wikilink">Canberra</a> in <a href="2006_NRL_season#Round_2" title="wikilink">Round 2</a> of the 2006 competition, and in doing so claimed the point scoring record for a single club, surpassing <a href="Mick_Cronin_(rugby_league_footballer)" title="wikilink">Mick Cronin's</a> 1,971 points for <a href="Parramatta_Eels" title="wikilink">Parramatta</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="5_May" title="wikilink">5 May</a>, Johns played in his 21st and final Test match for the Kangaroos at <a href="Suncorp_Stadium" title="wikilink">Suncorp Stadium</a> in <a href="Brisbane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a>, with Australia defeating New Zealand by 50 points to 12.</p>
<p>On <a href="30_June" title="wikilink">30 June</a>, it was announced that Johns would play for the <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">NSW cricket side</a> for their <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> series; which sparked a lot of media interest, with some suspecting a public relations stunt. Johns was reported in the media admitting that he could neither bat nor bowl very well.</p>
<p>On <a href="8_July" title="wikilink">8 July</a> against the Parramatta Eels, Johns converted a try scored by Riley Brown and became the highest point scorer in Australian first grade rugby league history, eclipsing <a href="Jason_Taylor_(rugby_league_footballer)" title="wikilink">Jason Taylor</a>'s previous record of 2,107 points. This came, ironically, in a 46-12 loss to the Eels who were coached by Taylor.</p>
<p>During a round 24 match against Manly, controversy struck as Johns audibly called side line official Matt Cecchin a &quot;fucking cunt&quot;. In the following days the event created immense media hype with Johns eventually being suspended for two weeks with a contrary conduct charge. Later, when appealing the weighting of the contrary conduct charge, Johns formally apologised.</p>
<h2 id="retirement">Retirement</h2>
<p>On <a href="10_April" title="wikilink">10 April</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Johns announced his retirement from rugby league because of a bulging disc in his neck. He told team-mates of his plans to retire in the hour before the press conference. Johns injured his neck against the <a href="Canberra_Raiders" title="wikilink">Canberra Raiders</a> in the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2007#Round_3" title="wikilink">third round</a> of the <a href="National_Rugby_League_season_2007" title="wikilink">2007 season</a> before suffering a recurrence of the problem at training the following Thursday. Johns was obviously shattered by the event but was seriously considering retirement at the end of the 2007 season and was quoted in the press conference as saying &quot;I knew this year would be my last year, it's just unfortunate it's stopped five months before the end of the season.&quot; Commenting on his teammates reaction to his retirement, Johns noted &quot;They were sort of relieved I think, after a couple of injuries this year ... I think the time's right,&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It was the second occasion Johns suffered a serious neck injury after his 2003 season was brought to a premature halt due to an identical injury..<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Andrew's brother <a href="Matthew_Johns" title="wikilink">Matthew Johns</a> retired with the same injury. Matthew was telling him for the whole week to retire because 'Joey had nothing left to prove in the game'.</p>
<h2 id="events-after-retirement">Events after retirement</h2>

<p>On <a href="22_April" title="wikilink">22 April</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> The Newcastle Knights held a tribute to Andrew Johns before their game against the Brisbane Broncos. The new grand stand at Energy Australia Stadium was named &quot;The Andrew Johns Stand&quot; and as Andrew uttered his last words before walking his last lap of honour, he was fighting back tears</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the tribute show a limited edition Andrew Johns T-Shirt was released which read &quot;Our Finest Knight&quot; on the front and on the reverse, a list of his achievements.</p>

<h2 id="cricket-career">Cricket career</h2>
<p>On <a href="30_June" title="wikilink">30 June</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> it was announced that Johns would play for the <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">New South Wales cricket side</a> for their <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> series. This sparked a lot of media interest, with some suspecting it being a <a href="public_relations" title="wikilink">public relations</a> stunt. Johns was reported in the media admitting that he could neither bat nor bowl very well.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Johns played in two Twenty20 cricket matches in <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>. In the first game, against <a href="Southern_Redbacks" title="wikilink">Southern Redbacks</a>, Johns fumbled numerous <a href="fielding_(cricket)" title="wikilink">fielding</a> attempts, and failed to take a wicket when he <a href="Bowling_(cricket)" title="wikilink">bowled</a>. During the New South Wales innings it was very controversial. He came in at number 11 and faced one ball in the second last over, during which he was lucky not to be stumped.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the last over <a href="Simon_Katich" title="wikilink">Simon Katich</a> was on strike and hit the ball to <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">long on</a> but refused to run, lest Johns be forced to bat again. This sparked a fair amount of anger from the crowd.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This forced the blues to lose and rule them out of the finals series. In the second game he played, against the <a href="Tasmanian_Tigers" title="wikilink">Tasmanian Tigers</a> he came in at number 9 and scored a respectable 9 runs of 10 balls. Despite this, the Blues lost the match by 37 runs and finished last on the ladder.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
