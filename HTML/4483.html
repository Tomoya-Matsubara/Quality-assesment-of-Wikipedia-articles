<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="montreal-expos">Montreal Expos</h3>
<p>The <a href="Montreal_Expos" title="wikilink">Montreal Expos</a> selected Raines in the 5th round of the 1977 amateur draft. After debuting with six games as a <a href="pinch_runner" title="wikilink">pinch runner</a> in , he played briefly as a <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second baseman</a> for the Expos in , but soon switched to playing the outfield, and rapidly became a fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths. In his <a href="1981_Major_League_Baseball_strike" title="wikilink">strike</a>-interrupted  rookie season, he batted .304 and stole 71 bases â€“ then the second most ever by a rookie, behind only <a href="Benny_Kauff" title="wikilink">Benny Kauff</a>'s 75 for the  <a href="Indianapolis_Hoosiers" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Hoosiers</a> in the <a href="Federal_League" title="wikilink">Federal League</a>. Raines was caught stealing for the first time in 1981, after having begun his career with a major league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases. Raines was the runner-up for the NL's <a href="Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Rookie of the Year Award</a> in 1981, which was won by <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> pitcher <a href="Fernando_Valenzuela" title="wikilink">Fernando Valenzuela</a>.</p>
<p>Raines performance dipped in 1982,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> as he hit .277 with a .353 on base percentage.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At the end of the season, Raines entered treatment for substance abuse, having spent an estimated $40,000 that year on cocaine.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> To avoid leaving the drug in his locker, Raines carried it in his hip pocket, and slid headfirst when running the bases.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He used cocaine before games, in his car, after games, and on some occasions, between innings in the clubhouse.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Raines testified in September, 1985 at the infamous <a href="Pittsburgh_drug_trials" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh drug trials</a>.</p>
<p>In 1983, Raines resumed his exciting play, stealing a career high of 90 bases. In each season from 1981 to 1986, Raines stole at least 70 bases. He had a career-high .334 batting average in 1986, winning the National League batting title. Raines maintained a consistently high on base percentage during this period and a rising slugging percentage, reaching a career peak of .429 in 1987. Although he never won a <a href="Gold_Glove_Award" title="wikilink">Gold Glove Award</a>, Raines was an excellent defensive player who led the NL with 21 <a href="assist_(baseball)" title="wikilink">assists</a> in 1983 and tied for the league lead with 4 <a href="double_play" title="wikilink">double plays</a> in 1985.</p>
<p>Raines became a free agent on <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a>, ,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> but in spite of his league-leading play, no team made a serious attempt to sign him.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> (During this period, the Major League Baseball owners were acting together to keep salaries down &lt;U+2014&gt; see &quot;<a href="Baseball_collusion" title="wikilink">Baseball collusion</a>&quot;.) On <a href="May_1" title="wikilink">May 1</a>, , hours after being permitted to negotiate again with Montreal, Raines signed a new deal with the Expos for $5,000,000 over three years, and a $900,000 signing bonus.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In his first game back on <a href="May_2" title="wikilink">May 2</a>, facing the Mets, although Raines had not participated in spring training or any other competitive preparation for the season, he hit the first pitch he saw off the right-field wall for a triple.
