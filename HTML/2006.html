<p>The <strong>United States Marine Corps</strong> (<strong>USMC</strong>) is a branch of the <a href="United_States_armed_forces" title="wikilink">U.S. military</a>, responsible for providing <a href="power_projection" title="wikilink">power projection</a> from the sea,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> utilizing the mobility of the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces to global crises. Along with the U.S. Navy, it falls under the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Department of the Navy</a>.</p>
<p>Originally organized as the <a href="Continental_Marines" title="wikilink">Continental Marines</a> in 1775 as naval infantry, the Marine Corps would evolve its mission with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy. Owing to the availability of Marines at sea, the Marine Corps has served in every American conflict. It attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and practice of <a href="amphibious_warfare" title="wikilink">amphibious warfare</a> proved prescient, and ultimately formed a cornerstone of the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By the early 20th century, the Marine Corps would become the dominant theorist and practitioner of amphibious warfare. Its ability to rapidly respond to regional crises has made and continues to make it an important tool for American foreign policy.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The Marine Corps, with 180,000 active and 40,000 reserve Marines as of 2005, is the second-smallest of the U.S. armed forces. Only the <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">U.S. Coast Guard</a> is a smaller military service than the Marine Corps. The Corps is nonetheless larger than the entire armed forces of many significant military powers; for example, it is larger than the <a href="Israeli_Defense_Forces" title="wikilink">Israeli Defense Forces</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p><img src="marine_corps_flag.gif" title="fig:Flag of the U.S. Marine Corps" alt="Flag of the U.S. Marine Corps" /> The Marine Corps serves as an amphibious force in readiness. Today, it has three primary areas of responsibility, as outlined in <em></em>, originally introduced under the <a href="National_Security_Act_of_1947" title="wikilink">National Security Act of 1947</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns</li>
<li>The development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces</li>
<li>&quot;such other duties as the President may direct.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The quoted clause, while seemingly a consequence of the President's position as <a href="Commander_in_Chief" title="wikilink">Commander in Chief</a>, is a codification of the expeditionary duties of the Marine Corps. It derives from similar language in the Congressional Acts <em>&quot;For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps&quot;</em> of 1834, and <em>&quot;Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps&quot;</em> of 1798. In 1951, the <a href="House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a> Armed Services Committee called the clause &quot;one of the most important statutory–and traditional–functions of the Marine Corps&quot;. It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its roles in the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>, <a href="WWI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWI</a> and the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>, its famous actions at <a href="Tripoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tripoli</a> and <a href="Chapultepec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chapultepec</a>, and their numerous counterinsurgency and occupational duties in <a href="Central_America" title="wikilink">Central America</a> and <a href="East_Asia" title="wikilink">East Asia</a>. These actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare. Their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature - using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to its primary duties, the Marine Corps has missions in support of the White House and State Department. President <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Jefferson</a> dubbed the <a href="Marine_Band" title="wikilink">Marine Band</a>, &quot;the President's Own,&quot; for its role of providing music for state functions at the White House.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>In addition, Marines guard presidential retreats, including <a href="Camp_David" title="wikilink">Camp David</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and the Marine unit <a href="HMX-1" class="uri" title="wikilink">HMX-1</a> provides helicopter service to the President. By authority of the 1946 Foreign Service act, Marines of the <a href="Marine_Corps_Security_Guard" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Security Guard</a> provide security for American embassies, legations, and consulates at over 110 <a href="State_Department" title="wikilink">State Department</a> posts overseas.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="historical-mission">Historical mission</h3>
<p>At its founding, the Marine Corps was composed of infantry serving aboard naval vessels, responsible for the security of the ship and her crew by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions, and defending the ship's officers from mutiny. They were also responsible for manning raiding parties. The Marine Corps' role has since expanded significantly. As the importance of its original naval mission declined with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the Naval service, the Corps adapted by focusing on what were formerly secondary missions ashore. The Advanced Base doctrine of the early 20th century codified their combatant duties ashore, outlining the use of Marines in the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval campaigns. The Marines would also develop tactics and techniques of <a href="amphibious_warfare" title="wikilink">amphibious assault</a> on defended coastlines in time for use in <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Its original mission of providing shipboard security finally ended in the 1990's, when the last Marine security detachments were withdrawn from <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> ships.</p>
<h3 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h3>
<p>While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it has the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force anywhere in the world in days. The basic structure for all deployed units is a <a href="Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force" title="wikilink">Marine Air-Ground Task Force</a>(MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat component, an air component, and a combat service support component under a common command element. While the creation of joint commands under the <a href="Goldwater-Nichols_Act" title="wikilink">Goldwater-Nichols Act</a> has improved interservice coordination between the U.S. military services, the Marine Corps' ability to permanently maintain integrated multi-element task forces under a single command provides a smoother implementation of combined-arms warfare principles.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered around the infantry. Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry. Unlike many Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently. For example, Marine Aviation has always been focused on <a href="close_air_support" title="wikilink">close air support</a>, and remained largely uninfluenced by airpower theories proclaiming that <a href="strategic_bombing" title="wikilink">strategic bombing</a> could singlehandedly win wars.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>This focus on the infantry is matched with the notion that &quot;every Marine is a rifleman&quot;, emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine. All enlisted Marines receive training first and foremost as a <a href="rifleman" class="uri" title="wikilink">rifleman</a>; all officers receive training as infantry platoon commanders.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The value of this culture has been demonstrated many times throughout history. At <a href="Battle_of_Wake_Island" title="wikilink">Wake Island</a>, when all the Marine aircraft were shot down, their pilots continued the fight as riflemen, leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The amphibious assault techniques developed for <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a> evolved with the addition of <a href="air_assault" title="wikilink">air assault</a> and <a href="maneuver_warfare" title="wikilink">maneuver warfare</a> doctrine, into the current &quot;Operational Maneuver from the Sea&quot; doctrine of power projection from the seas.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Marines are credited with the development of <a href="Air_assault" title="wikilink">helicopter insertion doctrine</a>, and were the earliest in the American military to widely adopt <a href="maneuver_warfare" title="wikilink">maneuver warfare</a> principles, which emphasize low-level initiative and flexible execution. As a result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the <a href="Non-commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">NCOs</a> (<a href="Corporal" title="wikilink">Corporals</a> and <a href="Sergeant" title="wikilink">Sergeants</a>) as compared to many other military organizations. The Marine Corps pushes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on &quot;commander's intent&quot; as a guiding principle for orders - specifying the endstate but leaving open the method of execution.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The Marine Corps relies upon the Navy for <a href="sealift" class="uri" title="wikilink">sealift</a> to provide its rapid deployment capabilities. In addition to basing a third of the <a href="Marine_Corps_Operating_Forces" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Operating Forces</a> in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="Marine_Expeditionary_Unit" title="wikilink">Marine Expeditionary Unit</a>(MEU)'s, a smaller MAGTF, are typically stationed at sea. This allows them the ability to function as first responders to international incidents. The U.S Army now maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, though they do not match the combined-arms integration of a MAGTF, nor have the logistical train that the Navy provides.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> For this reason, the Marine Corps is often assigned to non-combat missions such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries, and humanitarian relief of natural disasters. In larger conflicts, the Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized. It performed this role in <a href="WWI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWI</a>, the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>, and <a href="Operation_Desert_Storm" title="wikilink">Operation Desert Storm</a>, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>The United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the <a href="Continental_Marines" title="wikilink">Continental Marines</a> of the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>, formed at <a href="Tun_Tavern" title="wikilink">Tun Tavern</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> by a resolution of the <a href="Continental_Congress" title="wikilink">Continental Congress</a> on <a href="November_10" title="wikilink">November 10</a>, <a href="1775" class="uri" title="wikilink">1775</a>. This date is celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the end of the Revolution in 1783, both the <a href="Continental_Navy" title="wikilink">Continental Navy</a> and Marines were disbanded. Though individual Marines were enlisted for the few American naval vessels, the organization would not be re-created until 1798. In preparation for the Naval War with <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, Congress created the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> and Marine Corps.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Marines' most famous action of this period occurred during the <a href="First_Barbary_War" title="wikilink">First Barbary War</a> (1801–1805); <a href="William_Eaton" title="wikilink">William Eaton</a> and First Lieutenant <a href="Presley_O&#39;Bannon" title="wikilink">Presley O'Bannon</a> led eight Marines and 300 <a href="Arab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arab</a> and <a href="European" class="uri" title="wikilink">European</a> <a href="mercenary" title="wikilink">mercenaries</a> in an attempt to capture <a href="Tripoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tripoli</a>. Though they only reached <a href="Battle_of_Derna" title="wikilink">Derna</a>, Tripoli has been immortalized in the <a href="Marines&#39;_Hymn" title="wikilink">Marines' Hymn</a> and the <a href="Mameluke_sword" title="wikilink">Mameluke sword</a> carried by Marine officers.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>, Marine ship detachments took part in the great frigate duels of the war, the first American victories in the conflict. Their most significant contributions came at the <a href="Battle_of_Bladensburg" title="wikilink">Battle of Bladensburg</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">defense of New Orleans</a>. At Bladensburg, they held the line after the Army and militia retreated, and although eventually overrun, inflicted heavy casualties on the British and delayed their march to Washington. At New Orleans, the Marines held the center of Gen. <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a>'s defensive line. By the end of the war Marines acquired a reputation as marksmen, especially in ship to ship actions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>After the war, the Marine Corps fell into an ill state. The third and fourth commandants were court-martialed. However, the appointment of <a href="Archibald_Henderson" title="wikilink">Archibald Henderson</a> as its fifth commandant in 1820 breathed new life into the Corps. He would go on to be the longest-serving commandant. Under his tenure, the Marine Corps took on expeditionary duties in the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a>, the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a>, <a href="Key_West" title="wikilink">Key West</a>, <a href="West_Africa" title="wikilink">West Africa</a>, the <a href="Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands</a>, and <a href="Sumatra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumatra</a>. Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a>'s attempts to combine the Marine Corps with the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Instead, <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> passed the <em>Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps</em> in 1834, stipulating that the Corps was part of the <a href="Department_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Department of the Navy</a>, as a sister service to the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This would be the first of many times that Congress came to the aid of the Marines.</p>
<p><img src="Storming_of_Chapultepec.jpg" title="fig:Storming of Chapultapec" alt="Storming of Chapultapec" width="250" /> When the <a href="Seminole_Wars" title="wikilink">Seminole Wars</a> (1835) broke out, Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service, leading 2 battalions to war - half the strength of the Marine Corps. A decade later, in the <a href="Mexican-American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican-American War</a> (1846–1848), the Marines made their famed <a href="Battle_of_Chapultepec" title="wikilink">assault on Chapultepec Palace</a>, overlooking <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a>. The Marines were placed on guard duty at the Mexican Presidential Palace, &quot;The Halls of Montezuma&quot;. In the 1850's, the Marines would further see service in Panama and Asia, escorting <a href="Matthew_Perry" title="wikilink">Matthew Perry</a>'s <a href="East_India_Squadron" title="wikilink">East India Squadron</a> on its historic trip to the East.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite their vast service in foreign engagements, the Marine Corps played a minor role during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> (1861–1865); their most important task was blockade duty. The battalion of recruits formed for the <a href="First_Battle_of_Bull_Run" title="wikilink">First Battle of Bull Run</a> (First Manassas) performed poorly, retreating with the rest of the Union forces. The Confederate Congress authorized a marine corps of 10 companies, which played little role in the war.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="formative-years">Formative years</h3>
<p>The remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps. The Navy's transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on naval ships. Meanwhile, Marines served as a convenient resource for interventions and landings to protect American lives and property overseas. The Marine Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in the 30 years from the end of the Civil War to the end of the 19th century, including China, Formosa, Japan, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Mexico, Korea, Panama, Hawaii, Egypt, Haiti, Samoa, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. They would also be called upon to stem political and labor unrest within the United States.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> During this period, war correspondent <a href="Richard_Harding_Davis" title="wikilink">Richard Harding Davis</a> coined the phrase &quot;The Marines have landed and have the situation well in hand&quot;. Under Commandant <a href="Jacob_Zeilin" title="wikilink">Jacob Zeilin</a>'s term, Marine customs and traditions took shape. The Corps adopted the <a href="Eagle,_Globe,_and_Anchor" title="wikilink">Marine Corps emblem</a> in 19 November, 1868. It was also during this time that &quot;<a href="Marine&#39;s_hymn" title="wikilink">The Marines' Hymn</a>&quot; was first heard. Around 1883, the Marines adopted their current motto &quot;<a href="Semper_Fidelis" title="wikilink">Semper Fidelis</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sandinoflagusmc.jpg" title="fig:Marines in Nicaragua, 1932" alt="Marines in Nicaragua, 1932" width="200" /> During the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a> (1898), Marines led U.S. forces ashore in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, demonstrating their readiness for deployment. At <a href="Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo_Bay,_Cuba" title="wikilink">Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay, Cuba</a>, Marines seized an <a href="Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base" title="wikilink">advanced naval base</a> that remains in use today. Between 1899 and 1916, the Marine Corps continued its record of participation in foreign expeditions, including the <a href="Philippine-American_War" title="wikilink">Philippine Insurrection</a>, the <a href="Boxer_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Boxer Rebellion</a> (1899–1901), Panama, the Cuban Pacifications, Veracruz, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua. In 1900's and 1910's, the seizure of advance naval bases entered Marine Corps doctrine with the formation of the Marine Corps Advanced Base School and the Advance Base Force, the prototype of the Fleet Marine Force.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, before and after <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the Marines saw action throughout Central America, including <a href="United_States_occupation_of_Haiti_(1915-1934)" title="wikilink">Haiti</a> and <a href="Occupation_of_Nicaragua" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a>. These actions became known as &quot;<a href="The_Banana_Wars" title="wikilink">The Banana Wars</a>&quot;, and the experiences gained in counter-insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were consolidated into the <a href="Small_Wars_Manual" title="wikilink">Small Wars Manual</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p><img src="Scott_Belleau_Wood.jpg" title="fig:Painting of the Battle of Belleau Wood (1918)" alt="Painting of the Battle of Belleau Wood (1918)" width="250" /> In <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, battle-tested, veteran Marines served a central role in the U.S. entry into the conflict. Unlike the U.S. and British armies, the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCO's with battle experience, and experienced a relatively smaller expansion. Here, the Marines fought their celebrated battle at <a href="Battle_of_Belleau_Wood" title="wikilink">Belleau Wood</a>, then the largest in the history of the Corps; it created the Marines' reputation in modern history. Rallying under the battle cries of &quot;Retreat? Hell, we just got here!&quot; (Captain <a href="Lloyd_Williams" title="wikilink">Lloyd Williams</a>) and &quot;Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?&quot; (GySgt. <a href="Dan_Daly" title="wikilink">Dan Daly</a>), the Marines drove German forces from the area. While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' fierceness and toughness earned them the respect of the Germans, who rated them of storm-trooper quality. Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them &quot;Teufel Hunden&quot; or &quot;Devil Dogs&quot;, there is no evidence of this in German records. Nevertheless, the name stuck.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Marine Corps had entered the war with 511 officers and 13,214 enlisted personnel and, by <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a>, <a href="1918" class="uri" title="wikilink">1918</a>, had reached a strength of 2,400 officers and 70,000 men.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the World Wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant <a href="John_A._Lejeune" title="wikilink">John A. Lejeune</a>, another beloved commandant. Under his leadership, the Marine Corps presciently studied and developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a>. Many officers, including LtCol <a href="Earl_Hancock_Ellis" title="wikilink">Earl Hancock &quot;Pete&quot; Ellis</a> foresaw a pacific war with Japan and took preparations for such a conflict. While stationed in China, then LtCol. <a href="Victor_H._Krulak" title="wikilink">Victor H. Krulak</a> observed Japanese amphibious techniques in 1937. Through 1941, as the prospect of war grew, the Marine Corps pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises, and acquired amphibious equipment such as the <a href="Higgins_boat" title="wikilink">Higgins boat</a> which would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h3>
<p>In <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the Marines played a central role in the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific War</a>; the Corps expanded from two <a href="brigade" title="wikilink">brigades</a> to two <a href="corps" class="uri" title="wikilink">corps</a> with six divisions, and five air wings with 132 squadrons. In addition, 20 Defense Battalions and a Parachute Battalion were set up.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The battles of <a href="Battle_of_Guadalcanal" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Tarawa" title="wikilink">Tarawa</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Saipan" title="wikilink">Saipan</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Iwo_Jima" title="wikilink">Iwo Jima</a>, and <a href="Battle_of_Okinawa" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a> saw fierce fighting between U.S. Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army.</p>
<p><img src="WW2_Iwo_Jima_flag_raising.jpg" title="fig:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, by Joe Rosenthal / The Associated Press" alt="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, by Joe Rosenthal / The Associated Press" /> During the battle of Iwo Jima, photographer <a href="Joe_Rosenthal" title="wikilink">Joe Rosenthal</a> took the famous photo <em><a href="Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima" title="wikilink">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a></em> of five Marines and one Navy <a href="corpsman" class="uri" title="wikilink">corpsman</a> raising the American flag on <a href="Mt._Suribachi" title="wikilink">Mt.

By the war&lt;U+2019&gt;s end, the Corps had grown to include six divisions, five air wings and supporting troops totaling about 485,000 Marines. Nearly 87,000 Marines were killed or wounded during WWII and 82 received the <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps faced an immediate institutional crisis following the war. Army generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense establishment also attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army. Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to legislatively dismantle the Corps, resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the <a href="National_Security_Act_of_1947" title="wikilink">National Security Act of 1947</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Shortly after, in 1952, the Douglas-Manfield Bill afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the <a href="Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" title="wikilink">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> on matters relating to the Marines, and established the structure of three divisions and air wings that remains today.

To execute a flanking maneuver, General <a href="Douglas_McArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas McArthur</a> called on Marine air and ground forces to make an amphibious landing at <a href="Battle_of_Inchon" title="wikilink">Inchon</a>.

However, unlike the <a href="U.S._Eighth_Army" title="wikilink">Eighth Army</a>, which retreated in disarray, the <a href="1st_Marine_Division" title="wikilink">1st Marine Division</a> regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during their fighting withdrawal to the coast.

The Marines operated in the northern I Corps regions of <a href="South_Vietnam" title="wikilink">South Vietnam</a> and fought both a constant guerilla war against the <a href="Vietnam_National_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">NLF</a> and an off and on conventional war against <a href="People&#39;s_Army_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">NVA</a> regulars.

<p>Returning from Vietnam, the Marine Corps hit one of the lowest points in its history with high rates of courts-martial, non-judicial punishments, unauthorized absences, and outright desertions. The re-making of the Marine Corps began in the late 1970s when policies for discharging inadequate Marines were relaxed, leading to the removal of the worst performing ones. Once the quality of new recruits started to improve, the Marine Corps began reforming its NCO corps, a vital element in the functioning of the Marine Corps.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>After Vietnam, the Marines resumed their expeditionary role, participating in <a href="Operation_Urgent_Fury" title="wikilink">Operation Urgent Fury</a> and <a href="Operation_Just_Cause" title="wikilink">Operation Just Cause</a>.

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p>The <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Department of the Navy</a>, lead by the <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Navy</a> (SECNAV), administers both the Marine Corps and the Navy. The most senior Marine officer is the <a href="Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Marine Corps so that it is ready for operation under the command of the <a href="Military_of_the_United_States#Unified_Combatant_Commands" title="wikilink">Unified Combatant Commanders</a>. The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: <a href="Headquarters_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Headquarters Marine Corps</a>, the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the <a href="Marine_Forces_Reserve" title="wikilink">Marine Forces Reserve</a>.</p>
<p>The Operating Forces are further subdivided into three categories: Marine Corps Forces (MARFOR) assigned to unified commands, Marine Corps Security Forces guarding naval installations, and <a href="Marine_Corps_Security_Guard" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Security Guard</a> detachments at American embassies. Under the &quot;Forces for Unified Commands&quot; memo, Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the regional unified commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense and with the approval of the President. Since 1991, the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Marine Corps Forces are further divided into Marine Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC), each headed by a <a href="Lieutenant_General" title="wikilink">Lieutenant General</a>.

<h3 id="relationship-with-other-services">Relationship with other services</h3>
<p>Since the Marine Corps' combat capabilities overlap those of the <a href="U.S._Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a>, the latter has historically viewed the Corps as encroaching on the Army's capabilities and competing for money, missions, and fame. The attitude dates back to the founding of the <a href="Colonial_Marines" title="wikilink">Colonial Marines</a>, when General <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> refused to allow the initial Marine battalions to be drawn from among his army. Most significantly, in the aftermath of <a href="WWII" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWII</a>, Army efforts to restructure the American defense establishment included the dissolution of the Marine Corps and the folding of its capabilities into the other services. Leading this movement were such prominent Army officers as General <a href="Dwight_Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight Eisenhower</a> and <a href="Army_Chief_of_Staff" title="wikilink">Army Chief of Staff</a> <a href="George_C._Marshall" title="wikilink">George C. Marshall</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>The Marine Corps is a partner service with the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> under the <a href="Department_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Department of the Navy</a>. Both the <a href="Chief_of_Naval_Operations" title="wikilink">Chief of Naval Operations</a> (CNO) and <a href="Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, heads of their respective services, report directly to the <a href="Secretary_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Navy</a> (SECNAV), a civilian who heads the Department of the Navy. As a result, the Navy and Marine Corps have a close relationship, more so than with other branches of the <a href="United_States_Military" title="wikilink">United States Military</a>. Whitepapers and promotional literature of the 20th century have commonly used the phrase &quot;Navy-Marine Corps Team&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This relationship stems from the Navy providing transport, logistical, and combat support to put Marine units into the fight. Conversely, the Marine Corps is responsible for conducting land operations to support Naval campaigns, including the seizure of naval and air bases.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps cooperates with the Navy on many institutional support services. The Corps receives a significant portion of its officers from the <a href="United_States_Naval_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Naval Academy</a> and <a href="Naval_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC)</a>, which are partially staffed by Marines. Marine Corps Drill Instructors contribute to training Naval officers in Officer Candidate School. Marine aviators are trained in the Naval Aviation training pipeline, and utilize Naval weapons and test pilot schools. Navy <a href="aircraft_carriers" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a> deploy with a Marine <a href="F/A-18_Hornet" title="wikilink">Hornet</a> squadron alongside Navy squadrons. The <a href="Blue_Angels" title="wikilink">Navy's Blue Angels</a> flight demonstration team includes at least one Marine pilot and is supported by a Marines <a href="C-130" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-130</a> Hercules aircraft.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the Marines do not train <a href="chaplains" class="uri" title="wikilink">chaplains</a> or medical personnel, officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fill these roles. Some of these sailors, particularly <a href="Hospital_Corpsmen" title="wikilink">Hospital Corpsmen</a>, generally wear Marine uniforms emblazoned with Navy insignia and markings in order to be noticeably distinct to compatriots but indistinguishable to enemies. The Marines also operate a network security team in conjunction with the Navy. Marine Corps <a href="Medal_of_Honor" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a> recipients wear the Navy variant of the award. Marines also may be awarded the <a href="Navy_Cross" title="wikilink">Navy Cross</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="air-ground-task-forces">Air-ground task forces</h3>

<p>Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the <a href="Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force" title="wikilink">Marine Air-Ground Task Force</a> (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size. A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), a air combat element (ACE), and and a combat service support element (CSSE) under a common command element (CE). A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a larger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission and dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to <a href="combined_arms" title="wikilink">combined arms</a>, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness towards overreliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a <a href="marine_expeditionary_unit" title="wikilink">Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU)</a>, based around a reinforced infantry <a href="battalion" class="uri" title="wikilink">battalion</a> and a composite <a href="squadron" class="uri" title="wikilink">squadron</a>, up to the largest, a <a href="Marine_Expeditionary_Force" title="wikilink">Marine Expeditionary Force</a> (MEF), which ties together a <a href="Division_(military)" title="wikilink">Division</a>, an <a href="Wing_(air_force_unit)" title="wikilink">Air Wing</a>, and a <a href="Marine_Logistics_Group" title="wikilink">Logistics Group</a> under a MEF Headquarters Group. There are usually three MEUs assigned to each of the U.S. Navy <a href="U.S._Atlantic_Fleet" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> and <a href="U.S._Pacific_Fleet" title="wikilink">Pacific Fleets</a>, with a seventh MEU based on <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>. While one MEU is on deployment, one MEU is training to deploy and one is standing down, resting its Marines, and refitting. Each MEU is rated as capable of performing special operations.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The three Marine Expeditionary Forces are:</p>

Then Commandant <a href="Paul_X._Kelley" title="wikilink">Paul X.

<h3 id="rank-structure">Rank structure</h3>
<p>As in the rest of the U.S. military, <a href="Military_rank" title="wikilink">ranks</a> fall into one of three categories: <a href="commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">commissioned officer</a>, <a href="warrant_officer" title="wikilink">warrant officer</a>, and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority. To standardize compensation, each rank is assigned a <a href="pay_grade" title="wikilink">pay grade</a>. The following tables list the rank, abbreviation, paygrade, and insignia of each rank.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="commissioned-officers">Commissioned Officers</h4>

<p>Commissioned Officers are distinguished from other officers by their <em>commission</em>, which is the formal written authority, issued in the name of the <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a>, that confers the rank and authority of a Marine Officer. Commissioned officers carry the &quot;special trust and confidence&quot; of the President of the United States. Commissioned officer ranks are further subdivided into <strong>Generals</strong>, <strong>field-grade officers</strong>, and <strong>company-grade officers</strong>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="warrant-officers">Warrant Officers</h4>
<p><a href="Warrant_Officer" title="wikilink">Warrant Officers</a> provide leadership and skills in specialized fields. Unlike most other militaries, the American military confers commissions on its Warrant Officers, though they are generally not responsible for leadership outside of their specialty. Warrant officers come primarily from the senior Non-Commissioned Officer ranks.</p>
<p>A Chief Warrant Officer, CWO2-CWO5, serving in the MOS 0306 &quot;Infantry Weapons Officer&quot; carries a special title, &quot;Marine Gunner&quot; (not a rank). A Marine Gunner replaces the Chief Warrant Officer insignia on the left collar with a bursting bomb insignia. Other warrant officers are sometimes informally also referred to as &quot;Gunner&quot; but this usage is not correct.</p>

<h4 id="enlisted">Enlisted</h4>

<p>Enlisted Marines with paygrades of E-4 and E-5 are considered <a href="non-commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">non-commissioned officers</a> (NCOs) while those at E-6 and higher are considered Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs). The E-8 and E-9 levels each have two ranks per pay grade, each with different responsibilities. Gunnery Sergeants (E-7) indicate on their annual evaluations, called &quot;fitness reports&quot;, or &quot;fitreps&quot; for short, their preferred promotional track: Master Sergeant or First Sergeant. The First Sergeant and Sergeant Major ranks are command-oriented, with Marines of these ranks serving as the senior enlisted Marines in a unit, charged to assist the commanding officer in matter of discipline, administration and the morale and welfare of the unit. Master Sergeants and Master Gunnery Sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists in their specific MOS. First Sergeants typically serve as the senior enlisted Marine in a company, battery or other unit at similar echelon, while Sergeants Major serve the same role in battalions, squadrons or larger units. The <a href="Sergeant_Major_of_the_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps</a> is a rank conferred on the senior enlisted Marine of the entire Marine Corps, personally selected by the <a href="Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>.</p>
<h4 id="forms-of-address">Forms of address</h4>
<p>Marines address all enlisted personnel by rank, and all Commissioned officers with &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma'am&quot;. Warrant Officers, regardless of rank, are addressed as &quot;Warrant Officer&quot; or &quot;Gunner&quot;, although this latter usage is improper unless the Warrant Officer holds the Military Occupational Specialty of Infantry Weapons Officer (MOS 0306). However, during recruit training, recruits are indoctrinated to address all officers as &quot;sir&quot; and superior enlisted ranks by their rank and last name. Unlike the Army, ranks containing &quot;Sergeant&quot; are always addressed by their full rank and never shortened to simply &quot;Sergeant&quot;</p>
<p>Informally, some enlisted ranks have commonly used nicknames, though they are not official and technically improper. For instance, a Master Sergeant is commonly called &quot;Top,&quot; and a Master Gunnery Sergeant is &quot;Master Guns&quot; or &quot;Master Gunny.&quot; A First Sergeant is always referred to by his/her proper rank. A Gunnery Sergeant is typically called &quot;Gunny,&quot; and (much less often) &quot;Guns.&quot; Likewise, Lance Corporals are often referred to (derisively) as &quot;Lance Coolies&quot;, &quot;Lance Coconuts&quot;, &quot;Lance Criminals&quot; or some other derivative. They are not usually called by rank due to their status as &quot;non-NCOs&quot;, or &quot;non-rates.&quot; The rank of Sergeant is never referred to as &quot;Sarge.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="officers">Officers</h4>
<p>Every year, approximately 1600 new Marine officers are commissioned, and 38,000 recruits accepted and trained.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Commissioned officers are commissioned mainly through one of three sources: <a href="ROTC" title="wikilink">Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps</a> (NROTC), <a href="Officer_Candidate_School" title="wikilink">Officer Candidate School</a> (OCS) – including the <a href="Platoon_Leaders_Class" title="wikilink">Platoon Leaders Class</a> (PLC) and <a href="Officer_Candidates_Class" title="wikilink">Officer Candidates Class</a>(OCC) – or the <a href="United_States_Naval_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Naval Academy</a> (USNA).</p>
<p>Following commissioning, all Marine commissioned officers, regardless of accession route or further training requirements, attend <a href="The_Basic_School" title="wikilink">The Basic School</a> at <a href="Marine_Corps_Base_Quantico" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Base Quantico</a>, Virginia. There, they spend six months learning to command a rifle platoon. The Basic School, for second lieutenants and warrant officers learning the art of infantry and combined arms warfare, is an example of the Corps' approach to furthering the concept that <em>&quot;Every Marine is a rifleman.&quot;</em><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="enlisted-1">Enlisted</h4>
<p>Enlisted Marines attend <a href="recruit_training" title="wikilink">boot camp</a>, at either <a href="Marine_Corps_Recruit_Depot_San_Diego" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) San Diego</a> or <a href="MCRD_Parris_Island" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island</a>, just outside Beaufort, South Carolina. Women only attend the Parris Island depot, in the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion, while males who train at Parris Island comprise the First through Third Battalions. The Mississippi River serves as the dividing line which delineates who will be trained where (with some minor exceptions), based on what recruiting district the enlistee was recruited from. Marine recruit training is the longest among the American services;it is 13 weeks long, as compared to the Army's 8 to 9 weeks.</p>
<p>Enlisted Marines then attend <a href="U.S._Marine_Corps_School_of_Infantry" title="wikilink">School of Infantry</a> training at <a href="Camp_Geiger" title="wikilink">Camp Geiger</a> or <a href="Camp_Pendleton" title="wikilink">Camp Pendleton</a>, generally based upon where the Marine received their recruit training. Infantry Marines begin their <a href="Military_Occupational_Specialty" title="wikilink">Military Occupational Specialty</a> (MOS) training immediately with the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), while all other Marines train with the Marine Combat Training (MCT) Battalion for 22 days, learning common infantry skills, before continuing on to their MOS schools.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="uniforms">Uniforms</h2>

<p><img src="PlateIV_Enlisted_Dress_Uniform.jpg" title="fig:Enlisted Blue Dress Uniform" alt="Enlisted Blue Dress Uniform" width="200" /> <img src="PlateI_Officer_Service_Uniform.jpg" title="fig:Officer Service Uniform" alt="Officer Service Uniform" width="200" /> <img src="Hagee_in_MARPAT_with_Soldier.jpg" title="fig:Gen. Hagee and an enlisted Marine in woodland MARPAT" alt="Gen. Hagee and an enlisted Marine in woodland MARPAT" width="200" /> Uniforms serve to distinguish Marines from members of other services and militaries. The Marine Corps has the most stable and hence most recognizable uniforms in the American military; the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th century<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and the service uniform to the early 20th century. The Marines have three main uniforms: Dress, Service, and Utility.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps <strong><a href="Dress_uniform" title="wikilink">Dress uniform</a></strong> is the most elaborate, worn for formal or ceremonial occasions. There are three different forms of the Dress uniform. The most common is the <strong>Blue Dress Uniform</strong>. There is also a &quot;Blue-White&quot; Dress for summer, and Evening Dress for formal (white tie) occasions.</p>
<p>The Blue Dress uniform, often seen in recruiting advertisements, is also often called <strong>&quot;Dress Blues&quot;</strong> or simply <strong>&quot;Blues&quot;</strong>. It is equivalent in composition and use to <a href="black_tie" title="wikilink">black tie</a>, worn at ceremonial events. It consists of a long-sleeved midnight blue coat with a standing collar, white barracks cover, plain white shirt, sky blue trousers with white web belt or suspenders, white gloves, and black shoes and socks. The uniform may also be worn with a khaki long- or short-sleeved shirt in place of the coat. The <a href="Mameluke_Sword" title="wikilink">Mameluke Sword</a> (for officers) or NCO's sword may be worn as prescribed. NCO's, SNCO's, and Officers wear a blood stripe on their trousers.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Service Uniform</strong> is the typical uniform for day to day wear in an office setting and is the most commonly worn. Consisting of olive green and khaki colors, it is commonly referred to as <strong>&quot;Greens&quot;</strong>. It is roughly equivalent in function and composition to a <a href="business_suit" title="wikilink">business suit</a>. It consists of a green coat, green trousers with khaki web belt, khaki longsleeve shirt, khaki tie, tie clasp, and black shoes. Females wear a green necktab in place of the tie, pumps instead of shoes, and have the option of wearing a skirt instead of slacks. Marines may wear a soft garrison cap (sometimes nicknamed &quot;piss cutter&quot;), or a hard framed hat, which differs in design between females and males.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Utility Uniform</strong> is intended for wear in the field or for working parties, and consists of camouflage blouse and trousers, tan suede boots, and green undershirt. It is rendered in <a href="MARPAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">MARPAT</a> digital camouflage that breaks up the wearer's shape, and also serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services. There are two approved varieties of MARPAT, woodland (green/brown/black) and desert (tan/brown/grey). In garrison, during the summer months, the sleeves of the blouse are tightly folded up to the biceps, exposing the lighter inside layer, and forming a neat cuff to present a crisper appearance to the otherwise formless uniform. In Haiti, the practice earned them the nickname &quot;whitesleeves&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The approved headwear for this uniform is the utility cover, an eight-pointed brimmed hat that is worn &quot;blocked&quot;, that is, creased and peaked. In the field, a boonie cover is also authorized. Since the introduction of the <a href="Marine_Corps_Martial_Arts_Program" title="wikilink">Marine Corps Martial Arts Program</a>(MCMAP), Marines have the option of substituting a color-coded rigger's belt for their web belt, indicating their level of proficiency in MCMAP. Unlike the Dress and Service uniforms, utilities are not permitted for off-duty wear. Though exceptions are made for essential commuting tasks, e.g. picking up children from daycare or purchasing gas, the wear of utilities in public is otherwise prohibited.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>As in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others. The Corps' embracement of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high <em>esprit de corps</em>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="official-traditions-and-customs">Official traditions and customs</h3>
<p>The Marine motto <strong>&quot;<a href="Semper_Fidelis" title="wikilink">Semper Fidelis</a>&quot;</strong> means &quot;Always faithful&quot; in Latin. This motto often appears in the shortened form &quot;Semper Fi&quot;. It is also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by <a href="John_Phillip_Sousa" title="wikilink">John Phillip Sousa</a>. It was adopted in 1883, before which, the traditional mottos were <em>&quot;Fortitudine&quot;</em> (With Fortitude); <em>By Sea and by Land</em>, a translation of the <a href="Royal_Marines" title="wikilink">Royal Marines</a>' <em>Per Mare, Per Terram</em>; and <em>To the Shores of Tripoli</em>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Flags_USMC.gif" title="fig:A rendition of the emblem on the flag of the U.S. Marine Corps" alt="A rendition of the emblem on the flag of the U.S. Marine Corps" width="250" /> The <strong>Marine Corps emblem</strong> is the Eagle, Globe and Anchor, often shortented to the &quot;Globe and Anchor&quot;, or EGA. Adopted in its present form in 1868, it derives partially from ornaments worn by the Continental Marines and the <a href="Royal_Marines" title="wikilink">British Royal Marines</a>, and is usually topped with a ribbon reading &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;. The eagle stands for a proud country, the globe signifies global service, and the fouled anchor signifies maritime traditions. The eagle is a crested eagle found worldwide, not the <a href="bald_eagle" title="wikilink">bald eagle</a> that appears in other American symbols and is native to North America. The eagle is standing on the western hemisphere and is a holding a scroll with the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, on it. It is inscribed with gold letters, &lt;U+201C&gt;Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Marine Corps seal</strong> was designated by General <a href="Lemuel_C._Shepherd" title="wikilink">Lemuel C. Shepherd</a>, Jr., and consists of the Marine emblem in bronze, the beak holding a ribbon reading &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;, on a scarlet and blue background with gold trim. On the seal, however, a bald eagle appears in place of the crested eagle<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a>. The blue signifies naval ties, the scarlet and gold are the official <strong>Marine Corps colors</strong>. They appear ubiquitously in the Marine Corps, particularly on signage. They also form the base colors of the <a href="flag_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">flag of the United States Marine Corps</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Two styles of <strong>swords</strong> are worn by Marines. The Marine Corps officers' sword is a <a href="Mameluke_sword" title="wikilink">Mameluke sword</a>, similar to the Persian <a href="shamshir" class="uri" title="wikilink">shamshir</a> presented to Lt. <a href="Presley_O&#39;Bannon" title="wikilink">Presley O'Bannon</a> after the <a href="Battle_of_Derna" title="wikilink">Battle of Derna</a> during the <a href="First_Barbary_War" title="wikilink">First Barbary War</a>. After its adoption in 1825 and initial distribution in 1826, Mameluke swords have been worn by Marine officers ever since, except during the period 1859-1875, when they were required to wear the Army's Model 1850 foot officers' sword. Since 1859, Noncommissioned officers have worn a different style of sword, similar to the U.S. Army's foot officers' sword of the Civil War, making Marine NCOs along with U.S. Cavalry NCOs the only enlisted service members in the U.S. Armed Forces authorized to carry a sword.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Marine Corps Birthday</strong> is celebrated every year on the 10th of November. The celebrations were formalized by Commandant <a href="Lemuel_C._Shepherd" title="wikilink">Lemuel C. Shepherd</a> in 1952, outlining the cake ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, and the second to the youngest Marine present. The celebration also includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, Commandant <a href="John_A._Lejeune" title="wikilink">Lejeune</a>'s Birthday Message.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="unofficial-traditions-and-customs">Unofficial traditions and customs</h3>
<p><img src="Teufelhunden.gif" title="fig:A recruiting poster makes use of the &quot;Teufelhunden&quot; nickname" alt="A recruiting poster makes use of the &quot;Teufelhunden&quot; nickname" /> Marines have several generic <a href="nickname" title="wikilink">nicknames</a>, mildly derogatory when used by outsiders but complimentary when used by Marines themselves. They include &quot;jarhead&quot; (it was said their hats on their uniform made them look like mason jars, or that the regulation &quot;high and tight&quot; haircut gave the appearance of a jar-lid), &quot;gyrene&quot; (perhaps a combination of &quot;<a href="G.I." class="uri" title="wikilink">G.I.</a>&quot; and &quot;Marine&quot;), &quot;leatherneck&quot;, referring to the leather collar that was a part of the Marine uniform during the Revolutionary War period, and &quot;Devil Dog&quot; (&quot;Teufelhunden&quot;, a corruption of the German <em>Teufelshund</em>, on posters and in print) after the <a href="Battle_of_Belleau_Wood" title="wikilink">Battle of Belleau Wood</a>. The bulldog has been closely associated with the Marine Corps.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>A spirited cry, <strong>&quot;<a href="Oorah" title="wikilink">Ooh-rah</a>!&quot;</strong>, is common among Marines, being similar in function and purpose to the Army's &quot;Hooah&quot; cry. &quot;Ooh-rah!&quot; is usually either a reply in the affirmative to a question, an acknowledgment of an order, an expression of enthusiasm (real or false), or a greeting. Usage of the term appears to have begun sometime after the second World War and became more firmly established after the Korean War. There is little agreement or authoritative documentation on where, or why, the practice originated. Apocryphal <a href="Oorah" title="wikilink">stories</a> have arisen regarding the origin of the term, including imitations of <a href="submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarine</a> alarm klaxons, <a href="civil_defense_sirens" title="wikilink">air raid sirens</a> and modifications by English speakers of the word &quot;kill&quot; in languages such as <a href="Turkish_language" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> and <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a>. Another theory, (commonly held although there is no firm data pointing toward it), is that &quot;Oorah!&quot; is based off the British cheer &quot;Hurrah!&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> &quot;Semper Fi, Mac&quot;, was the common and preferred form of greeting in times past. This term is more than a &quot;spirited cry&quot; or a guttural sound. It was a proclamation of the Marine Corps Motto and a welcome greeting to the ears of those being greeted. It fostered a tie among the brethren who fought in the bloody fields of the Pacific Island hopping campaign and all around the world.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="former-marines">Former Marines</h3>
<p>Marines and those familiar with Marine Corps tradition will often object to the use of the term &quot;ex-Marine&quot; because Marines are inculcated with the <a href="ethos" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethos</a> <em>&quot;Once a Marine, always a Marine.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Former Marine</em> refers to an individual that completed their service and has received an <a href="Honorable_Discharge" title="wikilink">honorable</a> or <a href="Military_discharge" title="wikilink">general</a> discharge from the service. Marines who have retired are commonly called &quot;retired Marines&quot;, &quot;Sir/Ma'am&quot; out of respect, &quot;Marine&quot;, which they still are, or according to the &quot;Commandant's White letters&quot; from Commandant <a href="Alfred_M._Gray,_Jr." title="wikilink">General Gray</a> until present, by their earned rank.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="martial-arts-program">Martial arts program</h3>

<p>In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated an internally designed martial arts program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, or MCMAP for short. The idea was borrowed from the South Korean Marines, who train in martial arts and who, during the Vietnam War, were widely rumored to all hold black belts. Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the &quot;Warrior Ethos&quot; within Marines.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts. MCMAP consists of boxing movements, joint locking techniques, opponent weight transfer (<a href="Jujutsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jujutsu</a>), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, noncompliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes.</p>
<p>Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp. There are 5 levels of MCMAP, signified by the color of a riggers belt. The colors from the lowest to the highest levels; Tan, Grey, Green, Brown, and Black. A minimum level of achievement is set for each rank level, including officers. Recruits and junior officers must earn a tan belt in initial training before being allowed to graduate. After entering the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF), Marines are allowed to progress further in MCMAP. Tan and Grey belts are considered the foundation of the movements in MCMAP, with succeeding belts building on those basic techniques. When a Marine reaches the level of Green belt, he has the opportunity to become an instructor or instructor trainer. This is represented by a tan stripe to the left of the buckle. At the brown belt level, a Marine must be at a minimum an instructor in MCMAP. The highest level in belts is the black belt which has 6 degrees indicated by red stripes to the right of the buckle.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Usmc_kabul_DMR_sighting.jpg" title="fig:Marine sniper using the M14 designated marksman rifle" alt="Marine sniper using the M14 designated marksman rifle" width="250" /> The basic infantry weapon of the Marine Corps is the <a href="M16_rifle" title="wikilink">M16 assault rifle</a>. Suppression fire is provided by the <a href="M249" title="wikilink">M249 SAW</a> and <a href="M240" title="wikilink">M240G</a> machine guns at the fireteam, and company levels, respectively. In addition, indirect fire is provided by the <a href="M203_grenade_launcher" title="wikilink">M203 grenade launcher</a> in fireteams, <a href="M224_Mortar" title="wikilink">M224 60 mm mortar</a> in companies, and <a href="M252_Mortar" title="wikilink">M252 81 mm mortar</a> in battalions. The <a href="M2_machine_gun" title="wikilink">M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun</a> and <a href="MK-19_(weapon)" title="wikilink">MK19 Automatic Grenade Launcher (40 mm)</a> are available for use by dismounted infantry, though they are more commonly vehicle-mounted. Precision fires are provided by the <a href="U.S._Marine_Corps_Designated_Marksman_Rifle" title="wikilink">M14 designated marksman rifle</a> and <a href="M40" title="wikilink">M40A3 Sniper Rifle</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The Marine Corps utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an offensive and defensive anti-armor capability. The <a href="Shoulder-Launched_Multipurpose_Assault_Weapon" title="wikilink">SMAW</a> and <a href="M136_AT4" title="wikilink">AT4 Anti-Tank Missile</a> are unguided rockets that can destroy armor and fixed defenses (e.g. bunkers) at ranges up to 500 meters. The <a href="Predator_Light_Anti-Armour_Missile" title="wikilink">Predator SRAW</a>, <a href="FGM-148_Javelin" title="wikilink">FGM-148 <em>Javelin</em></a>, <a href="BGM-71_TOW" title="wikilink">BGM-71 TOW</a> are guided anti-tank missiles. All three can utilize top-attack profiles to avoid heavy frontal armor. The Predator is a short-range <a href="fire-and-forget" class="uri" title="wikilink">fire-and-forget</a> weapon; the Javelin and TOW are heavier missiles effective past 2000 meters that give infantry an offensive capability against armor.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

However, for its specific needs, the Corps has a number of unique vehicles. The <a href="LAV_25" title="wikilink">LAV 25</a> is a dedicated wheeled armored personnel carrier used to provide strategic mobility.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Amphibious capability is provided by the <a href="Amphibious_Assault_Vehicle" title="wikilink">AAV-7A1 Amphibious Assault Vehicle</a>, an armored tractor that doubles as an armored personnel carrier. Somewhat dated, it will shortly replaced by the <a href="Expeditionary_Fighting_Vehicle" title="wikilink">Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle</a>, a markedly faster tractor that incorporates superior armor and weaponry.</p>
<p>Prior to 2005, the Marines operated exclusively tube artillery – the <a href="M198" title="wikilink">M198 155 mm howitzer</a>, now being replaced by the <a href="M777" title="wikilink">M777 155 mm howitzer</a>. In 2005, the Corps expanded its artillery composition to include the <a href="High_Mobility_Artillery_rocket_system" title="wikilink">High Mobility Artillery rocket system (HIMARS)</a>, a truck-mounted rocket artillery system.
