<p><strong>William Simpson &quot;Bill&quot; McAloney</strong> <a href="George_Cross" title="wikilink">GC</a>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> (12 May 1910 &lt;U+2013&gt; 31 August 1995) was a senior engineering officer in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and an <a href="List_of_Australian_George_Cross_recipients" title="wikilink">Australian exchange recipient</a> of the <a href="George_Cross" title="wikilink">George Cross</a>, the highest <a href="Civil_awards_and_decorations" title="wikilink">civil decoration</a> for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a>. Born in <a href="Adelaide" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a>, he worked as a <a href="Auto_mechanic" title="wikilink">mechanic</a> before enlisting in the RAAF as an aircraft engine <a href="Machinist" title="wikilink">fitter</a> in 1936. In August the following year, he attempted to rescue the pilot of a crashed <a href="Hawker_Hart#Demon" title="wikilink">Hawker Demon</a> aircraft engulfed in flames at an airfield in <a href="Hamilton,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Hamilton, Victoria</a>. The first on scene, McAloney rushed into the wreckage in an effort to extract the unconscious pilot. The pilot's leg was trapped, however, and while struggling to free it one of the wing tanks burst, knocking McAloney unconscious. McAloney was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns and spent the next month in hospital. He was subsequently awarded the <a href="Albert_Medal_(lifesaving)" title="wikilink">Albert Medal</a> for his actions in the rescue attempt.</p>
<p>McAloney sufficiently recovered to return to his work in the RAAF, and during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> was primarily involved in engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia. <a href="Officer_(armed_forces)" title="wikilink">Commissioned</a> as a <a href="flying_officer" title="wikilink">flying officer</a> in 1942, he saw service in <a href="Netherlands_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">Dutch New Guinea</a> during late 1944. He received a permanent commission in the RAAF in 1948, and was advanced to <a href="squadron_leader" title="wikilink">squadron leader</a> in 1950. During the <a href="Malayan_Emergency" title="wikilink">Malayan Emergency</a>, he served as technical officer to both <a href="No._90_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 90 Wing</a> and <a href="No._1_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 1 Squadron</a>, based in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>. In 1960, he was made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the <a href="Aircraft_Research_and_Development_Unit" title="wikilink">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a>, and was appointed an <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his efforts in the post. McAloney retired in 1966 with the honorary rank of <a href="group_captain" title="wikilink">group captain</a>. In 1971, the Albert Medal was discontinued and living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; McAloney took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the latter. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>McAloney was born on 12 May 1910 in <a href="Adelaide" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South_Australia" title="wikilink">South Australia</a>, the eldest son of William Samuel McAloney and his wife Mary (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Murphy).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The young McAloney was educated at <a href="Thebarton_Senior_College" title="wikilink">Thebarton Technical High School</a> and the Adelaide School of Mines.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1925, McAloney registered for <a href="Conscription_in_Australia" title="wikilink">compulsory military training</a> in the <a href="Australian_Army_Reserve" title="wikilink">Citizen Military Force</a>, serving as a <a href="Private_(rank)" title="wikilink">private</a> with the 43rd Battalion until November 1929. During this time, he gained employment as an <a href="Auto_mechanic" title="wikilink">automotive mechanic</a> with Vrai Ltd, where he received on-the-job training in place of a formal apprenticeship. McAloney was employed with Vrai for three years, before he took a position with Adelaide Car Service.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1931, McAloney purchased a garage and engineering workshop in <a href="Wirrulla,_South_Australia" title="wikilink">Wirrulla</a>. He operated the establishment for the next five years, the business conducting work on various types of vehicle including cars, trucks and tractors.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the business ultimately experienced financial difficulties and was forced to close.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In a ceremony on 24 June 1935, McAloney wed Dora Winifred Johnson; the couple later had four daughters and three sons.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In light of his business closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> on 1 July 1936.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ranked <a href="aircraftman" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraftman</a>, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero <a href="Machinist" title="wikilink">fitter and turner</a> before being attached to <a href="No._1_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 1 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF_Williams" title="wikilink">RAAF Base Laverton</a>, Victoria, in September.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was employed in a maintenance role within the unit, working on the <a href="Bristol_Jupiter" title="wikilink">Jupiter Gipsy</a> and <a href="Rolls-Royce_Kestrel" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce Kestrel</a> engines of <a href="Bristol_Bulldog" title="wikilink">Bristol Bulldog</a> and <a href="Hawker_Hart#Demon" title="wikilink">Hawker Demon</a> aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time <a href="air_gunner" title="wikilink">air gunner</a> course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon aircraft of No. 1 Squadron were on a training flight, during which they landed at an air base in <a href="Hamilton,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Hamilton, Victoria</a>. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, <a href="Pilot_Officer" title="wikilink">Pilot Officer</a> Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> McAloney&lt;U+2014&gt;who was a passenger in the third aircraft&lt;U+2014&gt;witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage in an effort to extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 1941, McAloney was posted to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In this capacity he advised on the procurement of equipment and spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> to check equipment stores.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> On 1 March 1942, he was <a href="Officer_(armed_forces)" title="wikilink">commissioned</a> as a <a href="flying_officer" title="wikilink">flying officer</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs and served as a liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Promoted to temporary <a href="flight_lieutenant" title="wikilink">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 August 1943, McAloney was sent to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and <a href="gas_turbine" title="wikilink">gas turbine</a> jet engines.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The following November, he was dispatched to <a href="Netherlands_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">Dutch New Guinea</a> to rectify issues being experienced with <a href="Pratt_&amp;_Whitney" title="wikilink">Pratt &amp; Whitney</a> engines in operations by aircraft of the <a href="Australian_First_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">1st Tactical Air Force</a>.

<p>In mid-1946, McAloney was involved in an investigation into a series of engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and transport units throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Made <a href="squadron_leader" title="wikilink">squadron leader</a> in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> McAloney was posted to <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a> in June 1952 as the technical officer to the <a href="Changi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Changi</a>-based <a href="No._90_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a>, formed specifically for service in the <a href="Malayan_Emergency" title="wikilink">Malayan Emergency</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No. 90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No. 1 Squadron, then operating out of <a href="Tengah,_Singapore" title="wikilink">Tengah</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
