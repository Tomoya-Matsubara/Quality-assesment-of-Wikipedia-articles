<p>McBride played <a href="Varsity_team" title="wikilink">varsity</a> soccer at <a href="Buffalo_Grove_High_School" title="wikilink">Buffalo Grove High School</a>, under coach John Erfort, where he led the Bison to the Illinois state championship in 1988, his junior year. In his four years in high school, he scored 80 goals, 33 as a senior.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> McBride was also named an All-American by Parade Magazine.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Later, as a professional, he signed a contract with <a href="Nike,_Inc." title="wikilink">Nike</a> with the condition that the boys' varsity soccer team receive new uniforms every two years.</p>
<p>McBride had an illustrious career with <a href="Saint_Louis_University" title="wikilink">Saint Louis University</a>, from which he graduated in 1993. In his four seasons with the Billikens, he played (and started) in 89 games, and set career records for goals (72), assists (40) and total points (184).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While at school, McBride was a 1992 second team and a 1993 <a href="Division_I_First-Team_All-American_(soccer)" title="wikilink">first team All American</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He also was named <a href="MVP" class="uri" title="wikilink">MVP</a> of the <a href="Great_Midwest_Conference" title="wikilink">Great Midwest Conference</a> three years straight, as well as being named to the All-Conference first-team during this stretch.

<h3 id="club">Club</h3>
<h4 id="milwaukee-rampage">Milwaukee Rampage</h4>
<p>McBride briefly played for the minor league <a href="Milwaukee_Rampage" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Rampage</a>. In 18 games, he scored 17 goals and assisted another 18. That year also saw <a href="Tony_Sanneh" title="wikilink">Tony Sanneh</a> playing with the Rampage. Both Sanneh and McBride would play professionally in Germany, in MLS and on the <a href="U.S._national_football_team" title="wikilink">U.S. men's national team</a>.</p>
<p>They linked up for a historic goal at the <a href="2002_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>. In the game against <a href="Portugal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, Sanneh, playing right back, played a cross into the box which McBride put into the top corner. After the game, McBride mentioned, &quot;We joked about it in the locker room, it is a play we have done a thousand times (at the Milwaukee Rampage). &quot;I took a step in at the far post and lost my marker. He delivered a beautiful cross and I knocked it home.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="germany">Germany</h4>
<p>In 1994, McBride left the United States to ply his trade in Germany. At the time, <a href="VfL_Wolfsburg" title="wikilink">VfL Wolfsburg</a> played in the <a href="2._Fu&lt;U+00DF&gt;ball-Bundesliga" title="wikilink">German Second Division</a> and provided several aspiring American players an opportunity to play football in Europe. These included <a href="Chad_Deering" title="wikilink">Chad Deering</a>, <a href="Claudio_Reyna" title="wikilink">Claudio Reyna</a> and <a href="Mike_Lapper" title="wikilink">Mike Lapper</a>, as well as McBride. McBride struggled to find playing time with the club and also had difficulty scoring. However, one of his two goals came in an 2-1 upset victory over <a href="Bayern_Munich" title="wikilink">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="German_Cup" title="wikilink">German Cup</a> quarterfinals. At the end of the season, McBride gained a release from Wolfsburg and when MLS was created, chose to return to play in the United States.</p>
<h4 id="columbus-crew">Columbus Crew</h4>
<p>McBride returned to America in 1996 for the inaugural season of <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a>, for whom he was the first overall pick of the <a href="1996_MLS_Inaugural_Player_Draft" title="wikilink">MLS Inaugural Draft</a>. McBride would proceed to play eight years with the Columbus Crew, amassing 62 goals (tied for the club record with <a href="Jeff_Cunningham" title="wikilink">Jeff Cunningham</a>) and 45 assists in 161 league games, before his move to England. In 2005, he was named to the <a href="MLS_All-Time_Best_XI" title="wikilink">MLS All-Time Best XI</a>.</p>
<h4 id="loan-spells-in-england">Loan spells in England</h4>
<p>While playing for Columbus in the MLS, McBride spent two loan periods in England. The first came in 2000 when McBride played for <a href="Preston_North_End_F.C." title="wikilink">Preston North End</a>, then managed by <a href="David_Moyes" title="wikilink">David Moyes</a>. While McBride played well for the club, he sat out several games after having a blood clot surgically removed from his arm. The clot came as a result of a hard collision McBride had suffered during his first game with Preston. As McBride's loan spell came to an end, Preston attempted to purchase his contract from MLS for $1.8 million. MLS rejected it, considering McBride to be worth twice that amount.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Two years later, <a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a> club <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a> were beginning to slide down the table. David Moyes, now with Everton, remembered McBride's success with Preston and sought the forward's services to help Everton. During McBride's three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4-3 defeat to <a href="Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." title="wikilink">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. He made close friends during the short time with players such as <a href="Leon_Osman" title="wikilink">Leon Osman</a> (with whom he still plays football) and <a href="Richard_Wright_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Richard Wright</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Everton, unlike Preston, merely sought to extend McBride's loan period, but MLS rejected it, preferring a transfer over an extended loan for McBride.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="fulham">Fulham</h4>
<p><img src="Brian_mcbride_ffc_2005.jpg" title="fig:McBride playing for Fulham in 2005" alt="McBride playing for Fulham in 2005" /> In January 2004, <a href="English_Premier_League" title="wikilink">English Premier League</a> club <a href="Fulham_F.C." title="wikilink">Fulham</a> bought McBride's rights from MLS for $1.5 million. He played 18 games during the last half of the 2003-04 season, scoring a total of five goals. His scoring pace remained steady through the next two seasons. In 2004-05, he played 31 league games and 6 cup games, scoring six league and three cup goals. In 2005-06, he played 39 league games and one cup game, scoring 10 league goals and one cup goal. McBride's original contract with Fulham continued only through the 2005-06 season. However, on 10 March 2006, he signed a one year extension which took him through the end of the 2006-07 season. On 2 February 2007, he signed yet another one year extension, taking him through the 2007-2008 season. He has a reputation as a battler with a high work rate, a trait prized in English football.</p>
<p>McBride was Fulham's top scorer for their 2006-07 Premier League campaign with 12 goals to his name. He was given Fulham's captaincy in August 2007.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>When scoring the opening goal in a home match against <a href="Middlesbrough_F.C." title="wikilink">Middlesbrough</a> on 18 August 2007, McBride dislocated his kneecap. He wouldn't make his return to action until a friendly against <a href="Cardiff_City" title="wikilink">Cardiff City</a> in late January 2008, and resumed his Premier League duties as a substitute against <a href="Aston_Villa" title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a> on 3 February 2008.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> McBride scored his first goal since his injury against <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a> at <a href="Craven_Cottage" title="wikilink">Craven Cottage</a> on 16 March 2008, in a 1-0 victory for Fulham.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 May 2008, he announced that he would be leaving Fulham to return to the United States to play in the MLS.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>After scoring 12 goals in 2006-07 season which helped Fulham retain their Premier League status, on 14 May 2007 McBride won the Club's Player of the Year award. He won it again in 2008, and became such a popular figure that the club renamed a bar inside Craven Cottage &quot;McBride's&quot; in June 2009.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="chicago-fire">Chicago Fire</h4>
<p><img src="Mcbridechi.jpg" title="fig:McBride playing for Chicago in 2010" alt="McBride playing for Chicago in 2010" width="140" /> Following the end of his one-year contract extension, McBride decided to return to America to end his career in the MLS. He expressed his desire to play for the Chicago Fire, his hometown.</p>
<p>On 30 July 2008, McBride was traded to the <a href="Chicago_Fire_S.C." title="wikilink">Chicago Fire</a> for <a href="Chad_Barrett" title="wikilink">Chad Barrett</a>, a first round pick in the MLS Super Draft and conditional future considerations. He made his Fire debut on August 16, 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute against <a href="D.C._United" title="wikilink">D.C. United</a>. McBride scored his first goal against Houston Dynamo. McBride scored the first goal in the MLS Playoff Eastern Conference Championship against the Columbus Crew, his former club from the MLS. However, Chicago lost that game 2-1 and were kept from being in the MLS Playoff final.</p>
<h3 id="international">International</h3>
<p>McBride was a significant player for the <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">United States national team</a>, earning 96 <a href="cap_(sport)" title="wikilink">caps</a> and scoring 30 goals for the national team. He made his international debut in 1993.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>He appeared in the <a href="Football_World_Cup_1998" title="wikilink">1998</a>, <a href="Football_World_Cup_2002" title="wikilink">2002</a>, and <a href="Football_World_Cup_2006" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cups</a>, and became the first American ever to score goals in more than one World Cup, doing so in the tournaments of 1998 and 2002; <a href="Clint_Dempsey" title="wikilink">Clint Dempsey</a> and <a href="Landon_Donovan" title="wikilink">Landon Donovan</a> are the only other players to do so. Both of McBride's goals in the 2002 tournament were game-winners for the United States (versus <a href="Portugal_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Portugal</a> and <a href="Mexico_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>). McBride is second behind <a href="Bert_Patenaude" title="wikilink">Bert Patenaude</a> for the most World Cup goals for an American with three.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2006, McBride was named to the US roster for his 3rd consecutive <a href="Football_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cup</a>. At the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006 World Cup</a>, McBride was severely bloodied in the group stage match against Italy. <a href="Daniele_De_Rossi" title="wikilink">Daniele De Rossi</a> elbowed McBride in the face, requiring the American to get three stitches. De Rossi was banned for four matches and fined CHF 10,000.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>McBride announced his retirement from international football on July 26, 2006.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He is the first-ever spokesperson for the Central Ohio Diabetes Association.
