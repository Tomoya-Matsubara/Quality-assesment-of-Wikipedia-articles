<p><strong>Elizabeth II</strong> (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) is the <a href="Constitutional_monarchy" title="wikilink">constitutional monarch</a> of 16 <a href="sovereign_state" title="wikilink">sovereign states</a>, known as the <a href="Commonwealth_realm" title="wikilink">Commonwealth realms</a>, and their territories and dependencies, and head of the 53-member <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Nations</a>.

<p>Upon her accession on 6 February 1952, Elizabeth became <a href="Head_of_the_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Head of the Commonwealth</a> and <a href="queen_regnant" title="wikilink">queen regnant</a> of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Union_of_South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, <a href="Dominion_of_Pakistan" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Dominion_of_Ceylon" title="wikilink">Ceylon</a>. From 1956 to 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. At present, in addition to the first four of the aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of <a href="Jamaica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Barbados" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbados</a>, <a href="the_Bahamas" title="wikilink">the Bahamas</a>, <a href="Grenada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grenada</a>, <a href="Papua_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">Papua New Guinea</a>, the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="Tuvalu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tuvalu</a>, <a href="Saint_Lucia" title="wikilink">Saint Lucia</a>, <a href="Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines" title="wikilink">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a>, <a href="Belize" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belize</a>, <a href="Antigua_and_Barbuda" title="wikilink">Antigua and Barbuda</a>, and <a href="Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis" title="wikilink">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a>. Her reign of  years is currently the <a href="List_of_monarchs_in_Britain_by_length_of_reign#Overall" title="wikilink">second longest for a British monarch</a>; only <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, her great-great grandmother, has reigned longer, at over 63 years.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was born in London and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as <a href="George_VI" title="wikilink">George VI</a> in 1936 on the <a href="Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" title="wikilink">abdication</a> of his brother <a href="Edward_VIII" title="wikilink">Edward VIII</a>, from which time she was the <a href="heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heir presumptive</a>. She began to undertake public duties during the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, in which she served in the <a href="Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" title="wikilink">Auxiliary Territorial Service</a>.

Her <a href="Coronation_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">coronation service</a> took place in 1953 and was the first to be televised.</p>
<p>Elizabeth II's many historic visits and meetings include a <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_II&#39;s_visit_to_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">state visit to the Republic of Ireland</a> and reciprocal visits to and from the <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a>. Elizabeth has seen major constitutional changes in her realms, such as <a href="devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">devolution in the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="patriation" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriation</a> of the Canadian constitution. Times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children and grandchildren, the <a href="investiture_of_the_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">investiture of the Prince of Wales</a>, and the celebration of milestones such as her <a href="Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Silver</a>, <a href="Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Golden</a>, and <a href="Diamond_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Diamond Jubilees</a> in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively.</p>

There have been times of personal sorrow for her which include the death of her father at 56, the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, <a href="Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="wikilink">Lord Mountbatten</a>, the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (a year deemed her <em><a href="Annus_horribilis#Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">annus horribilis</a></em>), the death in 1997 of her son's former wife, <a href="Diana,_Princess_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, and the deaths of her <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother" title="wikilink">mother</a> and <a href="Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">sister</a> in 2002. Elizabeth has occasionally faced <a href="Republicanism_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">republican</a> sentiments and severe press criticism of the <a href="British_Royal_Family" title="wikilink">royal family</a>, but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high.</p>

<p><img src="Queen_Elizabeth_II_1929.jpg" title="fig:Princess Elizabeth aged 3, 1929" alt="Princess Elizabeth aged 3, 1929" /> Elizabeth is the first child of <a href="George_VI" title="wikilink">Prince Albert, Duke of York</a> (later King George VI), and his wife, <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother" title="wikilink">Elizabeth, Duchess of York</a> (later Queen Elizabeth). Her father was the second son of <a href="George_V" title="wikilink">King George V</a> and <a href="Mary_of_Teck" title="wikilink">Queen Mary</a>. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat <a href="Claude_Bowes-Lyon,_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" title="wikilink">Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a>. She was born by <a href="Caesarean_section" title="wikilink">Caesarean section</a> at 2.40 am (GMT) on 21 April 1926 at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, <a href="Mayfair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mayfair</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She was <a href="Baptism" title="wikilink">baptised</a> by the <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>, <a href="Cosmo_Gordon_Lang" title="wikilink">Cosmo Gordon Lang</a>, in the private chapel of <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a> on 29 May,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after <a href="Alexandra_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">George V's mother</a>, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Her close family called her &quot;Lilibet&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> George V cherished his granddaughter, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Elizabeth's only sibling, <a href="Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Princess Margaret</a>, was four years younger. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their <a href="governess" class="uri" title="wikilink">governess</a>, <a href="Marion_Crawford" title="wikilink">Marion Crawford</a>, who was casually known as &quot;Crawfie&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> To the dismay of the royal family,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in 1950 Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled <em>The Little Princesses</em>. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness and her attitude of responsibility.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Others echoed such observations: <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> described Elizabeth when she was two as &quot;a character.

Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become Queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young and many assumed that he would marry and have children of his own.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1936, when her grandfather, <a href="George_V" title="wikilink">George V</a>, died and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year <a href="Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" title="wikilink">Edward abdicated</a>, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite <a href="Wallis_Simpson" title="wikilink">Wallis Simpson</a> provoked a constitutional crisis.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became <a href="Heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heiress presumptive</a>. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been <a href="heir_apparent" title="wikilink">heir apparent</a> and above her in the line of succession.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from <a href="Henry_Marten_(educator)" title="wikilink">Henry Marten</a>, <a href="List_of_Provosts_of_Eton_College" title="wikilink">Vice-Provost</a> of <a href="Eton_College" title="wikilink">Eton College</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> A <a href="Girl_Guides" title="wikilink">Girl Guides</a> company, the <a href="Girlguiding_London_and_South_East_England#1st_Buckingham_Palace_Company" title="wikilink">1st Buckingham Palace Company</a>, was formed specifically so that she could socialise with girls her own age.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Later she was enrolled as a <a href="Ranger_(Girl_Guide)" title="wikilink">Sea Ranger</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1939, Elizabeth's parents <a href="1939_royal_tour_of_Canada" title="wikilink">toured Canada and the United States</a>. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Elizabeth &quot;looked tearful&quot; as her parents departed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> They corresponded regularly,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and she and her parents made the first royal <a href="Transatlantic_communications_cable" title="wikilink">transatlantic telephone</a> call on 18 May.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-world-war">Second World War</h3>
<p>In September 1939, Britain entered the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, which lasted until 1945. During the war, London was frequently subject to <a href="aerial_bombing_of_cities" title="wikilink">aerial bombardment</a>, and many of London's children were <a href="Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Britain_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">evacuated</a>. The suggestion by senior politician <a href="Douglas_Hogg,_1st_Viscount_Hailsham" title="wikilink">Lord Hailsham</a> that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, &quot;The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at <a href="Balmoral_Castle" title="wikilink">Balmoral Castle</a>, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to <a href="Sandringham_House" title="wikilink">Sandringham House</a>, <a href="Norfolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> From February to May 1940, they lived at <a href="Royal_Lodge" title="wikilink">Royal Lodge</a>, Windsor, until moving to <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a>, where they lived for most of the next five years.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> At Windsor, the princesses staged <a href="pantomime" title="wikilink">pantomimes</a> at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>'s <em><a href="Children&#39;s_Hour" title="wikilink">Children's Hour</a></em>, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> She stated:  <img src="Hrh_Princess_Elizabeth_in_the_Auxiliary_Territorial_Service,_April_1945_TR2832.jpg" title="fig:Elizabeth in Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, April 1945" alt="Elizabeth in Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, April 1945" /> <img src="Special_Film_Project_186_-_Buckingham_Palace_2.jpg" title="fig:Princess Elizabeth (left) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with (left to right) her mother Queen Elizabeth, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, 8 May 1945" alt="Princess Elizabeth (left) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with (left to right) her mother Queen Elizabeth, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, 8 May 1945" /> In 1943, at the age of 16, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the <a href="Grenadier_Guards" title="wikilink">Grenadier Guards</a>, of which she had been appointed <a href="Colonel-in-Chief" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel-in-Chief</a> the previous year.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As she approached her 18th birthday, the law was changed so that she could act as one of five <a href="Counsellor_of_State" title="wikilink">Counsellors of State</a> in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In February 1945, she joined the <a href="Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" title="wikilink">Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service</a>, as an honorary Second <a href="Auxiliary_Territorial_Service#Ranks" title="wikilink">Subaltern</a> with the <a href="service_number" title="wikilink">service number</a> of 230873.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> She trained as a driver and mechanic and was promoted to honorary Junior Commander five months later.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of the war in Europe, on <a href="Victory_in_Europe_Day" title="wikilink">Victory in Europe Day</a>, the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, &quot;We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down <a href="Whitehall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitehall</a>, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>During the war, plans were drawn up to quell <a href="Welsh_nationalism" title="wikilink">Welsh nationalism</a> by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of <a href="Caernarfon_Castle" title="wikilink">Caernarfon Castle</a> or a patron of <a href="Urdd_Gobaith_Cymru" title="wikilink">Urdd Gobaith Cymru</a> (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with <a href="conscientious_objector" title="wikilink">conscientious objectors</a> in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Welsh politicians suggested that she be made <a href="Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Princess of Wales</a> on her 18th birthday. The idea was supported by the <a href="Home_Secretary" title="wikilink">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Herbert_Morrison" title="wikilink">Herbert Morrison</a>, but rejected by the King because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh <a href="Gorsedd" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gorsedd</a> of Bards at the <a href="National_Eisteddfod_of_Wales" title="wikilink">National Eisteddfod of Wales</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1947 Princess Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">British Commonwealth</a> on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: </p>
<h3 id="marriage">Marriage</h3>

<p>Elizabeth met her future husband, <a href="Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark</a>, in 1934 and 1937.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> They are <a href="Cousin#Cousin_chart" title="wikilink">second cousins once removed</a> through King <a href="Christian_IX_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Christian IX of Denmark</a> and third cousins through <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>. After another meeting at the <a href="Britannia_Royal_Naval_College" title="wikilink">Royal Naval College</a> in <a href="Dartmouth,_Devon" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a> in July 1939, Elizabeth&lt;U+2014&gt;though only 13 years old&lt;U+2014&gt;said she fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The engagement was not without controversy: Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> during the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with <a href="Nazi_Party" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> links.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Marion Crawford wrote, &quot;Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Elizabeth's mother was reported, in later biographies, to have opposed the union initially, even dubbing Philip &quot;<a href="List_of_terms_used_for_Germans#Hun" title="wikilink">The Hun</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In later life, however, she told biographer <a href="Tim_Heald" title="wikilink">Tim Heald</a> that Philip was &quot;an English gentleman&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, converted from <a href="Greek_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Greek Orthodoxy</a> to <a href="Anglicanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglicanism</a>, and adopted the style <em>Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten</em>, taking <a href="Mountbatten" title="wikilink">the surname of his mother's British family</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Just before the wedding, he was created <a href="Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Duke of Edinburgh</a> and granted the style <em>His Royal Highness</em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>. They received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required <a href="Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">ration coupons</a> to buy the material for <a href="Wedding_dress_of_Princess_Elizabeth" title="wikilink">her gown</a>, which was designed by <a href="Norman_Hartnell" title="wikilink">Norman Hartnell</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The <a href="Duke_of_Windsor" title="wikilink">Duke of Windsor</a>, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, <a href="Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Prince Charles</a>, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">letters patent</a> allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> A second child, <a href="Anne,_Princess_Royal" title="wikilink">Princess Anne</a>, was born in 1950.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Following their wedding, the couple leased <a href="Windlesham_Moor" title="wikilink">Windlesham Moor</a>, near <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a>, until 4 July 1949,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> when they took up residence at <a href="Clarence_House" title="wikilink">Clarence House</a> in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British <a href="Crown_colony" title="wikilink">Crown colony</a> of <a href="Malta_Colony" title="wikilink">Malta</a> as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently, for several months at a time, in the hamlet of <a href="Gwardaman&lt;U+0121&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gwardaman&lt;U+0121&gt;a</a>, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, <a href="Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="wikilink">Lord Mountbatten</a>.

When she toured Canada and visited <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Harry_S._Truman" title="wikilink">Harry S. Truman</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, in October 1951, her private secretary, <a href="Martin_Charteris,_Baron_Charteris_of_Amisfield" title="wikilink">Martin Charteris</a>, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of <a href="Kenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenya</a>. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, <a href="Sagana_Lodge" title="wikilink">Sagana Lodge</a>, after a night spent at <a href="Treetops_Hotel" title="wikilink">Treetops Hotel</a>, when word arrived of the death of the King. Philip broke the news to the new queen.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Martin Charteris asked her to choose a <a href="regnal_name" title="wikilink">regnal name</a>; she chose to remain Elizabeth, &quot;of course&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> She was <a href="Proclamation_of_accession_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">proclaimed queen</a> throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>With Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the <a href="royal_house" title="wikilink">royal house</a> would bear her husband's name, becoming the <em>House of Mountbatten</em>, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> and Elizabeth's grandmother, <a href="Mary_of_Teck" title="wikilink">Queen Mary</a>, favoured the retention of the <a href="House_of_Windsor" title="wikilink">House of Windsor</a>, and so <em>Windsor</em> it remained. The Duke complained, &quot;I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname <em><a href="Mountbatten-Windsor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mountbatten-Windsor</a></em> was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>Amid preparations for <a href="Coronation_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">the coronation</a>, <a href="Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Princess Margaret</a> informed her sister that she wished to marry <a href="Peter_Townsend_(RAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Peter Townsend</a>, a divorcee 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, &quot;the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought&lt;U+2014&gt;she hoped&lt;U+2014&gt;given time, the affair would peter out.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Senior politicians were against the match and the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> did not permit re-marriage after divorce. If Margaret contracted a civil marriage, she would be expected to renounce her right of succession.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In 1960, she married <a href="Antony_Armstrong-Jones,_1st_Earl_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Antony Armstrong-Jones</a>, who was created <a href="Earl_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Earl of Snowdon</a> the following year. They were divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation went ahead, as Mary had asked before she died, taking place as planned on 2 June 1953.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The ceremony in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>, with the exception of the <a href="anointing" class="uri" title="wikilink">anointing</a> and <a href="Eucharist" title="wikilink">communion</a>, was televised for the first time.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="Coronation_gown_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth's coronation gown</a> was commissioned from <a href="Norman_Hartnell" title="wikilink">Norman Hartnell</a> and embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of the Commonwealth countries:<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> English <a href="Tudor_rose" title="wikilink">Tudor rose</a>; Scots <a href="thistle" class="uri" title="wikilink">thistle</a>; Welsh <a href="leek" class="uri" title="wikilink">leek</a>; Irish <a href="shamrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">shamrock</a>; Australian <a href="Acacia_pycnantha" title="wikilink">wattle</a>; Canadian <a href="maple_leaf" title="wikilink">maple leaf</a>; New Zealand <a href="Cyathea_dealbata" title="wikilink">silver fern</a>; South African <a href="protea" class="uri" title="wikilink">protea</a>; <a href="Nelumbo_nucifera" title="wikilink">lotus flowers</a> for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's <a href="wheat" class="uri" title="wikilink">wheat</a>, <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a>, and <a href="jute" class="uri" title="wikilink">jute</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>The Queen witnessed, over her life, the continued transformation of the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a> into the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Nations</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Spanning 1953&lt;U+2013&gt;54, the Queen and her husband embarked on a six-month around-the-world tour. She became the first reigning <a href="Monarchy_of_Australia" title="wikilink">monarch of Australia</a> and <a href="Monarchy_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> to visit those nations.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Throughout her reign, the Queen has undertaken <a href="List_of_state_visits_made_by_Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">state visits</a> to foreign countries and <a href="List_of_Commonwealth_visits_made_by_Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">tours of Commonwealth ones</a> and she is the most widely travelled head of state in history.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1956, <a href="Prime_Minister_of_France" title="wikilink">French Prime Minister</a> <a href="Guy_Mollet" title="wikilink">Guy Mollet</a> and <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Prime Minister</a> Sir <a href="Anthony_Eden" title="wikilink">Anthony Eden</a> discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Treaty of Rome</a>, which established the <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">European Economic Community</a>, the precursor of the European Union.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In November 1956, Britain and France invaded <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> in an <a href="Suez_Crisis" title="wikilink">ultimately unsuccessful attempt</a> to capture the <a href="Suez_Canal" title="wikilink">Suez Canal</a>. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>The absence of a formal mechanism within the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a> for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to <a href="Kissing_hands" title="wikilink">commission to form a government</a>. Eden recommended that she consult <a href="Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_5th_Marquess_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Lord Salisbury</a>, the <a href="Lord_President_of_the_Council" title="wikilink">Lord President of the Council</a>. Lord Salisbury and <a href="David_Maxwell_Fyfe,_1st_Earl_of_Kilmuir" title="wikilink">Lord Kilmuir</a>, the <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, consulted the <a href="Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Cabinet</a>, <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a>, and the Chairman of the backbench <a href="1922_Committee" title="wikilink">1922 Committee</a>, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: <a href="Harold_Macmillan" title="wikilink">Harold Macmillan</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="John_Grigg,_2nd_Baron_Altrincham" title="wikilink">Lord Altrincham</a> accused her of being &quot;out of touch&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Altrincham was denounced by public figures and physically attacked by a member of the public appalled by his comments.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the <a href="Alec_Douglas-Home" title="wikilink">Earl of Home</a> as prime minister, advice that she followed.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> </p>
<p>In 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a> on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the <a href="23rd_Canadian_Parliament" title="wikilink">23rd Canadian parliament</a>, becoming the first <a href="Monarchy_of_Canada" title="wikilink">monarch of Canada</a> to open a parliamentary session.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> despite learning upon landing at <a href="St._John&#39;s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>, that she was pregnant with her third child.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> On a visit to <a href="Ghana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghana</a> the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, <a href="List_of_heads_of_state_of_Ghana" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Kwame_Nkrumah" title="wikilink">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Harold Macmillan wrote, &quot;The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ...

Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government.

Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1974, British Prime Minister <a href="Edward_Heath" title="wikilink">Edward Heath</a> advised the Queen to call a <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974" title="wikilink">general election</a> in the middle of her tour of the <a href="Austronesia" title="wikilink">Austronesian</a> <a href="Pacific_Rim" title="wikilink">Pacific Rim</a>, requiring her to fly back to Britain.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberals</a>.
