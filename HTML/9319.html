<p><strong>American Airlines Flight 77</strong> was the third flight <a href="Aircraft_hijacking" title="wikilink">hijacked</a> as part of the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, and it was deliberately crashed into the <a href="The_Pentagon" title="wikilink">Pentagon</a>. The scheduled <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> domestic flight from <a href="Washington_Dulles_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Washington Dulles International Airport</a>, near <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, to <a href="Los_Angeles_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Los Angeles International Airport</a> was hijacked by five individuals less than 35 minutes into the flight. The hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers to the rear of the aircraft. <a href="Hani_Hanjour" title="wikilink">Hani Hanjour</a>, one of the hijackers trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard were able to make calls to loved ones and relay information on the hijacking.</p>
<p>The aircraft crashed into the western facade of the Pentagon at 09:37 <a href="Eastern_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">Eastern Time</a>. All 64 people on board and 125 in the building were killed, including the hijackers. Dozens of people witnessed the crash and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and ignited a large fire. A portion of the Pentagon collapsed and firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze. Subsequent investigation recovered hundreds of identifiable human remains. The damage to the Pentagon was later rebuilt and as of 2008, an outdoor memorial is being completed at the crash site.</p>

<p>The <a href="9/11_Commission" title="wikilink">9/11 Commission</a> estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, just minutes after <a href="American_Airlines_Flight_11" title="wikilink">the first hijacked plane</a> had struck the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a> at 08:46.

The <a href="Federal_Aviation_Administration" title="wikilink">FAA</a> was aware at this point that there was an emergency aboard the plane. By this time, <a href="American_Airlines_Flight_11" title="wikilink">American Airlines Flight 11</a> had already crashed into the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>, and <a href="United_Airlines_Flight_175" title="wikilink">United Airlines Flight 175</a> was known to have been hijacked. After learning of this second hijacking involving American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving <a href="United_Airlines" title="wikilink">United Airlines</a>, American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft.

<p>Two people on American Airlines Flight 77 made phone calls to contacts on the ground.

<p>As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they &quot;pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation.
