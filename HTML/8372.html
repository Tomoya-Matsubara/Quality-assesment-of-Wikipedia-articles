<p><strong><em>Klonoa Beach Volleyball</em></strong> is a sports spin-off from the Klonoa video game series released as a budget title in the last few years of the Playstation's commercial lifespan. It's release was limited to Japan and Europe only, Namco deciding not to bother with an American release. It features characters from the Playsation and Gameboy games in the series, and can most likely be considered non-canonical in this sense, as many of these characters would never meet in the main story.</p>
<p>This is also the first Klonoa title to feature a multiplayer mode, allowing up to four players to compete in pairs against the other team. The game also allows for controller sharing, should the players not be in possession of a multi-tap.</p>
