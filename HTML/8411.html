<p><a href="Major" class="uri" title="wikilink">Major</a> <strong>James Matthew Stronge</strong> (21 June 1932 – 21 January 1981) was a soldier and <a href="Ulster_unionism" title="wikilink">Unionist</a> MP in the <a href="Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Parliament of Northern Ireland</a>, and the later <a href="Northern_Ireland_Assembly,_1973" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Assembly</a>. He was the son and heir of <a href="Norman_Stronge" title="wikilink">Sir Norman Stronge, Bt</a>, who were both killed by the <a href="Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> at his family home, <a href="Tynan_Abbey" title="wikilink">Tynan Abbey</a>.</p>
<h2 id="life-and-career">Life and career</h2>
<p>Born into an aristocratic family, he was educated at <a href="Eton_College" title="wikilink">Eton College</a> and <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.</p>
<p>He served as <a href="Ulster_Unionist" title="wikilink">Ulster Unionist</a> <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for Mid-Armagh for three years until the prorogation of <a href="Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Stormont</a> in 1972 and a member of the <a href="Northern_Ireland_Assembly,_1973" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973</a>-1974.</p>
<p>Stronge was also an officer in the <a href="Grenadier_Guards" title="wikilink">Grenadier Guards</a>. Having withdrawn from political and military life, his main interests since were confined to <a href="merchant_banking" title="wikilink">merchant banking</a> and service as a <a href="Royal_Ulster_Constabulary" title="wikilink">RUC</a> Reserve Constable.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Stronge was killed alongside his elderly father Sir <a href="Norman_Stronge" title="wikilink">Norman</a>, by the <a href="Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> in the library of his home, <a href="Tynan_Abbey" title="wikilink">Tynan Abbey</a>, on the evening of 21 January 1981.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Stronge_Baronets" title="wikilink">Stronge family's</a> home was then burnt to the ground. The bodies of father and son were later recovered from their blazing home. On seeing the explosions at the house (and a <a href="Flare_(pyrotechnic)" title="wikilink">flare</a> Sir Norman had lit in an attempt to alert the authorities), <a href="Royal_Ulster_Constabulary" title="wikilink">policemen</a> and British troops arrived at the scene and established a road-block at the gate lodge. They encountered at least eight fleeing gunmen. There followed a gunfight lasting 20 minutes in which at least 200 shots were fired. There were no casualties among the security forces.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Author <a href="Tim_Pat_Coogan" title="wikilink">Tim Pat Coogan</a> stated that Sir Norman Stronge and his son were shot because sectarian assassinations were claiming the lives of Catholics, but did not state that they were involved in these killings.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As Stronge was shot alongside his father, and it is not known who was shot first, he is presumed to have momentarily succeeded as 9th Baronet under the <a href="legal_fiction" title="wikilink">legal fiction</a> known as the doctrine of survival.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. (This claim is disputed <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Son and father were buried in <a href="Tynan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tynan</a> Parish church, at his funeral a telegram sent from the Queen (to one of Sir Norman's daughters) was read, it stated; &quot;I was deeply shocked to learn of the tragic death of your father and brother; Prince Philip joins me in sending you and your sister all our deepest sympathy on your dreadful loss. Sir Norman's loyal and distinguished service will be remembered&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1984, Seamus Shannon was arrested by the <a href="Garda_S&lt;U+00ED&gt;och&lt;U+00E1&gt;na" title="wikilink">Garda S&lt;U+00ED&gt;och&lt;U+00E1&gt;na</a> in the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> and handed over to the RUC on a warrant accusing him of involvement in the killing of the Sir Norman and his son. The <a href="Irish_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Irish Supreme Court</a> considering his extradition to <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a> rejected the defence that these were political offences saying that they were &quot;so brutal, cowardly and callous that it would be a distortion of language if they were to be accorded the status of a political offence&quot;. The charges were later dropped against Shannon.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
