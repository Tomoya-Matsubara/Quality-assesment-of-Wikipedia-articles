It began with the <a href="Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">collapse</a> of the <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a>, and was followed by the <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="Age_of_Discovery" title="wikilink">Age of Discovery</a>. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the traditional division of Western history into Classical, Medieval, and Modern periods. The period is subdivided into the <a href="Early_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Early Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="High_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">High Middle Ages</a>, and the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a>.</p>
<p>In the Early Middle Ages, depopulation, deurbanization, and <a href="barbarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">barbarian</a> invasions, which began in <a href="Late_Antiquity" title="wikilink">Late Antiquity</a>, continued. The barbarian invaders formed new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a> and the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>, once part of the Eastern Roman Empire (the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>), became an <a href="Caliphate" title="wikilink">Islamic Empire</a> after conquest by <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a>'s <a href="Succession_to_Muhammad" title="wikilink">successors</a>. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with <a href="Classical_Antiquity" title="wikilink">Antiquity</a> was not complete. The still sizeable Byzantine Empire survived and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the <a href="Code_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">Code of Justinian</a>, was widely admired. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated extant Roman institutions, while monasteries were founded as Christianity expanded in western Europe. The <a href="Franks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Franks</a>, under the <a href="Carolingian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Carolingian dynasty</a>, established an empire covering much of western Europe; the <a href="Carolingian_Empire" title="wikilink">Carolingian Empire</a> endured until the 9th century, when it succumbed to the pressures of invasion &lt;U+2014&gt; the <a href="Viking" title="wikilink">Vikings</a> from the north; the <a href="Magyars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magyars</a> from the east, and the <a href="Saracen" title="wikilink">Saracens</a> from the south.</p>
<p>During the High Middle Ages, which began after AD 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. <a href="Manorialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manorialism</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the organization of peasants into villages that owed rent and labor services to the <a href="Nobility" title="wikilink">nobles</a>; and <a href="feudalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudalism</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the political structure whereby <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knights</a> and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords, in return for the right to rent from lands and <a href="manor" title="wikilink">manors</a> - were two of the ways society was organized in the High Middle Ages. The <a href="Crusades" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crusades</a>, first preached in 1095, were military attempts, by western European Christians, to regain control of the Middle Eastern <a href="Holy_Land" title="wikilink">Holy Land</a> from the <a href="Muslims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>. Kings became the heads of centralized nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified <a href="Christendom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christendom</a> more distant. Intellectual life was marked by <a href="scholasticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholasticism</a>, a philosophy which emphasized joining faith to reason, and by the founding of <a href="University" title="wikilink">universities</a>. The mathematics of <a href="Fibonacci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fibonacci</a> and <a href="Oresme" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oresme</a>, the philosophy of <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a>, the paintings of <a href="Giotto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Giotto</a>, the poetry of <a href="Dante" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dante</a> and <a href="Chaucer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaucer</a>, the travels of <a href="Marco_Polo" title="wikilink">Marco Polo</a>, and the architecture of <a href="gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> cathedrals such as <a href="Chartres_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Chartres</a> are among the outstanding achievements of this period.</p>
<p>The Late Middle Ages were marked by difficulties and calamities, such as famine, plague, and war, which much diminished the population of western Europe; in the four years from 1347 through 1350, the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> killed approximately a third of the European population. Controversy, <a href="heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">heresy</a>, and <a href="Western_Schism" title="wikilink">schism</a> within the Church paralleled the warfare between states, the civil war, and peasant revolts occurring in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the <a href="Early_Modern_period" title="wikilink">Early Modern period</a>.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analyzing <a href="European_history" title="wikilink">European history</a>: classical civilization, or <a href="Classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">Antiquity</a>, the Middle Ages, and the <a href="modern_period" title="wikilink">modern period</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Leonardo_Bruni" title="wikilink">Leonardo Bruni</a> was the first historian to use <a href="Late_Middle_Ages#Historiography_and_periodization" title="wikilink">tripartite periodization</a> in his <em>History of the Florentine People</em> (1442).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The &quot;Middle Ages&quot; first appears in Latin in 1469 as <em>media tempestas</em> or &quot;middle season&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In early usage, there were many variants, including <em>medium aevum</em>, or &quot;middle age&quot;, first recorded in 1604,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and <em>media scecula</em>, or &quot;middle ages&quot;, first recorded in 1625.

<p>Medieval historians divided history into periods such as the &quot;<a href="Six_Ages_of_the_World" title="wikilink">Six Ages</a>&quot; or the &quot;<a href="Four_monarchies" title="wikilink">Four Empires</a>&quot;, with their period being the last before the end of the world.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> They considered the Roman period, especially the time of the <a href="Apostle_(Christian)" title="wikilink">Apostles</a>, an historical peak, followed by a long slide toward the <a href="Apocalypse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apocalypse</a>. In the 1330s, the humanist and poet <a href="Petrarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrarch</a> referred to pre-Christian times as <em>antiqua</em> (or &quot;ancient&quot;) and to the Christian period as <em>nova</em> (or &quot;new&quot;).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> While retaining the theme of decline from the apogee of ancient Rome, Petrarch's division was not based on theology, but on a perception of cultural and political decline.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch's time, and therefore added a third period to Petrarch's two.</p>

<p>Historians in the Romance languages tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier &quot;High&quot; and later &quot;Low&quot; period.

<p>Although the political structure in western Europe had changed, the divide is not as extensive as some historians have claimed. Although usually described as &quot;invasions&quot;, they were not always just military expeditions but were mostly caused by the movement of peoples immigrating into the Empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to either support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as <a href="Stilicho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stilicho</a> (d. 408), <a href="Ricimer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ricimer</a> (d. 472), <a href="Gundobad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gundobad</a> (d. 516), or <a href="Aspar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aspar</a> (d. 471), and when the western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background as those military strongmen. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This led to a fusion of the Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies which allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Material artifacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, with tribal items often being obviously modeled on Roman objects.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Similarly, much of the intellectual culture of the new kingdoms was directly based on Roman intellectual traditions.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer provided their armies with tax revenues, instead allocating land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms.

The Frankish kingdom was centered in northeastern Gaul and the first king of whom much is known is <a href="Childeric_I" title="wikilink">Childeric</a>, who died in 481. Under Childeric's son <a href="Clovis_I" title="wikilink">Clovis</a> (r. 509&lt;U+2013&gt;511), the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the natives of Britannia, settled in what is now Brittany, which took its name from their settlement.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Other kingdoms were established by the Visigoths in Spain, the Suevi in northwestern Spain, and the Vandals in North Africa.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In the 6th century, the <a href="Lombards" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lombards</a> settled in northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of <a href="Duchy" title="wikilink">duchies</a> that occasionally selected a king to rule over all of them. By the late 6th century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>With the invasions came new ethnic groups into parts of Europe, but the settlement was uneven, with some regions such as Spain having a larger settlement of new peoples than other places. Gaul's settlement was uneven, with the barbarians settling much thicker in the northeast than in the southwest. <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Slavonic</a> peoples settled in central and eastern Europe and into the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on Latin but distinct. These changes from Latin to the new languages like French or Portuguese or Romanian took many centuries, however, and went through a number of stages. Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the <a href="Slavs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavs</a> added <a href="Slavonic_languages" title="wikilink">Slavonic languages</a> to the mix.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the Empire, with the majority occurring in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of <a href="Roman_law" title="wikilink">Roman law</a> known as the <em><a href="Theodosian_Code" title="wikilink">Theodosian Code</a></em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Under the emperor <a href="Justinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justinian</a> (r. 527&lt;U+2013&gt;565), a further compilation took place, known as the <em><a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Corpus Juris Civilis</a></em>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Justinian also oversaw the construction of the <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a> in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths. The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> At the emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have often been criticized for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the Muslim conquests. Many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to overtaxation for Justinian's wars, but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire which made raising troops difficult.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In the eastern empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further complication. Although it began as a small invasion, by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium, and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551. In the 560s the <a href="Eurasian_Avars" title="wikilink">Avars</a> began to expand from their base on the north bank of the <a href="Danube_River" title="wikilink">Danube River</a>; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to give tribute. They remained a strong power until 796.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Further complications were the involvement of the emperor <a href="Maurice_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Maurice</a> (r. 582&lt;U+2013&gt;602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace but when Maurice was overthrown in turn, the Persians invaded and during the reign of the emperor <a href="Heraclius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heraclius</a> (r. 610&lt;U+2013&gt;641) managed to control large chunks of the Empire, including Egypt, Syria, and <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a>. Heraclius was eventually able to secure a peace treaty with the Persians in 628 that restored the earlier boundaries of the Empire.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="western-society">Western society</h3>
<p>Society in Western Europe changed with the new rulers. Some of the Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs. The older values of Latin classics scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained an important skill, it became a practical skill. In the 4th century, <a href="Jerome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerome</a> dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading <a href="Cicero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> than the Bible. By the 6th century, <a href="Gregory_of_Tours" title="wikilink">Gregory of Tours</a> had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning <a href="shorthand" class="uri" title="wikilink">shorthand</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> By the late 6th century, the principal means of instruction in the Church ceased to be the book and was replaced with music and art.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> With laymen, a similar change took place, with the aristocratic culture focusing on great feasts held in halls. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces of the time. Family ties between the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds, however, seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation usually ending the feud.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in terms of their functions as wives or mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society, the lack of many child rulers meant less role for women as queen mothers but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were considered as always under the protection and control of some male relative.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform, with some areas having greatly fragmented landholding patterns and other areas with a pattern of large, contiguous blocks of land being the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies with some being dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, however, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over a number of generations through military service to a powerful lord.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited places, they contracted greatly in size. Rome shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the end of the sixth century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and the city walls remained in use.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while the public monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rise-of-islam">Rise of Islam</h3>

<p><img src="Map_of_expansion_of_Caliphate.svg" title="fig:The Islamic Empire and the caliphs during their greatest extent, 622&lt;U+2013&gt;750" alt="The Islamic Empire and the caliphs during their greatest extent, 622&lt;U+2013&gt;750" width="300" /> Religious beliefs in the eastern empire and Persia were in flux during the late 6th and early 7th centuries. <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a> was an active proselytising faith, and at least one Arab political leader converted to Judaism. Christianity had active missions competing with the Persian's <a href="Zoroastrianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrianism</a> in seeking converts, especially amongst residents of the Arabian peninsula. All strands came together with emergence of <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a> in Arabia during the lifetime of <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> After Muhammad's death in 632, Islamic forces went on to conquer much of the eastern Empire as well as Persia, starting with Syria in 634&lt;U+2013&gt;635 and later as far as Egypt in 640&lt;U+2013&gt;641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later 7th century and the Iberian Peninsula in 711.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>The Islamic conquests only slowed in the middle of the 8th century. The first check was the defeat of Muslim forces at the <a href="Battle_of_Tours" title="wikilink">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 732, which led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks. But the main reason for the ebbing of Islamic conquests in Europe was the overthrow of the <a href="Umayyad_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Umayyad dynasty</a> and its replacement by the <a href="Abbasid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Abbasid dynasty</a>. The Abbasids moved their capital to <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a> and their interests were more concerned with the Middle East rather than Europe. The Abbasids lost control of sections of the Muslim lands - with Umayyad descendants taking over Spain along with the <a href="Aghlabid" title="wikilink">Aghlabids</a> controlling North Africa and the <a href="Tulunid" title="wikilink">Tulunids</a> ruling Egypt.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean, with trade between the Franks and the Arabs replacing the old Roman patterns of trade. Franks traded timber, furs, swords and slaves to the Arabs in return for silks and other fabrics, spices, and precious metals.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trade-and-economy">Trade and economy</h3>
<p>The barbarian invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries caused disruption in trade networks around the Mediterranean. African trade goods disappear from the archeological record slowly, first disappearing from the interior of Europe and by the 7th century they are usually only found in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products are no longer found in Western Europe, and have been mostly replaced by local products. The replacement of trade goods with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. What non-local goods that appear in the archeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but those goods that were produced were simple, with little use of pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean Sea, however, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium range networks and not just produced locally.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and western Europe before the Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between the areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church, which became the <a href="Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Orthodox Church</a>, differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the western Church, which became the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a>. The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as <a href="iconoclasm" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconoclasm</a>, <a href="clerical_marriage" title="wikilink">clerical marriage</a>, and state control of the church had widened enough that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The formal break came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and mutually <a href="excommunicate" title="wikilink">excommunicated</a> each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two churches &lt;U+2013&gt; the <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="wikt:ecclesiastical" title="wikilink">ecclesiastical</a> structure of the Roman Empire survived the barbarian invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, with few of the western bishops looking to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. Many of the popes prior to 750 were in any case more concerned with Byzantine affairs and eastern theological concerns. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope <a href="Gregory_the_Great" title="wikilink">Gregory the Great</a>, (pope 590&lt;U+2013&gt;604) survives, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the <a href="Gregorian_mission" title="wikilink">Gregorian mission</a> in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Other missionary efforts were led by the Irish, who between the 5th and the 7th centuries were the most active missionaries in western Europe, with missionaries going first to England and Scotland and then later onto the continent. Irish <a href="missionary" title="wikilink">missionaries</a>, under such monks as <a href="Columba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Columba</a> (d. 597) and <a href="Columbanus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Columbanus</a> (d. 615), not only founded monasteries but also taught in Latin and Greek and were active authors of secular and religious works.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of <a href="Christian_monasticism" title="wikilink">monasticism</a> in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated in the deserts of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>. The style of monasticism that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called <a href="Cenobitic" title="wikilink">cenobitism</a>, was pioneered by <a href="Pachomius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pachomius</a> (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through <a href="Hagiography" title="wikilink">hagiographical literature</a> such as the <em><a href="Anthony_the_Great" title="wikilink">Life of Anthony</a></em>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> <a href="Benedict_of_Nursia" title="wikilink">Benedict of Nursia</a> (d. 547) wrote the <a href="Benedictine_Rule" title="wikilink">Benedictine Rule</a> for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an <a href="abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">abbot</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, bases for mission, and proselytization.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> In addition, they were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Roman <a href="classical_literature" title="wikilink">classics</a> were copied in monasteries in the early Middle Ages.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, which were written by authors such as <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a> (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th century.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

Later members of his family line inherited the office, acting as advisors and regents. One of his descendents, <a href="Charles_Martel" title="wikilink">Charles Martel</a> (d. 741), won the <a href="Battle_of_Tours" title="wikilink">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Muslim armies had earlier conquered the Visigothic kingdom of Spain, after defeating the last Visigothic king <a href="Ruderic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruderic</a> (d. 711 or 712) at the <a href="Battle_of_Guadalete" title="wikilink">Battle of Guadalete</a> in 711, finishing the conquest by 719.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Across the English Channel in the British Isles, the island of Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of <a href="Northumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumbria</a>, <a href="Mercia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercia</a>, <a href="Wessex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wessex</a>, and <a href="East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglia</a>, which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders.

A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought, and gained, authority for this coup from Pope  (pope 752&lt;U+2013&gt;757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers and exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768&lt;U+2013&gt;814) and <a href="Carloman,_son_of_Pippin_III" title="wikilink">Carloman</a> (r. 768&lt;U+2013&gt;771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's minor son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, known to his contemporaries as Charles the Great or <a href="Charlemagne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charlemagne</a>, embarked in 774 upon a program of systematic expansion that would unify a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and Saxony. In the wars that lasted just beyond 800, he rewarded loyal allies with war booty and command over parcels of land.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In 774, Charlemagne conquered the <a href="Lombard" title="wikilink">Lombards</a>, which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the <a href="Papal_States" title="wikilink">Papal States</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning-point in medieval history, marking a return of the western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalency to the eastern empire.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> However, there were a number of differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with few cities, and what cities existed were very small. Farming techniques were not advanced, and most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the northern realms of the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire which had its trading networks centered on the Mediterranean.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The administration of the empire was from an itinerant court that traveled with the emperor as well as through approximately 300 imperial officials called <a href="count" title="wikilink">counts</a>, who administered the <a href="counties" class="uri" title="wikilink">counties</a> which the empire had been divided into.

<p>Charlemagne's court in <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a> was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the &quot;<a href="Carolingian_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Carolingian Renaissance</a>&quot;. The period saw an increase in literacy, developments in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk <a href="Alcuin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alcuin</a> (d. 804) was invited to Aachen, and brought the <a href="classical_Latin" title="wikilink">classical Latin</a> education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's <a href="Chancery_(medieval_office)" title="wikilink">chancery</a> made use of a new script today known as <a href="Carolingian_minuscule" title="wikilink">Carolingian minuscule</a>, allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the <a href="Gregorian_chant" title="wikilink">Gregorian chant</a> form of liturgical music in the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encourage learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>While Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, this ended when only one son, <a href="Louis_the_Pious" title="wikilink">Louis the Pious</a> (r. 814&lt;U+2013&gt;840), was still alive by 813. That year, Charlemagne crowned Louis as his successor, and died in 814. Louis's long reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, numerous civil wars between various alliances of father and sons against other sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognized his eldest son  (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and <a href="Charles_the_Bald" title="wikilink">Charles the Bald</a> (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took <a href="East_Francia" title="wikilink">East Francia</a>, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles <a href="West_Francia" title="wikilink">West Francia</a> with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. <a href="Louis_the_German" title="wikilink">Louis the German</a> (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the <a href="wikt:suzerainty" title="wikilink">suzerainty</a> of his elder brother. The division was not undisputed. <a href="Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink"> of Aquitaine</a> (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for <a href="Aquitaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aquitaine</a>, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>A three-year civil war followed his death. By the <a href="Treaty_of_Verdun" title="wikilink">Treaty of Verdun</a> (843), a kingdom between the <a href="Rhine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhine</a> and <a href="Rhone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhone</a> rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognized. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>Missionary efforts to Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped strengthen the growth of kingdoms there. Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian kingdoms gained power and territory in the course of the 9th and 10th centuries, and some of the kings converted to Christianity, although the process was not complete by 1000. Scandinavians also expanded and colonized throughout Europe. Besides the settlements in Ireland, England, and Normandy, further settlement took place in what became Russia as well as in Iceland.

The creation of <a href="cataphract" class="uri" title="wikilink">cataphract</a>-type soldiers was an important feature of the 5th century. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers - ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths which had a high percentage of cavalry in their armies.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> During the early invasion period, the <a href="stirrup" class="uri" title="wikilink">stirrup</a> had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops, but not to the extent that has generally been proclaimed. It was still possible for cavalry to use shock tactics in battle, especially when the saddle was built up in front and back to allow greater support to the rider.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The greatest changes in military affairs during the invasion was the adoption of the Hunnic <a href="composite_bow" title="wikilink">composite bow</a> in place of the earlier, and weaker, <a href="Scythian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scythian</a> composite bow.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Another development of the invasion period was the increasing use of <a href="longsword" title="wikilink">longswords</a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and the decrease in the use of <a href="scale_armour" title="wikilink">scale armour</a> and the increasing use of <a href="Mail_(armour)" title="wikilink">mail amour</a> and <a href="lamellar_armour" title="wikilink">lamellar armour</a>.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>

Rough estimates of the increase from the year 1000 until 1347 indicate that the population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million. The exact cause or causes of the growth remain unclear; improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a <a href="Medieval_Warm_Period" title="wikilink">more clement climate</a> and the lack of invasion have all been put forward.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> As much as 90 percent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many of them, however, were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as <a href="manorialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">manorialism</a>. There remained, however, a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>Other sections of society included the nobility, clergy and townsmen. Nobles, both the <a href="titled_nobility" title="wikilink">titled</a> and simple <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knights</a>, were the exploiters of the manors and the peasants, although they did not own lands outright, rather they were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the customs of <a href="feudalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudalism</a>. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or <a href="fiefdom" title="wikilink">fiefs</a>, came to be considered hereditary and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as <a href="heavy_cavalry" title="wikilink">heavy cavalry</a>, control of <a href="castle" title="wikilink">castles</a>, and the various immunities from taxes or other impositions that the nobles enjoyed. Heavy cavalry had been introduced into Europe from the Persian <a href="cataphract" class="uri" title="wikilink">cataphract</a> of the 5th and 6th centuries, but the addition of the <a href="stirrup" class="uri" title="wikilink">stirrup</a> in the 7th allowed the full force of the horse and rider to be used in combat. Stone castles began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorders of the time, and allowed inhabitants to take refuge from invaders. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> <img src="Limbourg_brothers_-_Les_tr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s_riches_heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_January_(detail)_-_WGA13017.jpg" title="fig:John, Duke of Berry enjoying a grand meal; Tr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, ca 1410." alt="John, Duke of Berry enjoying a grand meal; Tr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, ca 1410." width="210" /> The clergy was divided into two types &lt;U+2013&gt; the <a href="secular_clergy" title="wikilink">secular clergy</a> who lived in the world, and the <a href="regular_clergy" title="wikilink">regular clergy</a>, or those who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the ranks of the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy.

<p>The High Middle Ages is a formative period in the history of the Western state.

<p>In the 11th century, the <a href="Seljuk_Turk" title="wikilink">Seljuk Turks</a> took over much of the Middle East, taking the ancient lands of Persia during the 1040s, Armenia in the 1060s, and capturing Jerusalem in 1070. In 1071, the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the <a href="Battle_of_Manzikert" title="wikilink">Battle of Manzikert</a> and captured the Byzantine Emperor <a href="Romanus_IV" title="wikilink">Romanus IV</a> (r. 1068&lt;U+2013&gt;1071). This allowed the Turks to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of the empire's population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines managed to regroup and recover somewhat, they never regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also ran into difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to the <a href="Fatimids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fatimids</a> of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>The Crusades intended to seize <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a> from Muslim control.

<p>During the 11th century, developments in philosophy and theology began to stimulate intellectual activity. There was debate between the <a href="realists" class="uri" title="wikilink">realists</a> and the <a href="nominalists" class="uri" title="wikilink">nominalists</a> over the concept of &quot;<a href="Universal_(metaphysics)" title="wikilink">universals</a>&quot;. Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> and his emphasis on <a href="empiricism" class="uri" title="wikilink">empiricism</a> and rationalism. Scholars such as <a href="Peter_Abelard" title="wikilink">Peter Abelard</a> (d. 1142) and <a href="Peter_Lombard" title="wikilink">Peter Lombard</a> (d. 1164) introduced <a href="Term_logic" title="wikilink">Aristotelian logic</a> into theology. The late 11th and early 12th century also saw the rise of <a href="cathedral_schools" title="wikilink">cathedral schools</a> throughout western Europe, which signaled the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Cathedral schools were then in turn replaced in the late 11th century by the <a href="medieval_university" title="wikilink">universities</a> established in major European cities.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Philosophy and theology fused in <a href="scholasticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholasticism</a>, an attempt by 12th and 13th-century scholars to reconcile Christian theology with itself, which eventually resulted in a system of thought that tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> This culminated in the thought of <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a> (d. 1274), who wrote the <em><a href="Summa_Theologica" title="wikilink">Summa Theologica</a></em>, or <em>Summary of Theology</em>.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>Besides the universities, royal and noble courts saw the development of <a href="chivalry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chivalry</a> and the ethos of <a href="courtly_love" title="wikilink">courtly love</a>. This culture was expressed in the <a href="vernacular_languages" title="wikilink">vernacular languages</a> rather than <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, and comprised poems, stories, legends and popular songs spread by troubadors. Often the stories were written down in the <em><a href="chansons_de_geste" title="wikilink">chansons de geste</a></em>, or &quot;songs of great deeds&quot;, such as <em><a href="The_Song_of_Roland" title="wikilink">The Song of Roland</a></em> or <em><a href="Hildebrand" title="wikilink">The Song of Hildebrand</a></em>.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Besides these products of chivalry, other writers composed histories, both secular and religious.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> <a href="Geoffrey_of_Monmouth" title="wikilink">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> (d. around 1155) composed his <em><a href="Historia_Regum_Britanniae" title="wikilink">Historia Regum Britanniae</a></em>, which was a collection of stories and legends about <a href="King_Arthur" title="wikilink">Arthur</a>.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Other works were more clearly history, such as <a href="Otto_von_Freising" title="wikilink">Otto von Freising</a>'s (d. 1158) <em>Gesta Friderici Imperatoris</em> detailing the deeds of Emperor <a href="Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick I</a> or <a href="William_of_Malmesbury" title="wikilink">William of Malmesbury</a>'s (d. around 1143) <em>Gesta Regum</em> on the kings of England.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
<p>Legal studies also advanced during the 12th century. Both secular law and <a href="canon_law" title="wikilink">canon law</a>, or ecclesiastical law, were studied in the High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was advanced greatly by the discovery of the <em><a href="corpus_iuris_civilis" title="wikilink">corpus iuris civilis</a></em> in the 11th century, and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at <a href="Bologna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bologna</a>. This teaching of Roman law led to the recording and standardization of legal codes throughout western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named <a href="Decretum_Gratiani" title="wikilink">Gratian</a> (flourished 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law &lt;U+2013&gt; the <em><a href="Decretum_Gratiani" title="wikilink">Decretum</a></em>.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of <a href="Roman_numerals" title="wikilink">Roman numerals</a> with the <a href="decimal" class="uri" title="wikilink">decimal</a> <a href="positional_number_system" title="wikilink">positional number system</a> and the invention of <a href="algebra" class="uri" title="wikilink">algebra</a>, which allowed more advanced mathematics.

<p>A major agricultural innovation was the development of a 3-field <a href="Crop_rotation" title="wikilink">rotation system</a> for planting crops. The development of the <a href="Plough" title="wikilink">heavy plow</a> allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, an advance that was helped along by the spread of the <a href="horse_collar" title="wikilink">horse collar</a>, which led to the use of <a href="Working_animal" title="wikilink">draught horses</a> in place of oxen.

<p>Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church. The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by <a href="Pope_Leo_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Leo IX</a> (pope 1049&lt;U+2013&gt;1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the <a href="Investiture_Controversy" title="wikilink">Investiture Controversy</a> in the late 11th century. This involved <a href="Pope_Gregory_VII" title="wikilink">Pope Gregory VII</a> (pope 1073&lt;U+2013&gt;1085) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, disputes that turned into a battle over the ideas of <a href="investiture" class="uri" title="wikilink">investiture</a>, clerical marriage, and <a href="simony" class="uri" title="wikilink">simony</a>. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands. The papacy, however, insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords These issues themselves remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the <a href="Concordat_of_Worms" title="wikilink">Concordat of Worms</a>. The conflict represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to <a href="lay_person" title="wikilink">lay</a> authorities.

<p>The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements. Besides the Crusaders and monastic reformers, other people sought to participate in new forms of religious life.

<p>These troubles were followed in 1347 by the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a>, a disease that spread throughout Europe in the years 1348, 1349, and 1350.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> The death toll was probably about 35 million people in total in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of the crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Because of the sudden decline in available labourers, the price of wages rose as landlords sought to entice workers to their fields, but the lower rents were balanced out by the lower demand for food, which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and <a href="Popular_revolt_in_late_medieval_Europe" title="wikilink">popular uprisings</a> broke out across Europe.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Among the uprisings were the <em><a href="jacquerie" class="uri" title="wikilink">jacquerie</a></em> in France, the <a href="Peasants&#39;_Revolt" title="wikilink">Peasants' Revolt</a> in England, and revolts in the cities of <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a> in Italy and <a href="Ghent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghent</a> and <a href="Bruges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bruges</a> in Flanders.

<p>Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the <a href="trivium_(education)" title="wikilink">trivium</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; grammar, rhetoric, logic &lt;U+2013&gt; were studied in either cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread also, with some towns in Italy having more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. The rise of vernacular literature increased in pace, with <a href="Dante" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dante</a>, <a href="Petrarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrarch</a> and <a href="Giovanni_Boccaccio" title="wikilink">Giovanni Boccaccio</a> in 14th century Italy, <a href="Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> and <a href="William_Langland" title="wikilink">William Langland</a> in England, and <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Villon" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Villon</a> and <a href="Christine_de_Pizan" title="wikilink">Christine de Pizan</a> in France. Literature remained mainly religious in character, but although much of this continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages. Theatre also developed in the guise of <a href="miracle_plays" title="wikilink">miracle plays</a> put on by the Church.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> At the end of the period, the development of the <a href="printing_press" title="wikilink">printing press</a> around 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

These objects also included the <a href="Hispano-Moresque_ware" title="wikilink">Hispano-Moresque ware</a> produced by mostly <a href="Mud&lt;U+00E9&gt;jar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mud&lt;U+00E9&gt;jar</a> potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the <a href="Royal_Gold_Cup" title="wikilink">Royal Gold Cup</a>.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders <a href="tapestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">tapestry</a> weaving of sets like <em><a href="The_Lady_and_the_Unicorn" title="wikilink">The Lady and the Unicorn</a></em> became a major luxury industry.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>
<p>The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the <a href="Pulpit_by_Giovanni_Pisano_in_Sant&#39;Andrea,_Pistoia" title="wikilink">Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea</a>. Painted or carved wooden relief <a href="altarpiece" title="wikilink">altarpieces</a> became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. <a href="Early_Netherlandish_painting" title="wikilink">Early Netherlandish painting</a> with artists such as <a href="Jan_van_Eyck" title="wikilink">Jan van Eyck</a> (d. 1441) and <a href="Rogier_van_der_Weyden" title="wikilink">Rogier van der Weyden</a> (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive, and there were around 30,000 different editions of <a href="incunabula" class="uri" title="wikilink">incunabula</a> printed by 1500,<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> and by then illuminated manuscripts were only commissioned by royalty and a few others. Very small <a href="woodcut" title="wikilink">woodcuts</a>, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century, with more expensive <a href="engraving" title="wikilink">engravings</a> supplying a wealthier market with a variety of images.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>

<p>The medieval period is frequently caricatured as supposedly a &quot;time of ignorance and superstition&quot; which placed &quot;the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity.&quot;<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Enlightenment, when scholars contrasted their intellectual cultures with the medieval period, with a negative attitude toward the Middle Ages. Renaissance scholars saw the Classical world as a time of high culture and civilization, and saw the Middle Ages as a decline from that culture. Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a></p>
<p>Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian <a href="Edward_Grant" title="wikilink">Edward Grant</a> writes, &quot;If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century] , they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities&quot;.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Also, contrary to common belief, <a href="David_C._Lindberg" title="wikilink">David Lindberg</a> writes, &quot;the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led&quot;.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
<p>The caricature of the period is also reflected in a number of more specific notions. For instance, a claim that was first propagated in the 19th century<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> and is still very common in popular culture is the supposition that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the <a href="Myth_of_the_flat_earth" title="wikilink">Earth was flat</a>. This claim is mistaken.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> In fact, lecturers in the <a href="medieval_universities" title="wikilink">medieval universities</a> commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Lindberg and Numbers write: &quot;There was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference&quot;.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
