<p><strong>Magnus, Robot Fighter</strong> is a fictional character created by writer/artist <a href="Russ_Manning" title="wikilink">Russ Manning</a> in 1963, based primarily on <a href="Tarzan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tarzan</a>. Magnus first appeared in <em>Magnus Robot Fighter 4000 A.D.</em> #1, published by <a href="Gold_Key_Comics" title="wikilink">Gold Key Comics</a> in February 1963. The character was subsequently published by <a href="Valiant_Comics" title="wikilink">Valiant Comics</a> and <a href="Acclaim_Comics" title="wikilink">Acclaim Comics</a> in the 1990s. In every incarnation, Magnus was a human who battled rogue robots in the year 4000. While the concept remained the same throughout the years, the way it was approached changed depending on the publisher.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>By the year 4000, humanity has become dependent on robots. This allowed one robot, H8, damaged in a radiation accident, the polrob chief of the civic sector of North Am, to promote this dependency, and gradually impose totalitarian rule in the area under its control.</p>
<p>Magnus was raised by a robot known as 1A, a name which implies that he was the very first robot of his type ever manufactured. 1A seemed to be <a href="self-aware" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-aware</a> and possess <a href="emotions" class="uri" title="wikilink">emotions</a>. A firm believer in the <a href="Three_Laws_of_Robotics" title="wikilink">Three Laws of Robotics</a>, 1A recognized the threat represented by the dependency of humans on robots in general, and the developments in North Am due to H8 in particular. Therefore, 1A trained Magnus as a warrior to protect humans against both rogue robots, and humans who used normal robots for evil purposes. Magnus was trained by infancy by 1A, using advanced techniques, to become a skilled <a href="martial_arts" title="wikilink">martial artist</a> who could break steel with his bare hands. In addition, 1A equipped his charge with a device that would allow him to &quot;hear&quot; robot-to-robot radio communications.</p>
<p>Magnus' girlfriend was named Leeja. Robots that served as police were called &quot;polrobs&quot; (as in police robots); they were painted black and white like city police cars. All robots had identifying numbers painted on their chest and backs. Other robots, such as taxi drivers, could be nothing more than a torso with arms and head attached to a flying automobile.</p>
<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
<p>Both the Gold Key and Valiant versions take place in <a href="North_Am" title="wikilink">North Am</a>, a gigantic megalopolis that encompassed the entire North American continent. The city consists of several &quot;levels.&quot; The higher levels are populated by wealthier individuals, often regarded as &quot;soft&quot; and complacent. The lowest level, the Goph Level, is populated by a hardier and less educated class known as &quot;gophs.&quot;</p>
<p>By AD 4000, the nation of <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> is home to 50 billion people. The major islands of Japan are covered by a single, contiguous structure known as the Host. Grandmother, a <a href="Freewill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freewill</a> electronic network, controls virtually every facet of daily life.</p>
<p>Aside from North Am, Earth also features a city on the continent on <a href="Antarctica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antarctica</a> named Antarcto. The city consists of several transparent domes, inside each of which the climate is carefully controlled. Construction of these habitats was fiercely opposed, for fear of ecological damage to the fragile Antarctic system. As well, there is the area known as Himalhina, which apparently includes at least all of <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>.</p>

<h3 id="original-series">Original series</h3>
<p>The original series, titled <em>Magnus, Robot Fighter, 4000 AD</em>, premiered in 1963. It was written and drawn by <a href="Russ_Manning" title="wikilink">Russ Manning</a>. For the duration of the title's original run, Magnus battled rogue robots, aliens, space pirates and other threats. He fell in love with Leeja Clane, the daughter of one of North Am's senators. Leeja developed limited <a href="telepathic" class="uri" title="wikilink">telepathic</a> abilities after training by M'Ree and other humans who had acquired them as a result of their minds being linked together while imprisioned in suspended animation by H8. The series was popular in the 1960s. As the '70s approached, sales began to decline. The last issue (#46) was published in January 1977. However, Manning only completed 21 issues; the rest were reprints of previous issues or new stories by others (#23-28). The inferior quality of the non-Manning stories was the main reason for the decline of popularity.</p>
<p>The original concept is a deliberate inversion or update of the <a href="Tarzan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tarzan</a> mythos, the syndicated comic strip of which Russ Manning had previously illustrated. Where Tarzan was a human raised as a <em>noble savage</em> feral child by African <a href="great_apes" title="wikilink">great apes</a> who brought his naturalistic worldview and opposition to runaway commercial industry to bear against a decadent and rapacious human civilization consumed by its own sense of manifest destiny, Magnus was a human raised as an <em>ethical scientist</em> raised by an Antarctican <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a> who brought his individualistic worldview and opposition to runaway technological conformity to bear against an even more decadent and complacent human civilization doomed by its own hedonistic self-absorption. In both cases, the hero is a throwback to a hardier and more naturalistic time, presumed to be purer and closer to his better nature than the rest of humanity, who seeks to share his <a href="spirituality" class="uri" title="wikilink">spirituality</a> and belief in the natural world with a world blinded by crass <a href="materialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">materialism</a> and now endangered by its own material success.</p>
<h3 id="backup-series">Backup series</h3>
<p>In the early '80s, a new Magnus <a href="backup_series" title="wikilink">backup series</a> ran in the new <a href="Solar_(comics)" title="wikilink">Doctor Solar</a> title in issues #29&lt;U+2013&gt;31. This was supposed to lead to a new Magnus title, but GK stopped publication soon afterwards. Supposedly, there was work completed for 2 new Magnus issues (what would be <em>Magnus</em> #47, 48), but have never been published. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1991, <a href="Jim_Shooter" title="wikilink">Jim Shooter</a> obtained rights to three Gold Key characters: <em><a href="Solar_(comics)" title="wikilink">Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom</a></em>; <em><a href="Turok" title="wikilink">Turok, Son of Stone</a></em>; and <em>Magnus, Robot Fighter</em>. He intended to use those characters to launch his new comic book line, Valiant Comics. Several months later, the company launched <em>Magnus, Robot Fighter</em>.</p>
<p>The series began where the original one left off. The artists took great care to replicate the setting and trappings of the original stories. But as the new series progressed, it began to deviate from the original concept. The term &quot;Freewills&quot; appeared in the Valiant run, introducing the concept that the rogue robots seen previously were not simply the product of random malfunctions, but were the result of a common phenomenon which allowed robots to become sentient. While some of them were malevolent, others merely wanted to be free. It was also learned that 1A was also a freewill. With Magnus' help, a colony of benevolent Freewills was established called the &quot;Steel Nation.&quot; At the same time, Magnus became disgusted with North Am's elite. He journeyed to the lower levels of North Am and befriended a group of social outcasts known as Gophs.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, it was used to introduce other heroes to the Valiant Universe. In issue #5, a <a href="Japanese_people" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> hero known as <a href="Rai_(comics)" title="wikilink">Rai</a> began appearing in Magnus' title, and would eventually move on into his own series. In the sixth issue, the future version of Solar made his debut. The issue also introduced the <a href="spider_aliens" title="wikilink">spider aliens</a>, who became a recurring threat throughout the Valiant Universe. In the 12th issue, modern readers were reintroduced to Turok, Son of Stone.</p>
<h3 id="unity">Unity</h3>
<p>During the <a href="Unity_(Comics)" title="wikilink">Unity</a> <a href="fictional_crossover" title="wikilink">crossover</a>, it was revealed that Magnus was actually born during the Unity conflict. He was a child of a <a href="Harbingers_(comics)" title="wikilink">harbinger</a> named Torque and a woman named Kris Hathaway. <a href="Geomancers_(comics)" title="wikilink">Geomancer</a> <a href="Geoff_McHenry_(Valiant_Comics)" title="wikilink">Geoff McHenry</a> sensed that someone like Magnus was needed in the future, so Solar transported the baby Magnus to the future, where he was picked up by the Solar from that time period and delivered to 1A. It was also revealed that Magnus' strength wasn't solely due to his martial arts training: rather, it was a harbinger ability inherited from his father.</p>
<h3 id="the-malev-war">The Malev War</h3>
<p>Shortly after the Unity crossover, the future Earth was invaded by alien robots called Malevs directed by the giant brain, introduced in the original series, that encompassed the planet of Malev 6. This invasion forced all of the future heroes to band together. Their adventures were showcased in a spin-off title, <em><a href="Rai_(comics)" title="wikilink">Rai and the Future Force</a></em>.</p>
<p>After the Malev War ended, all future titles jumped twenty years forward. Magnus became the leader of North Am. He married Leeja (his love interest since the original series) and had a son, whom he named Torque. Magnus spent the rest of the series battling various threats. During the <a href="Chaos_Effect" title="wikilink">Chaos Effect</a> crossover, he was transported to the 20th century, but he eventually returned to the future.</p>

<h2 id="deathmate"><em>Deathmate</em></h2>
<p><em><a href="Deathmate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deathmate</a></em> was a joint publication by both Valiant Comics and <a href="Image_Comics" title="wikilink">Image Comics</a>. In this continuity, Magnus was given the name &quot;Chris Torkelson&quot; and was a child raised and trained by Battlestone, who was working for the <a href="Harbinger_Foundation" title="wikilink">Harbinger Foundation</a>. In this series, Magnus's parents were both killed by Battlestone while trying to escape the Harbinger Foundation. Years later, Magnus would confront Battlestone about this, and fight him to more-or-less a standstill, while Geoff McHenry, the Geomancer of Earth, would lament that reality is literally coming to an end around them. The world ends as Magnus and Battlestone fight to the death.</p>
<h2 id="acclaim-comics">Acclaim Comics</h2>
<p>In 1995, Voyager Communications, the company that owned Valiant Comics, was bought by <a href="Acclaim_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Acclaim Entertainment</a>. At first, it continued publishing Valiant Comics titles, but sales began to plummet after the <a href="direct_market_crash" title="wikilink">direct market crash</a> and the comics division was shut down. <em>Magnus, Robot Fighter</em> was one of the last titles to be canceled.</p>
<p>In 1997, Acclaim Entertainment relaunched its comic book division. All Valiant Comics characters were altered and <a href="reboot_(continuity)" title="wikilink">rebooted</a>, including Magnus. This time, Magnus was re-imagined as an insane robot fighter who, in addition to the original's strength and skills, had metallic blood that repaired his injuries. The series was much more comedic and self-parodying then any of the previous incarnations.</p>
<p>Two years later, Acclaim Comics closed, and Magnus' title was one of the first to go, along with most of the line.</p>
<h3 id="unity-2000">Unity 2000</h3>
<p>In 1999, Acclaim Entertainment made a final attempt to revive its comic book line, and Jim Shooter was invited to write a Unity 2000 crossover. Due to financial troubles within the company, only three issues of six were published. The Valiant version of Magnus played an important role in the crossover, while the Acclaim version was a background player.</p>
<h2 id="later-status">Later status</h2>
<p>In 2002, the rights to Magnus, Robot Fighter reverted to <a href="Random_House" title="wikilink">Random House</a>, which, at that point, acquired <a href="Western_Publishing" title="wikilink">Western Publishing</a>'s assets. It made a contract with <a href="Dark_Horse_Comics" title="wikilink">Dark Horse Comics</a> to reprint the original series.</p>
