<ul>
<li>The end of episode three states that Albert Blithe never recovered from the wounds he received in Normandy, and that he died in 1948. However, Albert Blithe did not die until 1967, after having two children, working for <a href="Westinghouse_Electric" title="wikilink">Westinghouse Electric</a>, serving in the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a> and achieving the rank of <a href="Master_Sergeant" title="wikilink">Master Sergeant</a>. He was buried in <a href="Arlington_National_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Arlington National Cemetery</a> with full military honors. <a href="http://www.kramerg.com/tircuit/bandofbrothers/messages/135/879.html?1090323534">1</a></li>

<li>In preparation for <a href="Operation_Market_Garden" title="wikilink">Operation Market Garden</a>, Sergeant &quot;Bull&quot; Randleman tells a new soldier to &quot;drop your reserve chute &lt;U+2014&gt; you won't need it &lt;U+2014&gt; we'll be jumping low.&quot; This is incorrect for Market Garden, but had been correct for Normandy: on D-Day most troops jumped at 600 feet or less (200 m) &lt;U+2014&gt; barely enough for the main chute to deploy. &quot;The Market-Garden drop was a high drop, with average exits from 1,200 to 1,500 feet.&quot;<a href="http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers5.html">2</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of Episode 9 it is stated that the date is <a href="April_11" title="wikilink">April 11</a> 1945 and shows a scene with the company stationed in Thalem, Germany. At the end of the episode it finishes off the scene with Captain Nixon announcing the death of <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>. Hitler did not die until the <a href="April_30" title="wikilink">April 30</a> 1945. Also, the episode frames this after the company left Landsberg. The company was present at Landsberg from <a href="April_25" title="wikilink">April 25</a> until <a href="April_30" title="wikilink">April 30</a>, and orders given in that same scene to advance on <a href="Berchtesgaden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berchtesgaden</a> were not received until <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a>. <a href="http://www.506infantry.org/officialDocuments/official.html">3</a> (<em>Disputed below</em>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Due to the miniseries only casting a limited portion of the Easy Company roster, certain roles had to be changed from their historical counterparts. For example, in the last patrol at Hagenau, the book cites Sergeant Mercier as the leading <a href="non-commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">NCO</a> with 2LT Jones as ranking officer. As Mercier was not cast in the miniseries, the position was filled by Sergeant Martin (<a href="Dexter_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Dexter Fletcher</a>).</li>
