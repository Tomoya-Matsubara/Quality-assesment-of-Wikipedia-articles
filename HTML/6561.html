<p><strong>Erast Petrovich Fandorin</strong> () is a fictional 19th-century Russian <a href="detective" class="uri" title="wikilink">detective</a> and the hero of a series of Russian historical detective novels by <a href="Boris_Akunin" title="wikilink">Boris Akunin</a>. The first novel was published in Russia in 1998, and the latest was published in December 2009.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> More than 15 million copies of Fandorin novels have been sold as of May 2006,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> even though the novels were freely available from many Russian web-sites and the hard-copies were relatively expensive by Russian standards.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> New books in the Fandorin series typically sell over 200,000 copies in the first week alone,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> with an unparalleled (for mystery novels) first edition of 50,000 copies for the first books to 500,000 copies for the last.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In Russia, the Fandorin series rivals <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> or <em><a href="Harry_Potter" title="wikilink">Harry Potter</a></em> in popularity.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The English translations of the novels have been critically acclaimed by, among others, <a href="Ruth_Rendell" title="wikilink">Ruth Rendell</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="concept-of-the-series">Concept of the series</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, detective novels enjoyed mass popularity. Although they were seen as a &quot;low genre&quot; by the communist officials, both local (such as Vayner brothers and <a href="Julian_Semenov" title="wikilink">Julian Semenov</a>), and foreign detective novels have always been avidly coveted.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many trashy detective novels were published that featured a lot of gore and sex.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Akunin's wife, in common with many other Russians,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> started to enjoy reading this genre of literature. However, she did not want to be seen reading the novels and she always wrapped them in brown paper to prevent people from seeing what she was reading.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This inspired Akunin to create a detective novel which nobody would be ashamed to be caught reading,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> something between the literature of <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a> and <a href="Fyodor_Dostoevsky" title="wikilink">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> and the pulp of modern Russian detective novels.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>He set out to write a cycle about Fandorin with an exploration of every subgenre of the detective novel in mind, from spies to serial killers.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In addition, he wanted to address different types of human character in his books. As Akunin identified sixteen subgenres of crime novels, as well as sixteen character types, the novels in the Erast Fandorin series will ultimately number sixteen. As of December 2009, thirteen novels have been published in Russia. The series is titled <em></em> (<em>New detective</em>, or <em>New Mystery</em>). This title serves to set the novels apart from the postmodernist intellectual novels as well as from the trashy detective novels,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but it is also a subtle play on the use of time in the novels.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Akunin uses many historical settings for his novels. He uses the <a href="Russo-Turkish_War,_1877-1878" title="wikilink">war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire</a> as background for the novel <em>The Turkish Gambit</em>; the death of the &quot;White General&quot; <a href="Mikhail_Skobelev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Skobelev</a> (as 'Mikhail Sobolev') in <em>The Death of Achilles</em>; and the coronation of Tsar <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Nicholas II</a> and the <a href="Khodynka_Tragedy" title="wikilink">Khodynka Tragedy</a> for <em>Coronation, or the Last of the Romanovs</em>. Akunin uses the gaps in the knowledge of these histories to create an atmosphere for his mystery novels to which readers can relate.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<h3 id="biography-and-career">Biography and career</h3>
<p>Akunin describes in <a href="The_Winter_Queen_(novel)" title="wikilink"><em>The Winter Queen</em></a> how Erast Fandorin was orphaned at the age of nineteen. He never knew his mother, and his father died bankrupt, leaving only debts. Fandorin had to abandon his education at Moscow University and was forced to enter the police force as a clerk. Since the events in <em>The Winter Queen</em> take place in the spring of 1876 (when Akunin says Fandorin is twenty), this places his birth some time in the year 1856. Further hints at Fandorin's ancestry are given in another novel, <em>Altyn Tolobas</em>, one of four novels set in the present day and featuring Fandorin's grandson Nicholas, where Akunin writes of how Captain Cornelius von Dorn, a <a href="Germans" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="hussar" class="uri" title="wikilink">hussar</a>, entered Russia in ca. 1680. Erast Fandorin represents the 8th generation counting from Cornelius, the German name <em>von Dorn</em> having been Russified to <em>Fandorin</em> in the 18th century.</p>
<p>In <em>The Winter Queen</em>, Fandorin falls in love with a seventeen-year-old girl, Elizaveta, whom he meets while he is investigating his first case. On their wedding day, she was killed by a bomb in a package addressed to Fandorin himself. At the time of the explosion, Fandorin was out pursuing the person who delivered the bomb and thus miraculously escaped without physical harm. The trauma of losing his bride leads to a lifelong slight stammer in Fandorin and a premature greyness at the temples.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="The_Turkish_Gambit" title="wikilink">The Turkish Gambit</a></em>, Fandorin is charged with the capture of a Turkish spy during the <a href="Russo-Turkish_War,_1877-1878" title="wikilink">war</a> between Russia and the <a href="Ottoman_empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman empire</a>. Upon his return, he requests to be stationed in a remote post, and becomes second secretary to the Russian ambassador in Japan. His adventures in Japan are detailed in the second part of <em><a href="The_Diamond_Chariot" title="wikilink">The Diamond Chariot</a></em> and in <em>Jade Rosary Beads</em>. In Japan, he saves the life of the fallen <a href="yakuza" class="uri" title="wikilink">yakuza</a> Masa, who becomes his manservant as a token of gratitude. He learns martial arts, including <a href="ninjutsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">ninjutsu</a>, and trains in them every day with Masa. In <em><a href="The_Death_of_Achilles" title="wikilink">The Death of Achilles</a></em> Akunin describes how Fandorin returns to Russia, only to find his old friend General <a href="Mikhail_Skobelev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Sobolev</a> murdered. Fandorin enters the service of The Governor-General of Moscow, <a href="Knyaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knyaz</a> Dolgoruki (a fictionalized version of <a href="Vladimir_Dolgorukov" title="wikilink">Vladimir Dolgorukov</a>).</p>
<p>Fandorin rises from the rank of Collegiate Registrar to that of Collegiate Counsellor over the years 1876 to 1891 (ranks XIV and VI in the <a href="Table_of_Ranks" title="wikilink">Table of Ranks</a>, respectively).</p>
<p>In <em><a href="The_State_Counsellor" title="wikilink">The State Counsellor</a></em>, set in 1891, Fandorin is accused of the attempted murder of the Governor of Moscow. After he clears his name, Fandorin is offered the job of <em><a href="&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;-&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0446&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0439&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0439&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;" title="wikilink">Oberpolizeimeister</a></em> but declines, instead resigning from public service and becoming a private investigator. He then leaves for America, studying engineering at <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">M.I.T.</a>, in 1895, as told in <em>Jade Rosary Beads</em>. In <em><a href="The_Coronation_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Coronation</a></em>, Fandorin returns to Russia in time to prevent an international scandal from occurring during the coronation of <a href="Tsar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Nicholas II of Russia</a> in 1896. In 1905, Fandorin protects the <a href="Trans-Siberian_Railway" title="wikilink">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> from Japanese saboteurs during the <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a>.</p>
<p>Allusions to the fate of Fandorin are made in <em>Altyn Tolobas</em>. Late in life Fandorin marries again and has at least one son, Alexander, who is born in exile in London in 1920, his mother having left Russia in 1919 while pregnant, which implies that Erast Fandorin died in that year in the turmoils of the <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a>. Alexander's son, Nicholas Fandorin, is born around 1960.</p>
<h3 id="physical-appearance-and-other-characteristics">Physical appearance and other characteristics</h3>
<p>Boris Akunin provides the reader with a vivid portrait of Erast Fandorin. Fandorin is of average height, with a thin build. He has a small moustache, blue eyes and black hair. The death of his wife caused his hair to turn grey at the <a href="temple_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">temples</a> almost overnight, as described in <em>The Winter Queen</em>. It also caused him to stammer, but this tends to diminish as tensions rise. Fandorin is always impeccably groomed and can be vain about his appearance; in <em>The Winter Queen</em> he wears a corset to improve his figure. He is a gifted linguist; in various novels he speaks English, French, German and Japanese with fluency, as well as a working knowledge of both Serbian and Turkish in <em>The Turkish Gambit</em>.</p>
<p>In every novel, Fandorin is described as a master of disguise, which he uses to infiltrate criminal hideouts and in stakeouts. When he is disguised, he does not stammer at all. In <em>The Coronation</em>, Fandorin explains that this is because he always takes on the personality of the disguise, which often requires that he should not stammer. In <em>The Winter Queen</em>, he learns to present evidence by making a list: &quot;That is one. That is two. And that is three&quot;. He is brave and determined, and has to kill several men during his investigative career, but he is still sickened by the sight of blood. While in Japan, he learns the art of the <a href="ninja" title="wikilink">ninjas</a> (or &quot;silent ones&quot;, as they are referred to in the novels). He is physically fit and athletic. In his later years, Fandorin becomes an enthusiast of the newly invented automobile.</p>
<p>Fandorin is exceptionally lucky, a common trait in the Fandorin family that skips every other generation; allusions to this character trait appear in every novel. He never loses a bet, and wins at all sports. He has however lost the appetite for gambling, as it soon became boring. He can be popular with the opposite sex, partly because he still mourns the loss of his first wife - this sadness seems to attract women.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="allusions-and-references-to-other-works">Allusions and references to other works</h2>
<p>According to Akunin, he mixed several of the most sympathetic heroes of Russian literature to form the Erast Fandorin character.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> One of these heroes is Chatsky from <a href="Alexander_Griboyedov" title="wikilink">Alexander Griboyedov</a>'s <em><a href="Woe_from_Wit" title="wikilink">Woe from Wit</a></em>, from whom Fandorin inherits his sense of duty: &quot;To serve the cause, not the individuals&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Other heroes Erast Fandorin is based upon are Andrei Bolkonski (from <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a>'s <em><a href="War_and_Peace" title="wikilink">War and Peace</a></em>), <a href="Prince_Myshkin" title="wikilink">Prince Myshkin</a> (from <a href="Fyodor_Dostoevsky" title="wikilink">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>'s <em><a href="The_Idiot_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Idiot</a></em>) and <a href="Pechorin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pechorin</a> (from <a href="Mikhail_Lermontov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Lermontov</a>'s <em><a href="A_Hero_of_Our_Time" title="wikilink">A Hero of Our Time</a></em>).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Akunin said he &quot;plots along the line of <a href="Kazuo_Ishiguro" title="wikilink">Kazuo Ishiguro</a>'s <em><a href="Remains_of_the_Day" title="wikilink">Remains of the Day</a></em>&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The orphaned urchin Senka, the narrator of <em><a href="The_Lover_of_Death" title="wikilink">The Lover of Death</a></em>, is clearly based upon <em><a href="Oliver_Twist" title="wikilink">Oliver Twist</a></em> (also pointed out by the subtitle of that novel: a <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Dickensian</a> story).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The entire first volume of <em><a href="The_Diamond_Chariot" title="wikilink">The Diamond Chariot</a></em> is an allusion to <a href="Alexander_Kuprin" title="wikilink">Alexander Kuprin</a>'s <em><a href="Junior_Captain_Rybnikov" title="wikilink">Junior Captain Rybnikov</a></em>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and the opening sentence of <em><a href="The_Winter_Queen_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Winter Queen</a></em> is a clear reference to <a href="Mikhail_Bulgakov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Bulgakov</a>'s <em><a href="The_Master_and_Margarita" title="wikilink">The Master and Margarita</a></em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A more subtle allusion exists to <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a>'s <em><a href="Anna_Karenina" title="wikilink">Anna Karenina</a></em>, as the novel <em>The Winter Queen</em> starts with a suicide in 1876, exactly the same year in which Anna throws herself under a train.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Another allusion to Anna Karenina can be found in <em>The Jack of Spades</em>, where Fandorin's current girlfriend, who is married to another man, has the same <a href="patronymic" class="uri" title="wikilink">patronymic</a> (Arkadievna) as Anna Karenina herself. In <em><a href="Murder_on_the_Leviathan" title="wikilink">Murder on the Leviathan</a></em>, one of the newspaper fragments is signed by G. du Roy, an allusion to the journalist Georges Duroy from <a href="Guy_de_Maupassant" title="wikilink">Guy de Maupassant</a>'s <em><a href="Bel_Ami" title="wikilink">Bel Ami</a></em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em><a href="The_Death_of_Achilles" title="wikilink">The Death of Achilles</a></em> the hired killer Achimas is mentioned as having been secretly hired by the Italian government to kill an anarchist nicknamed &quot;The Jackal&quot; who plans to kill King <a href="Umberto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Umberto</a> - yet Achimas himself bears considerable similarity to the hired killer nicknamed &quot;The Jackal&quot; who plans to kill <a href="Charles_de_Gaulle" title="wikilink">Charles de Gaulle</a> in <a href="Frederick_Forsyth" title="wikilink">Frederick Forsyth</a>'s &quot;<a href="The_Day_of_the_Jackal" title="wikilink">The Day of the Jackal</a>&quot;. Furthermore, Achimas' lifestory mirrors that of the <em><a href="Iliad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iliad</a>'s</em> <a href="Achilles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Achilles</a> and the events described in the second part of the novel allude to <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s work.</p>

<p>Akunin's stated goal in creating the Fandorin series was to try as many approaches to <a href="detective_fiction" title="wikilink">detective fiction</a> as possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-winter-queen">The Winter Queen</h3>

<p>Moscow, 1876. The 20-year-old Erast Fandorin, recently <a href="orphan" title="wikilink">orphaned</a>, enters civil service as a clerk in the Criminal Investigations Department of the Moscow Police. While investigating a scandalous but, seemingly, quite straightforward case of public suicide by a rich young man, Fandorin uncovers a powerful and terrible conspiracy.</p>
<h3 id="the-turkish-gambit">The Turkish Gambit</h3>

<p><a href="Pleven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pleven</a>, 1877. During the <a href="Russo-Turkish_War,_1877&lt;U+2013&gt;1878" title="wikilink">Russo-Turkish war of 1877</a>, an encrypted message is mysteriously altered, leading to strategic gains by the Turks. Fandorin, an agent of the <a href="Third_Section" title="wikilink">Third Section</a> (Russia's secret police), is ordered to find the Turkish spy before more damage to the Russian cause is done.</p>
<h3 id="murder-on-the-leviathan">Murder on the Leviathan</h3>

<p><a href="Red_Sea" title="wikilink">Red Sea</a>, 1878. A terrible mass murder is committed in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and clues lead &quot;Papa&quot; Gauche, a French police inspector on board the British <a href="steamship" class="uri" title="wikilink">steamship</a> <em>Leviathan</em>, sailing from <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a> to <a href="Calcutta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a>. Fandorin, now a diplomat newly appointed to a post in Japan, is one of the passengers. Will Gauche's experience and Fandorin's talents be enough to uncover the killer?</p>
<h3 id="the-death-of-achilles">The Death of Achilles</h3>

<p><a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, 1882. After four years of diplomatic service in Japan, Fandorin returns to Moscow with his Japanese manservant Masa. He arrives just in time to hear about the premature death of war hero Mikhail Sobolev, who apparently suffered heart failure in his hotel room. Fandorin, who has just assumed the post of the Governor-General's Deputy for Special Assignments, is very suspicious of the circumstances of Sobolev's death. Before long, his investigation will lead him to another quite extraordinary man.</p>
<h3 id="special-assignments">Special Assignments</h3>

<p><em>Special Assignments</em> (Russian: &lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; &lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt;) is a single volume containing two different <a href="novella" title="wikilink">novellas</a>, <em>The Jack of Spades</em> (Russian: &lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0439&gt; &lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;) and <em>The Decorator</em> (Russian: &lt;U+0414&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;). They both deal with Fandorin's service as the Deputy for Special Assignments (hence the name) for the Moscow Governor-General Prince Dolgorukoi. In &quot;The Jack of Spades&quot;, set in 1886 Moscow, Fandorin and his assistant Tulipov pursue a crafty <a href="confidence_trick" title="wikilink">con man</a> who has successfully tricked the Governor-General himself.

When a wealthy man dies, Fandorin is brought in to clarify some points of the will. After the murder of several characters, Fandorin (assisted by his manservant Masa) needs his sleuthing skills once more. The black version leads to a diametrically opposed result to that of the white version, due to some minor changes in evidence found in the beginning of the play. This play is notable for the comic element introduced by Masa's limited knowledge of Russian&lt;U+2014&gt;he has begun copying out words from the dictionary but so far has gotten only to the letter &quot;D&quot;.
