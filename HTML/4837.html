<p>The <strong><em>Ormulum</em></strong> or <strong><em>Orrmulum</em></strong> is a twelfth-century work of Biblical <a href="exegesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">exegesis</a>, written in early <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> verse by a monk named Orm (or Ormin). Because of the unique <a href="phonetics" title="wikilink">phonetic</a> <a href="orthography" class="uri" title="wikilink">orthography</a> adopted by its author, the work preserves many details of English pronunciation existing at a time when the language was in flux after the <a href="Norman_Conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a>. Consequently, it is invaluable to <a href="philology" title="wikilink">philologists</a> in tracing the development of the language.</p>
<p>Orm was concerned with priests' ability to speak the <a href="vernacular" class="uri" title="wikilink">vernacular</a>, and developed an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict poetic meter to ensure that readers know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Unusually for work of the period, the <em>Ormulum</em> is neither anonymous nor untitled. The author names himself at the end of the dedication:</p>

named Ormin by name |<br />
<small>(Ded. 323&lt;U+2013&gt;324)</small> |} At the start of the preface, the author identifies himself again, using a different spelling of his name, and gives the work a title:</p>

<small>(Pref. 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2)</small> |}</p>
<p>The name &quot;Orm&quot; is derived from <a href="Old_Norse_language" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a>, meaning <em>worm</em> or <em>dragon</em>. With the suffix of &quot;myn&quot; for &quot;man&quot; (hence &quot;Ormin&quot;), it was a common name throughout the <a href="Danelaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danelaw</a> area of England. The choice between the two forms of the name probably was dictated by the meter at each use. The title of the poem, &quot;Ormulum&quot;, is modeled after the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> word, <em>speculum</em> (&quot;mirror&quot;) and it may be interpreted as either the boastful &quot;Reflection of Orm,&quot; or the modest &quot;Researches of Orm.&quot;</p>
<p>The Danish name is not unexpected; the language of the <em>Ormulum</em>, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the <a href="Danelaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danelaw</a>. It includes numerous <a href="Old_Norse_language" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few <a href="Old_French" title="wikilink">Old French</a> influences on Orm's language.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Another &lt;U+2014&gt; likely previous &lt;U+2014&gt; East Midlands work, the <em><a href="Peterborough_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Peterborough Chronicle</a></em>, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English.</p>
<p><img src="BourneAbbeyInterior.jpg" title="fig:The interior of the church of Bourne Abbey, where the Ormulum was composed: the two nave arcades, although now whitewashed, remain from the church Orm would have known" alt="The interior of the church of Bourne Abbey, where the Ormulum was composed: the two nave arcades, although now whitewashed, remain from the church Orm would have known" /> According to the work's preface, Orm wrote it at the behest of <em>Brother Walter</em>, who was his brother both <em>affterr &lt;U+00FE&gt;e fl&lt;U+00E6&gt;shess kinde</em> (biologically) and as a fellow <a href="canon_(priest)" title="wikilink">canon</a> of an <a href="Augustinians" title="wikilink">Augustinian</a> order. With this information, and the evidence of the dialect of the text, it is possible to propose a place of origin with reasonable certainty. While some scholars have held that the likely origin is <a href="Elsham_Priory" title="wikilink">Elsham Priory</a> in north Lincolnshire, it has recently become widely accepted that Orm wrote in the <a href="Arrouaise_(Abbey_and_Order)" title="wikilink">Arrouaisian</a> <a href="Bourne_Abbey" title="wikilink">Bourne Abbey</a>, in <a href="Bourne,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Bourne, Lincolnshire</a>. Two additional pieces of evidence support this conjecture: firstly, the abbey was established by Arrouaisian canons in 1138, and secondly, the work includes dedicatory prayers to <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Peter</a> and <a href="Paul_of_Tarsus" title="wikilink">Paul</a>, who are the patrons of Bourne Abbey.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Arrouaisian rule was largely that of Augustine, so that its houses often are loosely referred to as <a href="Augustinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustinian</a>. The monastic abbey was dissolved in 1536, but its <a href="Church_of_England_parish_church" title="wikilink">parish church</a> function continues.</p>
<p>The date of composition is impossible to pinpoint. Orm wrote his book over a period of decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time. Since it is apparently an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand, a collaborator who entered the <a href="pericope" title="wikilink">pericopes</a> at the head of each homily, it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The text has few topical references to specific events that could be used to identify the period of composition more precisely. Orm may have been an eyewitness to <a href="the_Anarchy" title="wikilink">the Anarchy</a> of the reigns of <a href="Stephen_of_England" title="wikilink">Stephen</a> and <a href="Empress_Matilda" title="wikilink">Matilda</a>, since some have interpreted references to this in some of his admonitions to readers, but if so, he is quite elliptical, as the sermons almost never stray from their source material.</p>
<h2 id="manuscript">Manuscript</h2>
<p>Only one copy of the <em>Ormulum</em> exists, as <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a> <a href="manuscript" title="wikilink">MS</a> Junius 1. In its current state, the manuscript is incomplete: the book's table of contents claims that there were 242 homilies, but only 32 remain. It seems likely that the work was never finished on the scale planned when the table of contents was written, but much of the discrepancy was probably caused by the loss of <a href="Bookbinding" title="wikilink">gatherings</a> from the manuscript. There is no doubt that such losses have occurred even in modern times, as the <a href="Dutch_people" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> antiquarian <a href="Jan_van_Vliet" title="wikilink">Jan van Vliet</a>, one of its seventeenth-century owners, copied out passages that are not in the present text. The amount of redaction in the text, plus the loss of possible gatherings, led <a href="J._A._W._Bennett" title="wikilink">J. A. W. Bennett</a> to comment that &quot;only about one fifth survives, and that in the ugliest of manuscripts&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="parchment" class="uri" title="wikilink">parchment</a> used in the manuscript is of the lowest quality, and the text is written untidily, with an eye to economical use of space; it is laid out in continuous lines like prose, with words and lines close together, and with various additions and corrections, new exegesis, and allegorical readings, crammed into the corners of the margins (as can be seen in the reproduction above). <a href="Robert_W._Burchfield" title="wikilink">Robert W. Burchfield</a> argues that these indications &quot;suggest that it was a 'workshop' draft which the author intended to have recopied by a professional scribe&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems curious that a text so obviously written with the expectation that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect; this implies that a revision or approval process was anticipated, and it is possible that the <em>Ormulum</em> remained in draft form simply because it never left Walter's possession.</p>
<p>The <a href="provenance" class="uri" title="wikilink">provenance</a> of the manuscript before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we know that it was in <a href="Jan_van_Vliet" title="wikilink">van Vliet</a>'s collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by <a href="Franciscus_Junius_(the_younger)" title="wikilink">Franciscus Junius</a>, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="contents-and-style">Contents and style</h2>
<p>The <em>Ormulum</em> consists of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching on each of the texts used in the <a href="mass_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">mass</a> throughout the church calendar. As such, it is the first new <a href="homily" class="uri" title="wikilink">homily</a> cycle in English since the works of <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric_of_Eynsham" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric of Eynsham</a> (c. 990). The motivation was to provide an accessible English text for the benefit of the less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the <a href="Vulgate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vulgate</a> Bible, and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all.</p>
<p>Each homily begins with a paraphrase of a <a href="Gospel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gospel</a> reading (important when the laity did not understand Latin), followed by <a href="exegesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">exegesis</a>. The theological content is derivative; Orm closely follows <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>'s exegesis of <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Luke</a>, the <em>Enarrationes in Matthoei</em>, and the <em><a href="Glossa_ordinaria" title="wikilink">Glossa ordinaria</a></em> of the Bible. Thus, he reads each verse primarily <a href="allegory" title="wikilink">allegorically</a> rather than literally. Rather than identify individual sources, Orm refers frequently to &quot;&lt;U+00F0&gt;e boc&quot; and to the &quot;holy book&quot;. Bennett has speculated that the <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, <em>Glossa Ordinaria</em>, and Bede were bound together in a large <a href="Vulgate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vulgate</a> Bible in the abbey so that Orm truly was getting all of his material from a source that was, to him, a single book .<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the sermons have been deemed &quot;of little literary or theological value&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and though Orm has been said to possess &quot;only one rhetorical device&quot;, that of repetition,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the <em>Ormulum</em> never was intended as a book in the modern sense, but rather as a companion to the <a href="liturgy" class="uri" title="wikilink">liturgy</a>. Priests would read, and congregations hear, only a day's entry at a time. The tedium that many experience when attempting to read the <em>Ormulum</em> today would not exist for persons hearing only a single homily each day. Further, although Orm's poetry is, perhaps, subliterary, the homilies were meant for easy recitation or chanting, not for aesthetic appreciation; everything from the overly strict meter to the orthography might function only to aid <a href="oratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">oratory</a>.</p>
<p>Although earlier metrical homilies, such as those of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric and <a href="Wulfstan_II,_Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Wulfstan</a>, were based on the rules of <a href="Anglo-Saxon_literature" title="wikilink">Old English poetry</a>, they took sufficient liberties with meter to be readable as prose. Orm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a &quot;jog-trot fifteener&quot; for his rhythm (Bennett 31), based on the Latin <a href="iamb" title="wikilink">iambic</a> <em>septenarius</em>, and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry. The work is unusual in that no critic ever has stepped forward to defend it on literary grounds. Indeed, Orm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the meter, &quot;to help those who read it&quot;, and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet.</p>
<p>A brief sample may help to illustrate the style of the work. This passage explains the background to the <a href="Nativity_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Nativity</a>:</p>

<h2 id="orthography">Orthography</h2>
<p>Rather than conspicuous literary merit, the chief scholarly value of the <em>Ormulum</em> derives from Orm's idiosyncratic orthographical system. He states that since he dislikes the way that people are mispronouncing English, he will spell words exactly as they are pronounced, and describes a system whereby vowel length and value are indicated unambiguously.</p>
<p>Orm's chief innovation was to employ doubled consonants to show that the preceding vowel is short and single consonants when the vowel is long. For syllables that ended in vowels, he used accent marks to indicate length. In addition to this, he used two distinct letter forms for <g>, using the old <a href="yogh" class="uri" title="wikilink">yogh</a> for  and , and the new <g> for . His devotion to precise spelling was meticulous; for example, having originally used <eo> and <e> inconsistently for words such as &quot;beon&quot; and &quot;kneow,&quot; which had been spelled with <eo> in <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a>, at line 13,000 he changed his mind and went back to change all &quot;eo&quot; spellings, replacing them solely with &quot;e&quot; alone (&quot;ben&quot; and &quot;knew&quot;), to reflect the pronunciation.</p>
<p>The combination of this system with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation was in no way unusual, this permits scholars to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands in the second half of the twelfth century.</p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>Orm's book has a number of innovations that make it valuable. As Bennett points out, Orm's adaptation of a classical meter with fixed stress patterns anticipates future English poets, who would do much the same when encountering foreign language prosodies. The <em>Ormulum</em> is also the only specimen of the homiletic tradition in England between &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric and the fourteenth century, as well as being the last example of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon_literature" title="wikilink">Old English</a> verse homily. It also demonstrates what would become <a href="Modern_English" title="wikilink">Received Standard English</a> two centuries before <a href="Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="wikilink">Chaucer</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Further, Orm was concerned with the laity. He sought to make the Gospel comprehensible to the congregation, and he did this perhaps forty years before the <a href="Fourth_Council_of_the_Lateran" title="wikilink">Fourth Lateran Council</a> of 1215 &quot;spurred the clergy as a whole into action&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, Orm's idiosyncrasies and attempted orthographic reform make his work vital for understanding Middle English. The <em>Ormulum</em> is, with the <em><a href="Ancrene_Wisse" title="wikilink">Ancrene Wisse</a></em> and the <em><a href="Ayenbite_of_Inwyt" title="wikilink">Ayenbite of Inwyt</a></em>, one of the three crucial texts that have enabled philologists to document the transformation of Old English into Middle English.</p>
