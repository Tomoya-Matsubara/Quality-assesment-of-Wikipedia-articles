<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="early-days">Early days</h3>
<p>King Diamond's first heavy rock band was called Brainstorm (1974&lt;U+2013&gt;76), with Jeanette Blum (Jean Blue) vocal and bass, Michael Frohn (Mike West) guitar and Jes Jacobsen (Jesse James) drums. King Diamond left Brainstorm and began singing with local Danish <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> band <a href="Black_Rose_(band)" title="wikilink">Black Rose</a>. It was during this time in Black Rose that King Diamond began experimenting with horror themed theatrics as well as shaping a malevolent quasi-Satanic stage persona. In 1980, he left Black Rose and joined the <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk</a>-<a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">metal</a> band <a href="Brats_(band)" title="wikilink">Brats</a> where he met <a href="Hank_Shermann" title="wikilink">Hank Shermann</a>. Soon after, the two of them were asked to help <a href="Michael_Denner" title="wikilink">Michael Denner</a> (also formerly a member of Brats) with his own project Danger Zone. This band included <a href="Timi_Hansen" title="wikilink">Timi Hansen</a> and the mentioned musicians would join with King Diamond in 1980 to become <a href="Mercyful_Fate" title="wikilink">Mercyful Fate</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mercyful-fate">Mercyful Fate</h3>

<p>Following Mercyful Fate's 1984 release of <em><a href="Don&#39;t_Break_the_Oath" title="wikilink">Don't Break the Oath</a></em> and the subsequent tour (which saw them play in the U.S. for the first time), King Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate. With him, he took two of his bandmates (Hansen and Denner) to pursue a solo career under his own name.</p>
<p>Mercyful Fate reunited in 1992 (while King Diamond simultaneously continued his solo career) and recorded five more studio albums. In 2000, King decided to put Mercyful Fate on hold and continue on with his solo career. Though Mercyful Fate continues to remain dormant, the band is still under contract with <a href="Metal_Blade_Records" title="wikilink">Metal Blade Records</a>. Also in 1999, King Diamond and Hank Shermann performed the song Mercyful Fate with Metallica live. This performance also has King Diamond without his famous makeup. In recent interviews, King Diamond has stated that Mercyful Fate will record and tour again when the timing is right, saying &quot;It's definitely not finished.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="king-diamond">King Diamond</h3>

<p>In 2001, King Diamond worked out a deal with the band <a href="Usurper_(band)" title="wikilink">Usurper</a> to sing backup vocals on the song &quot;Necronemesis&quot; in exchange for them shifting their recording schedule around to accommodate the recording of <em><a href="Abigail_II:_The_Revenge" title="wikilink">Abigail II: The Revenge</a></em>. In 2004, King Diamond contributed vocals to &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, which was the final track on the album of <a href="Dave_Grohl" title="wikilink">Dave Grohl's</a> heavy metal side project <a href="Probot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Probot</a>. In late 2005, King Diamond appeared on the <em><a href="Roadrunner_United" title="wikilink">Roadrunner United</a> - The All-Star Sessions</em> album, contributing vocals for his song &quot;In the Fire&quot;, which featured multiple Roadrunner Records musicians (past and present) working together to create individual songs. King Diamond also guested on the <a href="Cradle_of_Filth" title="wikilink">Cradle of Filth</a> song &quot;Devil Woman&quot; in late 2005.</p>
<p>In April 2006, King reunited with <a href="Mikkey_Dee" title="wikilink">Mikkey Dee</a> (<a href="Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead</a> drummer) at a sold-out gig at K&lt;U+00E5&gt;ren in <a href="Gothenburg,_Sweden" title="wikilink">Gothenburg, Sweden</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2001 King referred to Dee as &quot;one of the best drummers of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
