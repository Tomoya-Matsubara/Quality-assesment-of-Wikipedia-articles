<p>The <strong>Socialist Left Party</strong> (, ) or <strong>SV</strong>, is a <a href="Norway" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> <a href="left-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> <a href="political_party" title="wikilink">political party</a>. It became the fourth largest political party in Norway for the first time in the <a href="Norwegian_parliamentary_election,_2001" title="wikilink">2001 parliamentary election</a>, and has been so ever since, and at one point being one of the smalles party's in parliament. In 2005, the party managed for the first time to become a governing party, participating in the <a href="Red-Green_Coalition" title="wikilink">Red-Green Coalition</a> with the <a href="Norwegian_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Labour</a> and the <a href="Centre_Party_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Centre Party</a>, before that it was frequently turned down by the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Founded in 1973 as the <em><a href="Socialist_Electoral_League" title="wikilink">Socialist Electoral League</a></em>, an electoral coalition with the <a href="Communist_Party_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Communist Party</a>, <a href="Socialist_People&#39;s_Party_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Socialist People's Party</a>, <a href="Information_Committee_of_the_Labour_Movement_against_Norwegian_membership_in_the_European_Community" title="wikilink">Democratic Socialists &lt;U+2013&gt; AIK</a> and independent socialists; in 1975 the coalition was turned into an electoral party. While currently having the official ideology of <a href="Democratic_socialism" title="wikilink">democratic</a> <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>, the party has also increasingly profiled itself on support for <a href="pro-feminism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pro-feminism</a> and <a href="environmental_policy" title="wikilink">environmental policy</a>, a call for stronger <a href="public_sector" title="wikilink">public sector</a>, more <a href="Mixed_economy" title="wikilink">government involvement in the economy</a> and a strengthening of the <a href="social_welfare" title="wikilink">social welfare</a> net. Since 1997 the moderate faction of the party has held the leading positions.</p>
<p>Currently the party has over 9500 members and is facing the same problem as other major parties in Norway having difficulties with the steady decrease in membership, with the Labour<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the <a href="Progress_Party_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Progress Party</a> being the only parties to experience a steady continuous increase in membership.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The current leader of the Socialist Left is <a href="Kristin_Halvorsen" title="wikilink">Kristin Halvorsen</a>, who has been the party's candidate for <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of Norway</a> since the <a href="Norwegian_parliamentary_election,_2001" title="wikilink">2001 parliamentary election</a>.</p>

<p>The Socialist Left is a left-wing party like both of its predecessors, the <a href="Socialist_People&#39;s_Party_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Socialist People's Party</a> and the <a href="Information_Committee_of_the_Labour_Movement_against_Norwegian_membership_in_the_European_Community" title="wikilink">Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community</a>, which favours the <a href="welfare_state" title="wikilink">welfare state</a> and taxation upon the wealthy.

<p>The party now known as the Socialist Left was founded in 1975.
