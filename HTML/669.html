<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>Since the early 14th century the power of the <a href="Despotate_of_Epirus" title="wikilink">Despotate of Epirus</a> had been decreasing while the Albanian rulers had been increasing their control over many areas of the despotate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Nikephoros_II_Orsini" title="wikilink">Nikephoros II Orsini</a>, Despot of Epirus decided to establish closer relations to the <a href="Serbian_Empire" title="wikilink">Serbian Empire</a> by dropping his previous wife Maria Cantacuzena and marrying the sister of <a href="Stefan_Uro&lt;U+0161&gt;_IV_Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an" title="wikilink">Stefan Uro&lt;U+0161&gt; IV Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an</a>'s widow. The Albanians of the Despotate threatened revolt if Orsini married <a href="Helena_of_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Helena of Bulgaria</a>'s sister and didn't recall Maria, who was part of the Cantacuzene family allied with them.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Orsini was forced to recall Maria but decided to wage war against the Albanians to stop their increasing power in the despotate.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Nikephoros II Orsini gathered his forces and marched against the Albanians in the regions they had settled in <a href="Aetolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aetolia</a>, modern western <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>. The Albanians gathered their forces and under the leadership of <a href="Peter_Losha" title="wikilink">Peter Losha</a> fought against Orsini in the late spring of 1359 near the <a href="Achelous_river" title="wikilink">Achelous river</a>.

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>After Nikephoros's death the remaining major towns in the Despotate Epirus, being under risk of capture by the Albanian troops, submitted to <a href="Simeon_Uro&lt;U+0161&gt;" title="wikilink">Simeon Uro&lt;U+0161&gt;</a> and the remaining areas of the despotate were divided between him and Radoslav Hlapen.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Simeon unable to expel the Albanian leaders tried to maintain indirect control of the Despotate of Epirus by recognizing as Despots of the regions of Arta and Aetolia Peter Losha and Gjin Bua Shpata, who created the <a href="Despotate_of_Arta" title="wikilink">Despotate of Arta</a> and the <a href="Despotate_of_Angelokastron_and_Lepanto" title="wikilink">Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Although most of Epirus was under Albanian rule due to their tribal structure and lack of central authority the Albanians didn't replace any existing Greek or Serbian rule with a centralized Albanian state.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As an aftermath by 1366-7 only the city of <a href="Ioannina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ioannina</a> wasn't under Albanian control.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
