<p><strong><em>Between the Buttons</em></strong> is the fifth British and seventh American studio <a href="album" class="uri" title="wikilink">album</a> by <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>. It was released on 20 January 1967 in the United Kingdom and 11 February 1967 in the United States as the follow-up to the ambitious <em><a href="Aftermath_(The_Rolling_Stones_album)" title="wikilink">Aftermath</a></em>. <em>Between the Buttons</em> is seen as the beginning of the Stone's first complete departure from their R&amp;B roots and the beginning of their brief foray into <a href="psychadelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychadelia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recording-and-background">Recording and background</h2>
<p>Initial sessions for the album began during the Rolling Stone's 1966 American Tour at <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>' RCA Studios on 3 August 1966 and lasted until the 11th. <a href="Dave_Hassinger" title="wikilink">Dave Hassinger</a> was the engineer. During this time several songs were worked on and the backing tracks for six songs that would appear on the album were recorded. Also completed was the backing track for &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot; and the R&amp;B throwback &quot;Who's Driving Your Plane?&quot;, which would appear as a B-side to the somewhat psychedelic &quot;<a href="Have_You_Seen_Your_Mother,_Baby,_Standing_in_the_Shadow?" title="wikilink">Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?</a>&quot; single in late September. The band returned to London where sessions continued at IBC Studios on 31 August and lasted until 3 September. This session was dedicated largely to completing &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother...&quot; for single release. Following the release of that single on 23 September, the Stones embarked on their 7th British tour with lasted into early October 1966. It would be their last UK tour for 3 years.</p>
<p>The second block of recording sessions for <em>Between the Buttons</em> began on 8 November at the newly opened <a href="Olympic_Sound_Studios" title="wikilink">Olympic Sound Studios</a> in <a href="Barnes,_London" title="wikilink">Barnes, London</a> and traveled between there and <a href="Pye_Studios" title="wikilink">Pye Studios</a> until 26 November. During this time the bulk of the album was completed including vocal overdubs of the previously recorded backing tracks, mixing and arranging. &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; was also completed. Around the same time producer <a href="Andrew_Loog_Oldham" title="wikilink">Andrew Loog Oldham</a> was also preparing the US-only live album <em><a href="Got_Live_If_You_Want_It!_(album)" title="wikilink">Got Live If You Want It!</a></em>, a contractual requirement from <a href="London_Records" title="wikilink">London Records</a> which contained live performances from their British tour 2 months prior mixed with studio tracks overdubbed with fake audience noise. After that album's release on 10 December, a final overdubbing session for <em>Buttons</em> was held at Olympic Studio on 13 December 1966 before Oldham took the tapes back to RCA Studios in Hollywood for final mixing and editing.</p>
<p>The entire album was recorded using a <a href="4-track_(multitrack)" title="wikilink">4-track</a> machine in which which was bounced down for overdubs, so much so that Mick Jagger felt the songs lost clarity. He commented during an interview, &quot;We bounced it back to do overdubs so many times we lost the sound of it. [The songs] sounded so great, but later on I was really disappointed with it.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Between the Buttons</em> proved to be the last album produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, with whom The Rolling Stones would have a creative falling-out in mid-1967 during the arduous and meandering recording sessions for <em><a href="Their_Satanic_Majesties_Request" title="wikilink">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a></em>.</p>

<p>The photo shoot for the album cover took place in November 1966 on <a href="Primrose_Hill" title="wikilink">Primrose Hill</a>, an ancient megalithic mound in North London. <a href="Gered_Mankowitz" title="wikilink">Gered Mankowitz</a> was the photographer. The shoot took place at 5:30 in the morning following an all night recording session at Olympic Studios. Using a home-made camera <a href="filter_(photography)" title="wikilink">filter</a> constructed of black card, glass and <a href="vaseline" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaseline</a>, Mankowitz created the effect of the Stones dissolving into their surroundings. The goal of the shoot was to, in Mankowitz's words, &quot;to capture the ethereal, druggy feel of the time; that feeling at the end of the night when dawn was breaking and they'd been up all night making music, stoned.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Brian's disheveled and ghostly appearance on the cover disturbed many of his fans, and critic David Dalton wrote that he looked &quot;like a doomed albino raccoon.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Brian [Jones] was lurking in his collar,&quot; Mankowitz commented years later, &quot;I was frustrated because it felt like we were on the verge of something really special and he was messing it up. But the way Brian appeared appeared to not give a shit is exactly what the band was about.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Outtakes from this photo session were later used for the cover and inner sleeves of the 1972 <a href="ABKCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABKCO</a> compilation release <em><a href="More_Hot_Rocks_(Big_Hits_&amp;_Fazed_Cookies)" title="wikilink">More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)</a></em>.</p>
<p>The back cover of <em>Between the Buttons</em> is dominated by a six-panel cartoon accompanied by a rhythmic poem drawn by drummer <a href="Charlie_Watts" title="wikilink">Charlie Watts</a>. When Watts asked Andrew Oldham what the title of the album would be, he told him it was between the buttons, a term meaning 'undecided'. Charlie gave the phrase to the title of his cartoon which in turn became the title of the album.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Much like <em>Aftermath</em>, <em>Between the Buttons</em> saw some differences in its UK and US versions. The UK edition (in the form producer <a href="Andrew_Loog_Oldham" title="wikilink">Andrew Loog Oldham</a> and The Rolling Stones intended it) was issued on January 20, 1967 (Mono, LK 4852;Stereo, SKL 4852) on <a href="Decca_Records" title="wikilink">Decca Records</a>, concurrently with a separate single, &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_Spend_the_Night_Together" title="wikilink">Let's Spend the Night Together</a>&quot; b/w &quot;<a href="Ruby_Tuesday" title="wikilink">Ruby Tuesday</a>&quot;. Because of common practice in the British record industry at the time, the single did not appear on the album. Generally well-received (although the critics took note of their influences), <em>Between the Buttons</em> reached #3 in the UK.</p>
<p>The albums was reviewed critically by <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a> Himself. When asked why he didn't like it, he responded, &quot;I don't know, it just isn't any good. 'Back Street Girl' is about the only one I like.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In an interview with <em><a href="New_Music_Express" title="wikilink">New Music Express</a></em>, he even called the rest of the album, &quot;more or less rubbish.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="us-release">US release</h3>
<p>In the US, the album was released by <a href="London_Records" title="wikilink">London Records</a> on February 11, 1967 (Mono, LL 3499;Stereo, PS 499). &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_Spend_the_Night_Together" title="wikilink">Let's Spend the Night Together</a>&quot; and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; were slotted onto the album while &quot;Back Street Girl&quot; and &quot;Please Go Home&quot; were removed (these would be included on the following US odds-and-ends release, <em><a href="Flowers_(Rolling_Stones_album)" title="wikilink">Flowers</a> in July 1967)</em>. With &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; reaching #1, <em>Between the Buttons</em> shot to #2 in the US, going gold.</p>
<p>In 2003, the album was ranked number 355 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 2002 both editions of <em>Between the Buttons</em> were reissued in a new remastered <a href="CD" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD</a> and <a href="Super_Audio_CD" title="wikilink">SACD</a> <a href="digipak" class="uri" title="wikilink">digipak</a> by <a href="ABKCO_Records" title="wikilink">ABKCO Records</a>. All reissues of the album since 1968 have been in stereo; the album's mono mix has yet to see an official release. While most reissues have used the US track-listing to maximize profit by featuring the two hit singles, the UK version was re-issued by ABKCO in 2003 on 180 gram vinyl in the US.</p>
