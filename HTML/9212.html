<p><strong>Typhoon Xangsane</strong> (international designation: <strong><em>0615</em></strong>, JTWC designation: <strong><em>18W</em></strong>, PAGASA name <strong>Typhoon Milenyo</strong>) was a deadly typhoon that affected the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>, <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="Thailand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thailand</a> during the <a href="2006_Pacific_typhoon_season" title="wikilink">2006 Pacific typhoon season</a>. It was the fifteenth tropical storm and ninth typhoon recognized by the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> operationally during the season, although in post-operational analysis it became the tenth typhoon of the season with the addition of Typhoon Maria. According to the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a>, Xangsane was the sixteenth tropical storm and tenth typhoon of the season, and was a <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Category 4-equivalent</a> typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speeds. The name Xangsane was submitted by <a href="Laos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laos</a> and means <a href="elephant" class="uri" title="wikilink">elephant</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines, battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over <a href="Manila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manila</a> and emerging over the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a>, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least $747 million (2006 USD) in damage.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="storm-history">Storm history</h2>

<p>On <a href="September_25" title="wikilink">September 25</a>, the <a href="Philippine_Atmospheric,_Geophysical_and_Astronomical_Services_Administration" title="wikilink">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) named an active low pressure area within its area of responsibility Tropical Depression Milenyo. Having earlier issued a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>, the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 18W the same day. On <a href="September_26" title="wikilink">September 26</a> the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) designated the system Tropical Storm Xangsane.</p>
<p>Xangsane rapidly intensified and later that day, the JMA upgraded Xangsane to a severe tropical storm. Xangsane made landfall on <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a> as a severe tropical storm, before a bout of further rapid intensification occurred. All three agencies, the JMA, JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the storm to a typhoon late on <a href="September_26" title="wikilink">September 26</a> or early <a href="September_27" title="wikilink">September 27</a>.</p>
<p>Xangsane then passed through the <a href="Philippines" title="wikilink">Philippine islands</a>, wreaking havoc and becoming the strongest typhoon to directly impact <a href="Metro_Manila" title="wikilink">Metro Manila</a> in eleven years.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As it entered the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> as a weak typhoon, it began to re-intensify, reaching its secondary peak strength shortly before landfall near <a href="Hu&lt;U+1EBF&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hu&lt;U+1EBF&gt;</a> on <a href="October_1" title="wikilink">October 1</a>. The JTWC ceased advisories after landfall, while the JMA carried the storm inland until it was over <a href="Thailand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thailand</a> as a tropical depression. It remained as a low pressure area over central <a href="Indochina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indochina</a> on the JMA's weather charts for several days, while the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a>'s Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system carried the remnants of Xangsane into the <a href="Bay_of_Bengal" title="wikilink">Bay of Bengal</a>.</p>

Storm Signal Number 2, for winds of 60–100 km/h (37–62 mph), was raised for northern <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a> and central Luzon. Storm Signal Number 1 (30–60 km/h, 20–37 mph) was issued for northwestern Luzon, including <a href="Metro_Manila" title="wikilink">Metro Manila</a>, and northern <a href="Visayas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visayas</a>, including the rest of <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a>. Schools in the warned area were suspended, and airports and seaports were closed. <a href="Philippine_Airlines" title="wikilink">Philippine Airlines</a> cancelled over half of its flights to and from <a href="Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Ninoy Aquino International Airport</a> for <a href="September_28" title="wikilink">September 28</a>, and various transit services also suspended service.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Metro Manila and the <a href="CALABARZON" title="wikilink">Tagalog provinces</a> were warned of possible flooding and strong winds.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>When it became clear that Xangsane would approach Metro Manila, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on <a href="September_28" title="wikilink">September 28</a>. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vietnam">Vietnam</h3>
<p>Prior to Xangsane's final landfall, the Vietnamese government set up a steering committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister <a href="Nguyen_Sinh_Hung" title="wikilink">Nguyen Sinh Hung</a> to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300,000 people from low-lying areas in <a href="Ha_Tinh" title="wikilink">Ha Tinh</a> and <a href="Phu_Yen" title="wikilink">Phu Yen</a>, as well as hilly areas prone to <a href="landslide" title="wikilink">landslides</a>.

<h3 id="thailand">Thailand</h3>
<p>Although Xangsane had weakened considerably over land, residents of northern Thailand were advised of the threat of flooding from the remnant low of Xangsane as it approached. The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation alerted its provincial offices throughout the country to be prepared for strong winds, <a href="flash_flood" title="wikilink">flash flooding</a>, and landslides. Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible <a href="mudslide" title="wikilink">mudslides</a>, and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Damage was widespread in the Philippines, particularly in <a href="Metro_Manila" title="wikilink">Metro Manila</a>, which the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In some parts of the country, electricity was cut of for up to six straight days.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while <a href="Luzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luzon</a> suffered an island-wide power outage.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400 people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and <a href="Bicol_Region" title="wikilink">Bicol Region</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila in 11 years, when <a href="1995_Pacific_typhoon_season#Super_Typhoon_Angela_(Rosing)" title="wikilink">Typhoon Angela</a> passed over the city.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="vietnam-1">Vietnam</h3>
<p>Xangsane made its second and final landfall in central Vietnam, causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion <a href="Vietnamese_dong" title="wikilink">Vietnamese dong</a> ($629 million, 2006 USD) in damage and killed 71 people. The worst structural damage occurred in the city of <a href="Da_Nang" title="wikilink">Da Nang</a>, where 26 people were killed.
