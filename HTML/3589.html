<p><strong><em>Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men</em></strong> constituted five volumes of <a href="Dionysius_Lardner" title="wikilink">Dionysius Lardner&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> 133-volume <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em> (1829–46). Written during the literary revolution that encouraged wider swaths of the populace to read, this encyclopedia appealed to the self-educating middle class.</p>
<p>The <em>Lives</em> were part of the <em>Cabinet of Biography</em> in the <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em>. The three-volume <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal</em> (1835–37) and the two-volume <em>Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France</em> (1838–39) cover biographies of important fourteenth- to eighteenth-century writers and thinkers. They were largely written by the <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> writer <a href="Mary_Shelley" title="wikilink">Mary Shelley</a>. Shelley's biographies reveal her to be a professional woman of letters who contracted to produce several volumes of works and was paid well to do so. Her extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of <a href="feminist" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminist</a> <a href="historiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">historiography</a> are all reflected in these works.</p>
<p>At times Shelley had trouble finding sufficient research materials and had to make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the <em>Spanish and Portuguese Lives</em>. She wrote in a style that combined her secondary sources, <a href="memoir" class="uri" title="wikilink">memoir</a> and anecdote, as well as her opinion. For example, her political views are most obvious in the <em>Italian Lives</em>, where she supports the <a href="Italian_unification" title="wikilink">Italian independence movement</a> and promotes <a href="republicanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">republicanism</a>. In the <em>French Lives</em> Shelley makes a particular effort to portray women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions, and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.</p>
<p>The <em>Lives</em> did not attract enough critical attention to become a bestseller. A fair number were still printed and sold, however; far more copies of the <em>Lives</em> circulated than of Shelley's novels, for example. Some of the volumes were pirated in the United States and praised by the poet <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have not been appreciated until recently.</p>

<p>During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, self-improvement literature became an important portion of the book market; &quot;it was the age of the 'Family Library' edition&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In his article on the <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em>, Morse Peckham writes, this &quot;revolution in literacy, [was] partly the result of the spread of liberal ideas by the French Revolution, [and] partly of the desire to combat those ideas by teaching the poor to read the Bible and religious tracts, [it] was to have an effect on modern society almost as profound as the industrial and agricultural revolutions&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Dionysius_Lardner" title="wikilink">Dionysius Lardner's</a> <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em>, published between 1829 and 1846, was one of the most successful of these enterprises, which also included <a href="John_Murray" title="wikilink">John Murray&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> <em>Family Library</em> and the publications of the <a href="Society_for_the_Propagation_of_Useful_Knowledge" title="wikilink">Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although intended for the &quot;general reader&quot;, the series was specifically for the middle-class rather than the masses.

<p>The series was divided into five &quot;Cabinets&quot;: Arts and Manufactures, Biography, History, Natural History, and Natural Philosophy.

To enforce the cultivation of religion and the practice of virtue should be a principal object with all who undertake to inform the public mind.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The series eventually contained 61 titles in 133 volumes and customers could purchase the entire set, a single cabinet, or a single volume.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The first volume was published in December 1829 by <a href="Longman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longman</a>, Reese, Orme, Browne, Greene, and <a href="John_Taylor_(1781-1864)" title="wikilink">John Taylor</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Thirty-eight identified authors contributed (others are unidentified);<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Mary_Shelley" title="wikilink">Mary Shelley</a> was the only female contributor and the eighth most productive.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Revered Dr. Dionysius Lardner, a science lecturer at <a href="London_University" title="wikilink">London University</a>, started the <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em> in 1827 or 1828.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The authors who contributed to the volumes spanned the political spectrum and included many luminaries of the day. <a href="James_Mackintosh" title="wikilink">James Mackintosh</a>, <a href="Walter_Scott" title="wikilink">Walter Scott</a>, <a href="Thomas_Moore" title="wikilink">Thomas Moore</a>, and <a href="Connop_Thirlwall" title="wikilink">Connop Thirlwall</a> wrote histories; <a href="Robert_Southey" title="wikilink">Robert Southey</a> wrote naval biographies; <a href="Henry_Roscoe" title="wikilink">Henry Roscoe</a> wrote legal biographies; <a href="John_Herschel" title="wikilink">John Herschel</a> wrote on astronomy and the philosophy of science; <a href="Augustus_de_Morgan" title="wikilink">August de Morgan</a> wrote on mathematics; David Brewster wrote on optics; and Lardner himself wrote on mathematics and physics.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Authors were paid about &lt;U+20A4&gt;200 for each volume; however, some of the contracts were disproportionately high or low. For example, Irish poet Thomas Moore was contracted to write a two-volume <em>History of Ireland</em> in two years for &lt;U+20A4&gt;1,500.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The overall project may have run into difficulty because it overpaid well-known writers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Moreover, many of the famous writers listed in the original prospectus never participated. Peckham speculates that this was because of the project's financial problems.

<p>The books were relatively expensive to print, due to the Corbould and Finden illustrations, images for the scientific volumes, and the use of <a href="Eyre_&amp;_Spottiswoode,_Ltd." title="wikilink">Spottiswoode's</a> printing house.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Four thousand copies of the first edition of the early volumes were probably printed, but the print run would have fallen to 2,500 as the sales did not pick up after 1835.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> As it became clear that the series was not going to take off, less publicity was undertaken: fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Lardner himself may also have become less interested in the project, as he stopped signing the business ledger after the middle of 1838.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, some volumes of the <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em> remained in print until 1890.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the popularity of encyclopedias at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the <em>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</em> did not receive enough critical attention to make it a bestseller. Often the reviews were &quot;perfunctory&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, some of the individual writers received attention. Moore, for example, was given a front page spread in the <em>Literary Gazette</em> for his history of Ireland.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s volumes received twelve reviews in total—a good number—but &quot;her name was never fully exploited&quot; in the project, whether by her choice or Lardner&lt;U+2019&gt;s is unclear.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> However, Peckham writes that &quot;the <em>Cyclopaedia</em> on the whole was a distinguished and valuable work&quot; and some of the individual volumes became famous.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>The eighteenth-century saw a new kind of history emerge with works such as <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume's</a> <em>History of England</em> (1754–63). Frustrated with traditional histories that only highlighted military and monarchical history, Hume and others &quot;place[d] a new emphasis on mercantile growth, industry, the arts, social relations, domestic life, and its affective components&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Combined with the rise of <a href="sensibility" class="uri" title="wikilink">sensibility</a> at the end of the eighteenth century, this &quot;produced an unprecedented historical interest in the social, the inward, and particularly the realm of affect&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> These topics and this style explicitly invited women into the discussion of history as both readers and writers.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, this new history often made the private sphere subordinate to the public sphere, therefore women writers took it upon themselves to bring the &quot;sentimental and private elements&quot; to &quot;the center of historical consciousness&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In this way, they argued for the political relevance of women. Women's sympathetic connection to those who were suffering enabled them to speak for marginalized groups, such as slaves or the poor.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Shelley practiced this early form of <a href="feminist" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminist</a> <a href="historiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">historiography</a>. For her, biographical writing was supposed to, in her words, &quot;form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and to teach &quot;lessons&quot;. These &quot;lessons&quot; consisted, most frequently and importantly, of criticisms of male-dominated institutions, such as <a href="primogeniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">primogeniture</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> She also praises societies that are progressive when it comes to gender relations, writing, for example: &quot;No slur was cast by the [Renaissance era] Italians on feminine accomplishments...Where abstruse learning was a fashion among men, they were glad to find in their friends of the other sex, minds educated to share their pursuits&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Shelley was particularly interested in tying private, domestic history to public, political history.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> She emphasizes the domestic, romance, the family, sympathy, and compassion in the lives of the people she is writing about. This is particularly true in the essays on <a href="Petrarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrarch</a> and <a href="Vincenzo_Monti" title="wikilink">Vincenzo Monti</a>, for example.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> She believed that these forces would improve society and that women could be at the forefront of them, tying her work to that of other early feminist historians such as <a href="Mary_Hays" title="wikilink">Mary Hays</a> and <a href="Anna_Jameson" title="wikilink">Anna Jameson</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Shelley argued that women possessed a &quot;distinctive virtue&quot; in their ability to sympathize with others and should use this ability to help improve society.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> She castigates <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, for example, for abandoning his children at a <a href="foundling_hospital" title="wikilink">foundling hospital</a>, decrying the &quot;masculine egotism&quot; associated with his philosophy in a criticism similar to the one she makes of Victor Frankenstein in <em><a href="Frankenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankenstein</a></em> (1818).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

However, the reviewer praises two of Mary Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s biographies: Petrarch and Machiavelli.

<p>During the two or three years that Mary Shelley spent writing the <em>Spanish and Portuguese Lives</em> from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, <em><a href="Falkner_(novel)" title="wikilink">Falkner</a></em> (1837), experienced the death of her father, <a href="William_Godwin" title="wikilink">William Godwin</a>, started to write a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, <a href="Percy_Florence_Shelley" title="wikilink">Percy Florence Shelley</a>, entered <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> She had more difficulty with these <em>Lives</em> than with the other volumes, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: &quot;I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish &amp; Portugeeze [<em>sic</em>] Lives &lt;U+2013&gt; This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, &amp; the difficulty of getting books &amp; information&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the <em>Spanish and Portuguese Lives</em>, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s subjects.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: &quot;The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting &lt;U+2013&gt; namely &lt;U+2013&gt; the treading in unknown paths &amp; dragging out unknown things &lt;U+2013&gt; I wish I could go to Spain.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> She also, while living in <a href="London_Borough_of_Harrow" title="wikilink">Harrow</a>, refused to go to the <a href="British_Library" title="wikilink">British Library</a> in London, writing: &quot;I would not if I could &lt;U+2013&gt; I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [<em>sic</em>] to their own&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of &lt;U+201C&gt;feminist protest&lt;U+201D&gt; others see it as &lt;U+201C&gt;matter of comfort and practicality&lt;U+201D&gt;, since the reading rooms were &lt;U+201C&gt;noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that &quot;there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate, even if she cannot be privy to information gleaned by subsequent scholarship&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors and when translations of the author's works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Shelley &quot;begins entries with information about the life and character of the writer, gives examples from their work both in their original language and in translation..., and concludes each entry with a summary of the beauties and defects of the writers&quot;.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> She also focuses on the problems of writing biography itself, engaging in a written dialogue with the biographical theories of her now-dead father. In &quot;Of History and Romance&quot; Godwin had written that for the genius, &quot;I am not contented to observe such a man upon the public stage, I would follow him into his closet. I would see the friend and the father of a family, as well as the patriot&quot;.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Shelley and Godwin had seen the negative effects of Godwin's theory when he published <em><a href="Memoirs_of_the_Author_of_A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman" title="wikilink">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a></em> (1798), his biography of Shelley's mother, <a href="Mary_Wollstonecraft" title="wikilink">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. Its frank description of Wollstonecraft's affairs and suicide attempts shocked the public and sullied her reputation. Shelley criticizes this technique in her biographies, concerned that &quot;follies&quot; are being perpetuated.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> She is even more &quot;concerned with the methodological dangers of inferring that because nothing is known, there never was anything to know&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Overall, the <em>Spanish Lives</em>, according to Vargo, &quot;tells a story of the survival of genius and moral independence in spite of oppression by public institutions, both individually and nationally&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Shelley argues that Spain's literature is directly related to its politics and she tried to &quot;inspired her readers with the best qualities of a nation as embodied in the life and works of its greatest writers&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> She also includes masked autobiographical comments.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>Mary Shelley worked on the <em>French Lives</em> from the end of 1837 until the middle of 1839 for which she was paid &lt;U+20A4&gt;200 upon completion.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> No other substantial projects occupied her during this time and research materials were easily accessible; she even subscribed to a specialist <a href="circulating_library" title="wikilink">circulating library</a> to acquire books.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>Mary Shelley spoke French fluently and was knowledgeable about seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French literature.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Although she was distilling other works, the biographies are still deeply personal works and have autobiographical elements.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Orr writes that they &quot;are the culmination of her work for Lardner, and represent the final stage of a sustained overview of four literatures.

<p>The <em>French Lives</em> also provided Shelley with a way to celebrate literary women, particularly the <em><a href="salon_(gathering)" title="wikilink">salonni&lt;U+00E9&gt;res</a></em>. In her life of de S&lt;U+00E9&gt;vign&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Shelley celebrates &quot;her chaste widowhood; her loyalty as a friend; [and] her maternal devotion&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Orr writes that &quot;looking more closely at the very various roles of women in the [<em>French Lives</em>], it is hard to see a clear pattern&quot;.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> She argues that &quot;the most consistent 'feminism' displayed throughout <em>French Lives II</em> lies in her examination of French attitudes toward love, marriage, and sexuality&quot;.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Shelley portrays customs such as taking lovers sympathetically, explaining it in the context of France's arranged marriages.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Overall, Orr explains, Shelley's &quot;historical sympathy for the varied circumstances of women's relationships mirrors her personal practice of understanding and assisting those of her women friends who transgressed moral norms&quot;.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The biographies of Roland and Sta&lt;U+00EB&gt;l pay close &quot;attention to women's abilities and the social conditions that either hinder or encourage their potential&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Shelley argues that women are as intellectually capable as men, but lack a sufficient education and are trapped by social systems such as marriage that restrict their rights.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The emphasis that Shelley places on education and reading reflect the influence of her mother's <em><a href="A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman" title="wikilink">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a></em> (1792).
