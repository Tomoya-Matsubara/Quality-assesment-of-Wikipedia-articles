<p><strong>Manhattan</strong> is a <a href="borough_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">borough</a> of <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a>, <a href="wikt:coterminous" title="wikilink">coterminous</a> with <strong>New York County</strong>. Although its <a href="United_States_Census,_2000" title="wikilink">2000 population</a> of 1,537,195 is only third largest of the five boroughs, after <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a> (2000 population of 2,465,326) and <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a> (2,229,379)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it is the most densely populated county in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> If all five boroughs were independent cities, Manhattan would rank as the sixth most populous city in the United States, behind Los Angeles, Chicago, Brooklyn, Queens, and Houston. The Island of Manhattan is the largest section of the borough and county, which also includes numerous smaller islands and a small section of the mainland adjacent to the Bronx.</p>
<p>Manhattan is the borough most closely associated with New York City by tourists; even natives of New York City's outer boroughs will describe a trip to Manhattan as &quot;going to the city&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A commercial, financial, and cultural center of the world, Manhattan has many famous landmarks, tourist attractions, museums and universities. It is also home to the headquarters of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> and the seat of city government. Historically, its commercial streets have been characterized by thousands of unique and diverse shops, though a more recent influx of national chains has caused it to increasingly resemble other American cities and suburbs at a higher density. New York City is home to the most corporate headquarters of any city in the nation, the overwhelming majority based in Manhattan.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the United States.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Lower Manhattan is home to both the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="NASDAQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASDAQ</a>, and is the nation's third-largest central business district (after <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>'s <a href="Chicago_Loop" title="wikilink">Loop</a>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

The large structure toward the tip of the island is Fort Amsterdam." alt="Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of New Amsterdam. The large structure toward the tip of the island is Fort Amsterdam." width="230" /> The name <em>Manhattan</em> derives from the word Manna-hata so written earliest in the 1609 logbook (Record of October 2) of Robert Juet, an officer of the <a href="Dutch_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch East India Company</a> yacht <em><a href="Halve_Maen" title="wikilink">Halve Maen</a></em> or Half Moon.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The ship was captained by <a href="Henry_Hudson" title="wikilink">Henry Hudson</a>, who, in the service of the <a href="Dutch_Republic" title="wikilink">Dutch Republic</a>, was covertly commissioned to seek a <a href="Northwest_Passage" title="wikilink">Northwest Passage</a> to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Half Moon first entered <a href="Upper_New_York_Bay" title="wikilink">Upper New York Bay</a> on <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="1609" class="uri" title="wikilink">1609</a>, and sailing up the lower <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>, anchored off the tip of northern Manhattan that night.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> As emissary of Holland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Lord-Lieutenant Maurits, he named the river he discovered after him; the Mauritius River.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It was the explorer Adriaen Block who, in a text of 1613, referred to it as &quot;Hudson's river&quot;. During the Dutch period the river was mostly referred to as the North River which, until this very day, is the name used by people active in the maritime industry.</p>
<p>A manuscript map of 1610 depicts the name Manahata twice, on the west as well as the east side of the Mauritius River (later named Hudson River), referring to the tribes that lived at the mouth of the river as the Manahata Indians. Later historians supposed that these people would have been the <a href="Lenape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenape</a> and some have translated the manifold variations of the word as &quot;island of many hills&quot; from the <a href="Lenape_language" title="wikilink">Lenape language</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1625, Johannes de Laet, Director of the <a href="Dutch_West_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch West India Company</a> wrote in his &lt;U+201C&gt;New World&lt;U+201D&gt;, &lt;U+201C&gt;The great North River of New-Netherland is called by some the Manhattas River from the people who dwell near its mouth; but by our countrymen it is generally called the Great River&lt;U+201D&gt;. In the 1630 edition, he continues to write of &lt;U+201C&gt;another fort of greater importance at the mouth of the same North River, upon an island which OUR people call Manhattas or Manhattans Island, because of this nation of Indians happened to possess the same, and by them it has been sold to the company&lt;U+201D&gt;. He thus confirmed that the island had been purchased in 1626 by <a href="Peter_Minuit" title="wikilink">Peter Minuit</a>, the third director of <a href="New_Netherland" title="wikilink">New Netherland</a> from the native <a href="Lenape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenape</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> for 60 guilders worth of trade goods<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> (traditionally converted to about $24) which according to the Oregon State University website's estimated conversion factors, is about the equivalent of 500&lt;U+2013&gt;700 <a href="United_States_Dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a> today. However, if the money had been invested at anything above a 6.25% return (essentially a bond's current yield), it would be worth over $250 billion today, which exceeds Manhattan's estimated value of $200 billion.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>It is generally assumed that the <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> navigator <a href="Giovanni_da_Verrazzano" title="wikilink">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a> explored <a href="New_York_Harbor" title="wikilink">New York Harbor</a> in 1524<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and that a few months later the <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> <a href="Esteban_G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez" title="wikilink">Esteban G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez</a> did the same.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, there is no evidence of any exploration, latitude calculations, surveying or mapping. There is only a vague textual description of having seen an estuary that may perhaps resemble Hudson&lt;U+2019&gt;s river. None of those navigators from other nations had penetrated well into the bay or explored the chief river substantiated with textual and visual evidence until the Dutch did so in 1609.</p>
<p>New Netherland was settled first in 1624 when thirty families disembarked from the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelis Jacobsz May, New Netherland&lt;U+2019&gt;s first director, and settled on <a href="Governors_Island" title="wikilink">Governors Island</a>. Peter Minuit was among them as volunteer. Their arrival transformed New Netherland into a province of the Dutch Republic from, previously, a territory for exploration and private trade since its discovery by the [Dutch] East India Company in 1609. Some of the settlers were spread around the territory in order to take physical and legal possession according to the Law of Nations. On this basis, the year 1624 has been recognized by the <a href="New_York_Legislature" title="wikilink">New York Legislature</a> as the birth date of New York State.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The States General (parliament) of the Dutch Republic had promised a trade monopoly for anyone who first would create and deliver a map based on private explorations and surveys for the territory situated between 40 and 45 degrees latitude. It was Adriaen Block and his partner Hendrick Christaensz who, based on four voyages, delivered a map in October 1614 to the States General on which they named the territory New Netherland. As a result, various trading companies amalgamated into the <a href="New_Netherland_Company" title="wikilink">New Netherland Company</a> in 1614, which was the recipient of a private trade monopoly with the natives.</p>
<p>In 1625, the second director of New Netherland, Willem Verhulst, together with his Council, selected Manhattan Island as the place for the construction of a Fort Amsterdam, a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals. Land surveyor and civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz van Lobbrecht arrived in June 1625 to lay out Fort Amsterdam at Manhattan&lt;U+2019&gt;s tip. The citadel's original design called for it being open at the waterside on the west as per instructions of <a href="April_25" title="wikilink">April 25</a>, <a href="1625" class="uri" title="wikilink">1625</a>, to civil engineer Cryn Fredericxsz, director Verhulst and his council. The year 1625 is therefore recognized as the birth date of New York City.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1664, <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">King Charles II</a> had resolved to annex New Netherland and consolidate it with his North American possessions in order &lt;U+201C&gt;to install one form of government, both in church and state &lt;U+2026&gt; to install the Anglican government as in Old England&lt;U+201D&gt;. He sent an expeditionary force composed of New Englanders and &lt;U+201C&gt;reinforced by four royal ships crammed full with an extraordinary amount of men and warlike stores&lt;U+201D&gt; and demanded New Netherland&lt;U+2019&gt;s surrender. Director General <a href="Peter_Stuyvesant" title="wikilink">Peter Stuyvesant</a> and his council negotiated 24 articles of provisional transfer, which gave New Netherlanders liberties and freedoms unlike those available to <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New Englanders</a> and <a href="Virginia" title="wikilink">Virginians</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> New York County was named in honor of the Royal Majesty of Great Britain, the <a href="Duke_of_York" title="wikilink">Duke of York</a>, later to become the Catholic <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James II of England</a>, after whom the City and State of New York were also named.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Consequently, the negotiations assured that the legal and political tradition of tolerance as the basis of cultural diversity and pluralism since 1624 was perpetuated by the Articles of Transfer under English authority. Thus safeguarded, the notion of tolerance endured after conclusive jurisdictional establishment of English dominion over New Netherland in 1674, and through the formation of the United States of America, when it was reintroduced as a constitutional right under the <a href="United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="wikilink">Bill of Rights</a> in 1791. In 1691, however, the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic religion</a> was outlawed in New York by an act of parliament. This ban technically remained in effect until the signing of the <a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1783.</p>
<p><img src="Manhattan1942.jpg" title="fig:Lower Manhattan in 1942" alt="Lower Manhattan in 1942" width="300" /> <img src="Skyline_Twin_Towers_photo_by_Sander_Lamme.jpg" title="fig:Manhattan skyline with the Twin Towers." alt="Manhattan skyline with the Twin Towers." width="300" /> From <a href="January_11" title="wikilink">January 11</a>, <a href="1785" class="uri" title="wikilink">1785</a> to Autumn 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals under the <a href="Articles_of_Confederation" title="wikilink">Articles of Confederation</a>, with the <a href="Continental_Congress" title="wikilink">Continental Congress</a> residing at <a href="New_York_City_Hall" title="wikilink">New York City Hall</a> then at <a href="Fraunces_Tavern" title="wikilink">Fraunces Tavern</a>. New York was the first capital of the country under the newly enacted <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Constitution of the United States</a> from <a href="March_4" title="wikilink">March 4</a>, <a href="1789" class="uri" title="wikilink">1789</a> to <a href="August_12" title="wikilink">August 12</a>, <a href="1790" class="uri" title="wikilink">1790</a> at <a href="Federal_Hall" title="wikilink">Federal Hall</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>New York City, surrounded by two brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water available on the island, which dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>. To supply the needs of the growing population, the city acquired land in <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester County</a> and constructed the <a href="Croton_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Croton Aqueduct</a> system, which went into service in 1842. The system took water from a dam at the <a href="Croton_River" title="wikilink">Croton River</a>, and sent it down through <a href="the_Bronx" title="wikilink">the Bronx</a>, over the <a href="Harlem_River" title="wikilink">Harlem River</a> via the <a href="High_Bridge_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">High Bridge</a>, to storage reservoirs in <a href="Central_Park" title="wikilink">Central Park</a> and at <a href="42nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">42nd Street</a> and <a href="Fifth_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Fifth Avenue</a>, and through a network of cast iron pipes on to consumer's faucets. In the early twentieth century, the existing water supply system was supplemented with much larger reservoirs in the <a href="Catskill_Mountains" title="wikilink">Catskill Mountains</a>, connected to the city by a series of mammoth water tunnels.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time of creation of New York County in 1683, its territory consisted of Manhattan Island, and occupied the same area that it occupies today. In 1874, the western portion of the present <a href="The_Bronx" title="wikilink">Bronx County</a> was transferred to New York County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In 1898, when the <a href="City_of_Greater_New_York" title="wikilink">City of Greater New York</a> was constituted as five boroughs, the separate boroughs of Manhattan and of the Bronx were formed, though both remained within the single County of New York. On <a href="January_1" title="wikilink">January 1</a>, <a href="1914" class="uri" title="wikilink">1914</a>, legislation tool effect taking those parts of the then New York County which had been annexed from <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester County</a> as the new Bronx County, and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>From the latter half of the 1960s through most of the 1970s, Manhattan suffered from <a href="Urban_Exodus" title="wikilink">urban flight</a> as much of the middle-class fled to the suburbs due to an increase in crime. However, as with many other American cities, there was an increase in population growth in the latter part of the century due to a renewed interest in the urban lifestyle, a trend that began in the late 1980s and has continued to present day. It was thought that the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> would initiate a new exodus from the City due to a fear of <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a>, but this has not occurred.</p>

The borough of Manhattan includes both Manhattan Island and several small islands, including <a href="Randall&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Randall's Island</a>, <a href="Ward&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Ward's Island</a>, and <a href="Roosevelt_Island" title="wikilink">Roosevelt Island</a> in the East River, and <a href="Governors_Island" title="wikilink">Governors Island</a> and <a href="Liberty_Island" title="wikilink">Liberty Island</a> to the south in <a href="New_York_Harbor" title="wikilink">New York Harbor</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Manhattan Island is 22.7 square miles (58.8 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) in area, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) long and 2.3 miles (3.7 km) wide, at its widest (near <a href="14th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">14th Street</a>).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> New York County as a whole covers a total area of 33.77 square miles (87.46 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), of which 22.96 square miles (59.47 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) are land and 10.81 square miles (28.00 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) are water.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>One Manhattan neighborhood is actually contiguous with The Bronx. <a href="Marble_Hill,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Marble Hill</a> at one time was part of Manhattan Island, but the <a href="Spuyten_Duyvil_Creek" title="wikilink">Harlem River Ship Canal</a>, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Before <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan's land has been considerably altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial <a href="land_reclamation" title="wikilink">land reclamation</a> along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a> with modern developments such as <a href="Battery_Park_City" title="wikilink">Battery Park City</a>, created from land excavated during the construction of the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>.

<p>The <a href="Commissioners&#39;_Plan_of_1811" title="wikilink">Commissioners' Plan of 1811</a>, called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>, each 100 feet wide (30 m), with <a href="First_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">First Avenue</a> on the east side and <a href="Twelfth_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Twelfth Avenue</a> in the west.

Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as 100 feet wide&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="14th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">14th</a>, <a href="23rd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">23rd</a>, <a href="34th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">34th</a>, <a href="42nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">42nd</a>, <a href="59th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">59th</a>, <a href="72nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">72nd</a>, <a href="86th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">86th</a>, <a href="96th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">96th</a>, 106th, <a href="116th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">116th</a>, <a href="125th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">125th</a>, 135th, 145th and 155th Streets&lt;U+2014&gt;and almost all have become the borough's major crosstown transportation and shopping venues.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Broadway_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at <a href="Bowling_Green_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">Bowling Green</a> in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a> and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip.

<p>In Manhattan, <em>uptown</em> means north and <em>downtown</em> means south.

<p><img src="Manhattan_Municipal_Building_by_David_Shankbone_edited-1.jpg" title="fig:Manhattan Municipal Building" alt="Manhattan Municipal Building" /> Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter, which has provided for a &quot;strong&quot; <a href="Mayor-council_government" title="wikilink">mayor-council system</a> since its revision in 1989.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The office of <a href="Borough_President" title="wikilink">Borough President</a> was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the <a href="New_York_City_Board_of_Estimate" title="wikilink">New York City Board of Estimate</a>, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fourteenth Amendment's</a> <a href="Equal_Protection_Clause" title="wikilink">Equal Protection Clause</a> pursuant to the high court's 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 1990, the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Manhattan's <a href="Borough_President" title="wikilink">Borough President</a> is <a href="Scott_Stringer" title="wikilink">Scott Stringer</a>, elected as a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> in 2005.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Each of the city's five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and <a href="District_Attorney" title="wikilink">District Attorney</a>, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. <a href="Robert_M._Morgenthau" title="wikilink">Robert M.

It also has 12 administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents. As the host of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, the borough is home to the world's largest international <a href="Consul_(representative)" title="wikilink">consular corps</a>, comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> It is also the home of <a href="New_York_City_Hall" title="wikilink">New York City Hall</a>, the seat of New York City government housing the <a href="Mayor_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">Mayor of New York City</a> and the <a href="New_York_City_Council" title="wikilink">New York City Council</a>.

<p>Manhattan is one of the <a href="Highest-income_counties_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">highest-income places</a> in the United States with a population greater than 1 million. Based on <a href="Internal_Revenue_Service" title="wikilink">IRS</a> data for the 2004 tax year, New York County (Manhattan) had the highest average federal income tax liability per return in the country.

<p>Lower Manhattan (Manhattan south of <a href="Houston_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Houston Street</a>) has a sharply different population than the rest of the borough. According to the 2000 census, the neighborhood was 41% Asian, 32% non-Hispanic white, 19% Hispanic and 6% black. 43% of residents were immigrants. These figures are affected by the demographic weight of Chinatown, which accounts for 55% of the population of Lower Manhattan. While the <a href="Financial_District,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Financial District</a> had few non-commercial residents after the 1950s, the area has seen a significant surge in its residential population, with estimates showing over 30,000 residents living in the area as of 2005, a jump from the 15,000 to 20,000 before the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Manhattan is a religiously diverse community.

<p>The borough is also experiencing a baby boom that is unique among American cities; since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%. The growth is largely driven by the children of affluent white families. Manhattan&lt;U+2019&gt;s 35,000 or so white non-Hispanic toddlers are being raised by parents whose median income was $284,208 in 2005, which means they are growing up in wealthier households than similar youngsters in any other large county in the country. Among white families with toddlers, San Francisco ranked second, with a median income of $150,763, followed by Somerset, N.J. ($136,807); San Jose, Calif. ($134,668); Fairfield, Conn. ($132,427); and Westchester, N.Y. ($122,240).<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p><img src="6thAvenuefrom49th.JPG" title="fig:Skyscrapers along Sixth Avenue." alt="Skyscrapers along Sixth Avenue." width="200" /> Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City. Its most important economic sector is the finance industry. The 280,000 workers in the finance industry collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, although they hold fewer than one of every six jobs in the borough. The pay gap between them and the 1.5 million other workers in Manhattan continues to widen, causing some economists to worry about New York City's growing dependence on their extraordinary incomes. Those high salaries contribute to job growth, but most of this job growth occurs in lower-paying service jobs in restaurants, retail and home health care and not many jobs in highly paid areas.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the 325 largest counties in the United States. The national average was $784.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Wages in Manhattan were also the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched on <a href="Washington_Square_Park" title="wikilink">Washington Square Park</a> to commemorate the <a href="Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire" title="wikilink">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire</a>, which killed 146 workers on <a href="March_25" title="wikilink">March 25</a>, <a href="1911" class="uri" title="wikilink">1911</a>. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of female independence, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> <img src="Times_Square_(Tall).jpg" title="fig:Times Square is the center of the city&#39;s theater district." alt="Times Square is the center of the city&#39;s theater district." /> The <a href="Harlem_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Harlem Renaissance</a> in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States. Manhattan's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American <a href="pop_art" title="wikilink">pop art</a> movement, which gave birth to such giants as <a href="Jasper_Johns" title="wikilink">Jasper Johns</a> and <a href="Roy_Lichtenstein" title="wikilink">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. Perhaps no other artist is as associated with the downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s as <a href="Andy_Warhol" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a>, who socialized at clubs like <a href="Serendipity_3" title="wikilink">Serendipity 3</a> and <a href="Studio_54" title="wikilink">Studio 54</a> and was shot in the chest in 1968 by the radical feminist <a href="Valerie_Solanas" title="wikilink">Valerie Solanas</a>, founder of the group &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; (S.C.U.M.) and author of the <a href="SCUM_Manifesto" title="wikilink">SCUM Manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>A popular haven for art, the downtown neighborhood of <a href="Chelsea,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Chelsea</a> is widely known for its galleries and cultural events.</p>
<p><a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway theatre</a> is often considered the highest professional form of theatre in the United States. <a href="Play" title="wikilink">Plays</a> and <a href="musical_theater" title="wikilink">musicals</a> are staged in one of the thirty-nine larger professional theatres, all but one located in Midtown Manhattan in and around Times Square, with 500 seats or more, that appeal to the mass audience. Broadway theatres are usually run by a producing organization or another theatre group. A little more than a mile from Times Square is the <a href="Lincoln_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">Lincoln Center</a>, home to one of the world's most prestigious opera houses, that of the <a href="Metropolitan_Opera" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Opera</a>.</p>
<p>Manhattan is also home to some of the most extensive art collections, both contemporary and historical, in the world including the <a href="Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="wikilink">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA), the <a href="Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art" title="wikilink">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, and the <a href="Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum" title="wikilink">Guggenheim Museum</a>.</p>
<p>The borough has a place in several American <a href="idiom" title="wikilink">idioms</a>. The phrase <em>&quot;<a href="New_York_minute_(time)" title="wikilink">a New York minute</a>&quot;</em> is meant to convey a very short period of time, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in &quot;perhaps faster than you would believe is possible&quot;.

Some 20,000 workers crafted the topography to create the English-style pastoral landscape Olmsted and Vaux sought to create. Workers moved nearly 3 million cubic yards of soil and planted more than 270,000 trees and shrubs.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<p>In the early days of Manhattan, wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires. In 1776, shortly after the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British, a massive fire broke out destroying one-third of the city and some 500 houses.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>Manhattan is unique in the United States for its intense use of <a href="public_transportation" title="wikilink">public transportation</a> and lack of private car ownership.

In the early twentieth century, men would hang out on the corner here on Twenty-third Street and watch the wind blowing women's dresses up so that they could catch a little bit of ankle. This entered into popular culture and there are hundreds of postcards and illustrations of women with their dresses blowing up in front of the Flatiron Building. And it supposedly is where the slang expression &quot;23 skidoo&quot; comes from because the police would come and give the voyeurs the 23 skidoo to tell them to get out of the area.&quot;<a href="#fnref89" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
