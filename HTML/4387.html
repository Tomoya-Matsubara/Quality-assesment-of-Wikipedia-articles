<p>The <strong>Treaty</strong> or <strong>Peace of Venice</strong>, <a href="1177_in_Italy" title="wikilink">1177</a>, was an important <a href="peace_treaty" title="wikilink">peace treaty</a> between the <a href="papacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">papacy</a> and its allies, the north Italian city-states of the <a href="Lombard_League" title="wikilink">Lombard League</a>, and <a href="Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. The Norman <a href="Kingdom_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Sicily</a> also took part in negotiations and the treaty thereby determined the political course of all <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> for the next several years.</p>
<p>The treaty followed on the heels of the <a href="Battle_of_Legnano" title="wikilink">Battle of Legnano</a> of 29 May 1176, a defeat for Frederick Barbarossa. Frederick quickly thereafter sent envoys to <a href="Pope_Alexander_III" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander III</a> at <a href="Anagni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anagni</a>, asking for an end to the schism between him and Frederick's <a href="antipope" class="uri" title="wikilink">antipope</a>, <a href="Antipope_Callixtus_III" title="wikilink">Callixtus III</a>. After a preliminary agreement was reached, a conference was scheduled for July 1177. Frederick spent some time in the interim interfering in Venetian rivalries in hopes of securing a pro-Imperial group in power at the time of the confrontation.</p>
<p>On 24 July, the pope from the <a href="Basilica_di_San_Marco" title="wikilink">Basilica di San Marco</a> sent a delegation of cardinals to the emperor in the <a href="Lido_di_Venezia" title="wikilink">Lido</a>, at the mouth of the Venetian Lagoon. The emperor formally acknowledged Alexander as pope and abandoned his own antipope; the cardinals formally lifted the excommunication that had hitherto been placed upon him. <a href="Sebastian_Ziani" title="wikilink">Sebastian Ziani</a>, the <a href="doge_of_Venice" title="wikilink">doge of Venice</a>, and <a href="Ulrich_II_von_Treven" title="wikilink">Ulrich II von Treven</a>, the <a href="patriarch_of_Aquileia" title="wikilink">patriarch of Aquileia</a>, then escorted the emperor into Venice itself. The delegates of the king of Sicily were <a href="Romuald,_Archbishop_of_Salerno" title="wikilink">Romuald, Archbishop of Salerno</a>, a chronicler of his time who left us a great eyewitness account of the whole scene, and Count <a href="Roger_of_Andria" title="wikilink">Roger of Andria</a>.</p>
<p>In the treaty that was concluded, the emperor recognised the temporal rights of the popes over the city of <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, despite which the city did not surrender to the pope and forced him to leave in 1179. A fifteen-year peace was concluded between Frederick and <a href="William_II_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">William II of Sicily</a>, paving the way for Sicily's golden years of peace and prosperity. Likewise a six-year truce was concluded with the Lombard League, but negotiations were to continue, and the emperor finally recognised the independence of the Lombard cities in the <a href="Peace_of_Constance" title="wikilink">Peace of Constance</a> of 1183.</p>
