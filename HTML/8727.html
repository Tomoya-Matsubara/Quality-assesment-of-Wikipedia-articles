<p>&quot;<strong>Bollocks</strong>&quot;  is a word of <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> origin, meaning &quot;<a href="testicles" class="uri" title="wikilink">testicles</a>&quot;. The word is often used figuratively in <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">British English</a> and <a href="Hiberno-English" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiberno-English</a> as a noun to mean &quot;nonsense&quot;, an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to mean &quot;poor quality&quot; or &quot;useless&quot;. Similarly, the common phrases &quot;<em>Bollocks</em> to this!&quot; or &quot;That's a load of old <em>bollocks</em>&quot; generally indicate <a href="contempt" class="uri" title="wikilink">contempt</a> for a certain task, subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as &quot;the dog's <em>bollocks</em>&quot;, &quot;top <em>bollock(s)</em>&quot;, or more simply &quot;the <em>bollocks</em>&quot; (as opposed to just &quot;<em>bollocks</em>&quot;), which will refer to something which is admired, approved of or well-respected.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>The word has a long and distinguished history, with the <em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em> (OED) giving examples of its usage dating back to the 13th century. One of the early references is <a href="Wycliffe&#39;s_Bible" title="wikilink">John Wycliffe bible</a> (1382), <a href="Leviticus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leviticus</a> xxii, 24: &quot;Al beeste, that ... kitt and taken a wey the <em>ballokes</em> is, ye shulen not offre to the Lord...&quot; (any beast that is cut and taken away the <em>bollocks</em>, you shall not offer to the Lord, <em>i.e.</em> <a href="castration" title="wikilink">castrated</a> animals are not suitable as sacrifices).</p>
<p>The OED states (with abbreviations expanded): &quot;Probably a derivative of <a href="Proto-Germanic" title="wikilink">Teutonic</a> <em>ball-</em>, of which the Old English representative would be inferred as <em>beall-u</em>, <em>-a</em>, or <em>-e</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The Teutonic <em>ball-</em> in turn probably derives from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European_language" title="wikilink">Proto-Indo-European</a> base <em>*bhel-</em>, to inflate or swell. This base also forms the root of many other words, including &quot;<a href="phallus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phallus</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-nonsense">Meaning &quot;nonsense&quot;</h3>
<p>From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, <em>bollocks</em> or <em>ballocks</em> was allegedly used as a slang term for a clergyman, although this meaning is not mentioned by the OED's 1989 edition. For example, in 1864, the Commanding Officer of the Straits Fleet regularly referred to his chaplain as <em>&quot;Ballocks&quot;</em>. It has been suggested that <em>bollocks</em> came to have its modern meaning of &quot;<a href="nonsense" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonsense</a>&quot; because clergymen were notorious for talking nonsense during their sermons.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="severity">Severity</h2>
<p>Originally, the word &quot;bollocks&quot; was the everyday vernacular word for testicles&lt;U+2014&gt;as noted above, it was used in this sense in the first English-language bible, in the 14th century. By the mid-seventeenth century, at least, it had begun to acquire coarse figurative meanings (see section on &quot;bollocking&quot;), for example in a translation of works by <a href="Rabelais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rabelais</a>.</p>
<p>It did not appear in <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Samuel Johnson</a>'s 1755 dictionary of the English language.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was also omitted from the 1933 <a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a> and its 1941 reprint, finally appearing in the 1972 supplement.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The first modern English dictionary to include an entry for &quot;bollocks&quot; was G. N. Garmonsway's Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.</p>
<p>The relative severity of the various <a href="profanity" title="wikilink">profanities</a>, as perceived by the British public, was studied on behalf of the <a href="Ofcom" title="wikilink">Broadcasting Standards Commission</a>, <a href="Independent_Television_Commission" title="wikilink">Independent Television Commission</a>, <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> and <a href="Advertising_Standards_Authority_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Advertising Standards Authority</a>. The results of this jointly commissioned research were published in December 2000 in a paper called &quot;Delete Expletives?&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This placed &quot;bollocks&quot; in eighth position in terms of its perceived severity, between &quot;prick&quot; (seventh place) and &quot;<a href="Asshole" title="wikilink">arsehole</a>&quot; (ninth place).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By comparison, the word &quot;balls&quot; (which has some similar meanings) was down in 22nd place. Of the people surveyed, 25% thought that &quot;bollocks&quot; should not be broadcast at all, and only 11% thought that it could acceptably be broadcast at times before the national 9 pm &quot;<a href="watershed_(television)" title="wikilink">watershed</a>&quot; on television (radio does not have a watershed).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> 25% of the people regarded &quot;bollocks&quot; as &quot;very severe&quot;, 32% &quot;quite severe&quot;, 34% &quot;mild&quot; and 8% considered it &quot;not swearing&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>A survey of the language of London teenagers (published in 2002) examined, amongst other things, the incidence of various swearwords in their speech. It noted that the top ten swearwords make up 81% of the total swearwords. &quot;Bollocks&quot; was the seventh most frequent swearword, after &quot;fucking&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;bloody&quot;, &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;fuck off&quot;. Below &quot;Bollocks&quot; were &quot;bastard&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;damn&quot;, in eighth, ninth and tenth places.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This research regarded these words as swearwords in the context of their usage but noted that some might be inoffensive in other contexts.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Perhaps the best-known use of the term is in the title of the 1977 <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> album <em><a href="Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here&#39;s_the_Sex_Pistols" title="wikilink">Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols</a></em>. Testimony in a resulting prosecution over the term demonstrated that in <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a>, the word referred to a priest, and could also be used to mean &quot;nonsense&quot;. Defence <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a> <a href="John_Mortimer" title="wikilink">John Mortimer</a> <a href="Queen&#39;s_Counsel" title="wikilink">QC</a> and <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a> won the case: the court ruled that the word was not <a href="obscene" class="uri" title="wikilink">obscene</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> It just means &quot;put aside all of that other rubbish and pay attention to this.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Tony Wright, a <a href="Leicestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a> trader, was given an &lt;U+00A3&gt;80 fixed penalty fine by police for selling T-shirts bearing the slogan &quot;<em>Bollocks to <a href="Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">Blair</a></em>&quot;. This took place on 29 June 2006 at the Royal Norfolk Show; the police issued the penalty notice, quoting Section 5 of the <a href="Public_Order_Act_1986" title="wikilink">Public Order Act 1986</a> which refers to language &quot;deemed to cause harassment, alarm or distress&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Commentators have made comparisons with the Sex Pistols case,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> pointing to some of the statements made by John Mortimer QC: &quot;What sort of country are we living in if a politician comes to <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> and speaks here to a group of people in the city centre and, during his speech, a heckler replies <em>&quot;bollocks&quot;</em>. Are we to expect this person to be incarcerated, or do we live in a country where we are proud of our <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> language?&quot;.</p>
