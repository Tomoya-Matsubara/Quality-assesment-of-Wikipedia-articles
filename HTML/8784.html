<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The documented history of music in Baltimore extends to the 1780s. Little is known about the cultural lives of the Native Americans who formerly lived along the Chesapeake Bay, prior to the founding of Baltimore. In the colonial era, opera and theatrical music were a major part of Baltimorean musical life, and Protestant churches were another important avenue for music performance and education. Baltimore rose to regional performance as an industrial and commercial center, and also become home to some of the most important <a href="music_publishing" title="wikilink">music publishing</a> firms in colonial North America. In the 19th century, Baltimore grew greatly, and its documented music expanded to include an abundance of <a href="African_American_music" title="wikilink">African American music</a>, and the city's denizens played a crucial role in the development of <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel music</a> and <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>. Musical institutions based in Baltimore, including the <a href="Peabody_Institute" title="wikilink">Peabody Institute</a> and the <a href="Baltimore_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Baltimore Symphony Orchestra</a>, became fixtures in their respective fields, <a href="music_education" title="wikilink">music education</a> and <a href="Western_classical_music" title="wikilink">Western classical music</a>.

<p>Local music in Baltimore can be traced back to 1784, when concerts were advertised in the local press. These concert programs featured compositions by locals <a href="Alexander_Reinagle" title="wikilink">Alexander Reinagle</a> and <a href="Raynor_Taylor" title="wikilink">Raynor Taylor</a>, as well as European composers like <a href="Frantisek_Kotzwara" title="wikilink">Frantisek Kotzwara</a>, <a href="Ignaz_Pleyel" title="wikilink">Ignaz Pleyel</a>, <a href="Carl_Ditters_von_Dittersdorf" title="wikilink">Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf</a>, <a href="Giovanni_Battista_Viotti" title="wikilink">Giovanni Battista Viotti</a> and <a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Opera first came to Baltimore in 1752, with the performance of <em><a href="The_Beggar&#39;s_Opera" title="wikilink">The Beggar's Opera</a></em> by a touring company.

Shakespearean and other plays made up the repertoire, often with wide-ranging modifications, including the addition of songs. The managers of the Maryland Company had some trouble finding qualified musicians to play in the theatre's orchestra.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Maryland Company and the American Company performed sporadically in Baltimore until the early 1790s, when the Philadelphia Company of <a href="Alexander_Reinagle" title="wikilink">Alexander Reinagle</a> and <a href="Thomas_Wignell" title="wikilink">Thomas Wignell</a> began dominating, based out of their <a href="Holliday_Street_Theater" title="wikilink">Holliday Street Theater</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Formal singing schools were the first well-documented musical institution in Baltimore. They were common in colonial North America prior to the Revolutionary War, but were not established in Baltimore until afterwards, in 1789. These singing schools were taught by instructors known as <em>masters</em>, or <em>singing masters</em>, and were often itinerant; they taught vocal performance and techniques for use in Christian <a href="psalmody" class="uri" title="wikilink">psalmody</a>. The first singing school in Baltimore was founded in the courthouse, in 1789, by <a href="Ishmael_Spicer" title="wikilink">Ishmael Spicer</a>, whose students would include the future <a href="John_Cole_(music_publisher)" title="wikilink">John Cole</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="publishing">Publishing</h4>
<p>The first tunebook published in Maryland was the <em>Baltimore Collection of Sacred Music</em>, in 1792, consisting mostly of hymns, with some more complex pieces described as anthems.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1794, <a href="Joseph_Carr_(music_publisher)" title="wikilink">Joseph Carr</a> established a shop in Baltimore, along with his sons <a href="Thomas_Carr_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Thomas</a> and <a href="Benjamin_Carr" title="wikilink">Benjamin</a>, who ran shops in New York and Philadelphia. The Carrs would be the most successful publishing firm until around the turn of the 19th century; however, they remained prominent until the company folded in 1821, and the Carrs were responsible for the first sheet music publication of &quot;<a href="The_Star-Spangled_Banner" title="wikilink">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>&quot; in 1814, arranged by Thomas Carr himself, and they also published European instrumentals and stage pieces, as well as works by Americans like <a href="James_Hewitt" title="wikilink">James Hewitt</a> and <a href="Alexander_Reinagle" title="wikilink">Alexander Reinagle</a>. Much of this music was collected, in serial format, in the <em>Musical Journal for the Piano Forte</em>, which spanned five volumes and was the largest collection of secular music in the country.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late 17th century, Americans like <a href="William_Billings" title="wikilink">William Billings</a> were establishing a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. <a href="John_Cole_(music_publisher)" title="wikilink">John Cole</a>, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook <em>Beauties of Psalmody</em>, which denigrated the new techniques, especially <a href="fugue" title="wikilink">fuguing</a>. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore was home to other major music publishers as well. These included <a href="Wheeler_Gillet" title="wikilink">Wheeler Gillet</a>, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and <a href="Samuel_Dyer_(music)" title="wikilink">Samuel Dyer</a>, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using a broad array of <a href="music_education" title="wikilink">music education</a> techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of <a href="Heinrich_Pestalozzi" title="wikilink">Heinrich Pestalozzi</a>, interpreted by the American <a href="Lowell_Mason" title="wikilink">Lowell Mason</a>. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master <a href="James_M._Deems" title="wikilink">James M.

<h3 id="th-century">19th century</h3>
<p>19th century Baltimore had a large African American population, and was home to a vibrant black musical life, especially based around the region's numerous Protestant churches. The city also boasted several major music publishing firms and instrument manufacturing companies, specializing in <a href="piano" title="wikilink">pianos</a> and <a href="woodwind_instrument" title="wikilink">woodwind instruments</a>. Opera, choral and other classical performance groups were founded during this era, many of them becoming regionally prominent and established a classical tradition in Baltimore. The Holliday Street Theatre and the Front Street Theatre hosted both touring and local productions throughout the early 19th century. Following the Civil War, however, a number of new theatres opened, including the <a href="Academy_of_Music_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Academy of Music</a>, <a href="Ford&#39;s_Grand_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Ford's Grand Opera House</a> and the <a href="Concordia_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Concordia Opera House</a>, owned by the <a href="Concordia_Music_Society" title="wikilink">Concordia Music Society</a>. Of these, Ford's was perhaps the most successful, home to no fewer than 24 different opera companies. By the turn of the century, however, the <a href="New_York_Theatrical_Syndicate" title="wikilink">New York Theatrical Syndicate</a> had grown to dominate the industry throughout the region, and Baltimore became a less common stop for touring companies.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="african-american-music">African American music</h4>
<p>During the 19th century, Maryland had one of the largest populations of free African Americans, totalling one fifth of all free blacks in the country. Baltimore was the center for African American culture and industry, and was home to many African American craftsmen, writers and other professionals, and some of the largest black churches in the country. Many African Americans institutions in Baltimore assisted the less fortunate with food and clothing drives, and other charitable work. The &quot;first instance of mass black assertiveness after the Civil War&quot; in the country occurred in Baltimore in 1865, after a meeting of the <a href="Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows" title="wikilink">Independent Order of Odd Fellows</a> in <a href="Battle_Monument_Square" title="wikilink">Battle Monument Square</a>, marking the anniversary of the <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">Emancipation Proclamation</a>.

He perfected his improvisational piano style, which used <a href="ragtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ragtime</a> riffs, and eventually completed &quot;The Charleston Rag&quot;, in 1899. With compositions like that, Blake pioneered what would eventually become known as the <em><a href="stride" class="uri" title="wikilink">stride</a></em> style by the end of the 1890s; stride later became more closely associated with New York City.

<h5 id="church-music">Church music</h5>
<p>Black churches in Maryland hosted many musical, as well as political and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including <a href="Anne_Brown" title="wikilink">Anne Brown</a>, <a href="Marian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Marian Anderson</a>, <a href="Ethel_Ennis" title="wikilink">Ethel Ennis</a> and <a href="Cab_Calloway" title="wikilink">Cab Calloway</a>, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well-known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with <a href="St._Francis_Academy" title="wikilink">St. Francis Academy</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

Knabe emigrated to the United States in 1831, and he founded the firm, with <a href="Henry_Gaehle" title="wikilink">Henry Gaehle</a>, in 1837. It began manufacturing pianos in 1839. The company became one of the most prominent and respected piano manufacturers in the country, and was the dominant corporation in the Southern market. The company floundered after a fire destroyed a factory, and the aftermath of the Civil War lessened demand in the Southern area where Knabe's sales were concentrated. By the end of the century, however, Knabe's sons, <a href="Ernest_Knabe" title="wikilink">Ernest</a> and William, had re-established the firm as one of the leading piano companies in the country. They built sales in the west and north, and created new designs that made Knabe &amp; Co. the third best-selling piano manufacturer in the country.

<p>Singing schools in Baltimore were few in number until the 1830s.

<p>The introduction of music into Baltimore public schools in 1843 caused a slow decline in the popularity of private youth singing instruction. In response to the growing demand for printed music in schools, publishers began offering collections with evangelical tunes, directed at rural schools. Formal, adult musical institutions, like the Haydn Society and the Euterpe Musical Association, grew in popularity following the Civil War.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

Blake in particular became a <a href="ragtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ragtime</a> legend, and innovator of the <a href="stride" class="uri" title="wikilink">stride</a> style. Later, Baltimore became home to a vibrant jazz scene, producing a number of famous performers, many of them saxophonists. Use of the <a href="Hammond_B-3" title="wikilink">Hammond B-3</a> organ later became an iconic part of <a href="Baltimore_jazz" title="wikilink">Baltimore jazz</a>.

<p>Though the Baltimore Opera Company can be traced back to the 1924 founding of the <a href="Martinet_Opera_School" title="wikilink">Martinet Opera School</a>, the direct antecedent of the Company was founded in 1950, with <a href="Rosa_Ponselle" title="wikilink">Rosa Ponselle</a>, a well-known soprano, as artistic director.

<p>In the early 20th century, Baltimore was home to several African American classically-oriented music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented in large part by the <em><a href="Baltimore_Afro-American" title="wikilink">Baltimore Afro-American</a></em>, a local periodical.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>. Inspired by <a href="A._Jack_Thomas" title="wikilink">A.

Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. <a href="T._Henderson_Kerr" title="wikilink">T. Henderson Kerr</a>, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious <a href="Peabody_Institute" title="wikilink">Peabody Institute</a> debated whether jazz was music at all.

<p>After World War 2, <a href="William_Marbury" title="wikilink">William Marbury</a>, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, began the process of integrating that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including <a href="Anne_Brown" title="wikilink">Anne Brown</a> and <a href="Todd_Duncan" title="wikilink">Todd Duncan</a>, who been the first black performer with the <a href="New_York_City_Opera" title="wikilink">New York City Opera</a> when he was forced to study with <a href="Frank_Bibb" title="wikilink">Frank Bibb</a>, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A.

<p>In the field of 20th century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the development of East Coast <a href="ragtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ragtime</a>, producing the legendary performer and composer <a href="Eubie_Blake" title="wikilink">Eubie Blake</a>. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, and a home for such legends in the field as <a href="Chick_Webb" title="wikilink">Chick Webb</a> and <a href="Billie_Holiday" title="wikilink">Billie Holiday</a>. The city's jazz scene cane be traced to the early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as <em>The Avenue</em>) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for <a href="Eubie_Blake" title="wikilink">Eubie Blake</a> and <a href="Noble_Sissle" title="wikilink">Noble Sissle</a>, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians frequently played on Pennsylvania Avenue on the way to or from engagements in New York.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans from as far away as North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a>, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The single most important venue for outside acts was the <a href="Royal_Theatre_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Royal Theatre</a>, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the <em>Douglass Theater</em>, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the <a href="Earle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earle</a> in Philadelphia, the <a href="Howard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Howard</a> in Washington D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the <a href="Apollo_Theater" title="wikilink">Apollo Theater</a> in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring <a href="Bert_Williams" title="wikilink">Bert Williams</a> resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Major music venues at this time included <a href="Ike_Dixon" title="wikilink">Ike Dixon</a>'s Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by <a href="Charles_Phillip_Tilghman" title="wikilink">Charles Phillip Tilghman</a>, a local businessman.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="Baltimore_Afro-American" title="wikilink">Baltimore Afro-American</a></em> was a prominent African American periodical based in Baltimore in the early to mid 20th century, and the city was home to other black music media.

<p>Baltimore's <a href="Eubie_Blake" title="wikilink">Eubie Blake</a> was one of the most prominent <a href="ragtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ragtime</a> musicians on the East Coast in the early 20th century, and was known for a unique style of piano-playing that eventually became the basis for <a href="stride_piano" title="wikilink">stride</a>, a style perfected during World War I in Harlem. Blake was the most well-known figure in the local scene, and helped make Baltimore one of the ragtime centers of the East Coast, along with Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> He then joined a medicine show, performing throughout Maryland and Pennsylvania before moving to New York in 1902 to play at the <a href="Academy_of_Music_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Academy of Music</a> there. Returning to Baltimore, Blake played at The Saloon, a venue owned by Alfred Greenfield patronized by &quot;colorful characters and 'working' girls&quot;; The Saloon was the basis for his well-known &quot;Corner of Chestnut and Low&quot;.

In 1921, however, the duo received their greatest acclaim with the musical <em><a href="Shuffle_Along" title="wikilink">Shuffle Along</a></em>, the first piece to bring African American jazz and humor to Broadway. The widespread acclaim for <em>Shuffle Along</em> led to changes in the theatre industry nationwide, producing demand for African American performers and leading to newly integrated theatrical companies across the country. When <em>Shuffle Along</em> came to Baltimore's <a href="Ford&#39;s_Theater" title="wikilink">Ford's Theater</a>, Blake struggled to reserve a seat for his mother, because Ford's remained strictly segregated by race.</p>

Chambers was a multi-instrumentalist who founded the <a href="Rivers_Chambers_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Rivers Chambers Orchestra</a> after leaving The Royal, and became a &quot;favorite of Maryland's high society&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> As bandleader of The Royal, Chambers was succeeded by the classically-trained <a href="Tracy_McCleary" title="wikilink">Tracy McCleary</a>, whose band, the <em>Royal Men of Rhythm</em>, included <a href="Charlie_Parker" title="wikilink">Charlie Parker</a> at one point. Many of The Royal's band members would join with touring acts when they came through Baltimore; many had day jobs in the defense industry during World War 2, including McCleary himself. The shortage of musicians during the war led to a relaxation in some aspects of segregation, including in The Royal's band, which began hiring white musicians soon after the war. McCleary would be The Royal's last conductor, however, while Chambers' orchestra became a fixture in Baltimore, and came to include as many as thirty musicians, who would sometimes divide into smaller groups for performances.

<p>In the 1960s, the <a href="Hammond_B-3_organ" title="wikilink">Hammond B-3 organ</a> became a critical part of the Baltimore jazz scene, led by virtuoso <a href="Jimmy_Smith_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jimmy Smith</a>. The Left Bank Jazz Society also played a major role locally, hosting concerts and promoting performers. The popularity of jazz, however, declined greatly by the beginning of the 20th century, with an aging and shrinking audience, though the city continued producing local performers and hosting a vibrant jazz scene.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="doo-wop">Doo wop</h5>
<p>Baltimore was home to a major <a href="doo_wop" title="wikilink">doo wop</a> scene in the middle of the 20th century, which began with <a href="The_Orioles" title="wikilink">The Orioles</a>, who are considered one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore was home to numerous African American vocal groups, and <a href="talent_scout" title="wikilink">talent scouts</a> scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including <a href="The_Cardinals" title="wikilink">The Cardinals</a> and <a href="The_Plants" title="wikilink">The Plants</a>. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of <a href="The_Marylanders" title="wikilink">The Marylanders</a>. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. <a href="Pennsylvania_Avenue" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Avenue</a> served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as <a href="The_Sonnets" title="wikilink">The Sonnets</a>, <a href="The_Jollyjacks" title="wikilink">The Jollyjacks</a>, <a href="The_Honey_Boys" title="wikilink">The Honey Boys</a>, <a href="The_Magictones" title="wikilink">The Magictones</a> and <a href="The_Blentones" title="wikilink">The Blentones</a>, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as <a href="The_Twilighters" title="wikilink">The Twilighters</a> and <a href="The_Four_Buddies" title="wikilink">The Four Buddies</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>It was The Orioles, however, who first developed the city's vocal harmony sound. Originally known as <em>The Vibra-Naires</em>, The Orioles were led by <a href="Sonny_Til" title="wikilink">Sonny Til</a> when they recorded &quot;It's Too Soon to Know&quot;, their first hit and a song that is considered the first doo wop recording of any kind. Doo wop would go on to have a formative influence on the development of <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a>, and The Orioles can be considered the earliest rock and roll band as a result. The Orioles would continue recording until 1954, launching hits like &quot;In the Chapel in the Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Tell Me So&quot; and &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="punk-rock-and-the-modern-scene">Punk, rock and the modern scene</h4>
<p>Baltimore's <a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore punk</a> scene has been overshadowed by that of Washington, DC, but included locally renowned bands like Law &amp; Order, Bollocks, OTR, and Fear of God; many of these bands played at bars like the Marble Bar, Terminal 406 and the illegal space Jules' Loft, which author Steven Blush described as the &quot;apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene&quot; in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local <a href="New_Wave_music" title="wikilink">New Wave</a> scene led by the bands Ebeneezer &amp; the Bludgeons, Thee Katatonix, Alter Legion, and Null Set. Later in the decade, <a href="emo_(music)" title="wikilink">emo</a> bands like <a href="Reptile_House" title="wikilink">Reptile House</a> and <a href="Grey_March" title="wikilink">Grey March</a> had some success and recorded with <a href="Ian_MacKaye" title="wikilink">Ian MacKaye</a> in DC.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved onto other local bands by the end of the 1990s, while local mainstays <a href="Lungfish_(band)" title="wikilink">Lungfish</a> and <a href="Fascist_Fascist" title="wikilink">Fascist Fascist</a> becoming regionally prominent. <em>The Urbanite</em> magazine has indentified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like <a href="Entrance_(musician)" title="wikilink">Entrance</a> and the house/hip hop dance fusion called <a href="Baltimore_club" title="wikilink">Baltimore club</a>, pioneered by DJs like <a href="Rod_Lee" title="wikilink">Rod Lee</a>. More recently, Baltimore's indie rock scene has produced performers like Slot Racer, <a href="Cass_McCombs" title="wikilink">Cass McCombs</a>, <a href="Double_Dagger_(band)" title="wikilink">Double Dagger</a> and <a href="Mary_Prankster" title="wikilink">Mary Prankster</a>, as well as the <a href="Wham_City" title="wikilink">Wham City</a> artist collective.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="media-and-organizations">Media and organizations</h2>
<p>Baltimore's indigenous music media includes the <em><a href="The_City_Paper" title="wikilink">The City Paper</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Baltimore_Sun" title="wikilink">The Baltimore Sun</a></em>, and <em><a href="Music_Monthly" title="wikilink">Music Monthly</a></em>, which frequently advertise local music shows and other events.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The <a href="Baltimore_Blues_Society" title="wikilink">Baltimore Blues Society</a> also distributes one of the more well-renowned blues periodicals in the country.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The <em><a href="Baltimore_Afro-American" title="wikilink">Baltimore Afro-American</a></em>, a local periodical, was one of the most important media in 20th century Baltimore, and documented much of that city's African American musical life.</p>
<p>Baltimore is home to a number of non-profit music organization, most famously including the <a href="Left_Bank_Jazz_Society" title="wikilink">Left Bank Jazz Society</a>, which hosts concerts and otherwise promotes jazz in Baltimore. These non-profits play a greater role in the city's musical life than similar organization do in most other American cities.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The organization <a href="Jazz_in_Cool_Places" title="wikilink">Jazz in Cool Places</a> also works within that genre, presenting performers in architecturally significant locations, such as in a club full of <a href="Tiffany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiffany</a> windows. The <a href="Society_for_the_Preservation_of_American_Roots_Music" title="wikilink">Society for the Preservation of American Roots Music</a> also puts on jazz and blues concerts at its Roots Cafe.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

The <a href="Royal_Theater" title="wikilink">Royal Theater</a>, once one of the premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of <a href="Billie_Holiday" title="wikilink">Billie Holiday</a> remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads <em>I don't think I'm singing.
