<p><strong>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</strong> (<a href="February_27" title="wikilink">February 27</a>, <a href="1807" class="uri" title="wikilink">1807</a> â€“ <a href="March_24" title="wikilink">March 24</a>, <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a>) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a> whose works include &quot;<a href="Paul_Revere&#39;s_Ride" title="wikilink">Paul Revere's Ride</a>&quot;, <em><a href="The_Song_of_Hiawatha" title="wikilink">The Song of Hiawatha</a></em>, and &quot;<a href="Evangeline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Evangeline</a>&quot;. He was also the first American to translate <a href="Dante_Alighieri" title="wikilink">Dante Alighieri's</a> <em><a href="The_Divine_Comedy" title="wikilink">The Divine Comedy</a></em> and was one of the five members of the group known as the <a href="Fireside_Poets" title="wikilink">Fireside Poets</a>.</p>
<p>Longfellow was born in <a href="Portland,_Maine" title="wikilink">Portland, Maine</a> and studied at <a href="Bowdoin_College" title="wikilink">Bowdoin College</a>. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a>. His first major poetry collections were <em>Voices of the Night</em> (1839) and <em>Ballads and Other Poems</em> (1842). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, though he lived the remainder of his life in <a href="Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> in a former headquarters of <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a>.</p>
<p>Longfellow predominantly wrote <a href="lyric_poetry" title="wikilink">lyric poetry</a>, known for its musicality, which often presented stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses.</p>

<p><img src="Longfellow&#39;s_Birthplace,_Portland,_ME.jpg" title="fig:Birthplace in c. 1910" alt="Birthplace in c. 1910" /> Longfellow was born on <a href="February_27" title="wikilink">February 27</a>, <a href="1807" class="uri" title="wikilink">1807</a> to Stephen and Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow in <a href="Portland,_Maine" title="wikilink">Portland, Maine</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he grew up in what is now known as the <a href="Wadsworth-Longfellow_House" title="wikilink">Wadsworth-Longfellow House</a>. His father was a lawyer, and his maternal grandfather, <a href="Peleg_Wadsworth" title="wikilink">Peleg Wadsworth, Sr.</a>, was a general in the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was named after his mother's brother Henry Wadsworth, a Navy lieutenant who died only three years earlier.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Longfellow's siblings were Stephen (1805), Elizabeth (1808), Anne (1810), Alexander (1814), Mary (1816), Ellen (1818), and <a href="Samuel_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Samuel</a> (1819). Henry was enrolled in a <a href="dame_school" title="wikilink">dame school</a> at the age of only three and by age six was enrolled at the private Portland Academy. In his years there, he earned a reputation as being very studious and became fluent in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He printed his first poem &lt;U+2014&gt; a patriotic and historical four stanza poem called &quot;The Battle of Lovell's Pond&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; in the Portland <em>Gazette</em> on <a href="November_17" title="wikilink">November 17</a>, <a href="1820" class="uri" title="wikilink">1820</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He remained at the Portland Academy until the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1822, the 15-year old Longfellow enrolled at <a href="Bowdoin_College" title="wikilink">Bowdoin College</a> in <a href="Brunswick_(town),_Maine" title="wikilink">Brunswick, Maine</a> alongside his brother Stephen.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His grandfather was a founder of the college<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and his father was a trustee.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> There, Longfellow met <a href="Nathaniel_Hawthorne" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>, who would later become his lifelong friend.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He boarded with a clergyman for a time before rooming on the third floor of what is now Maine Hall in 1823.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with <a href="Federalist_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Federalist</a> leanings.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In his senior year, Longfellow wrote to his father about his aspirations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will not disguise it in the least... the fact is, I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature, my whole soul burns most ardently after it, and every earthly thought centres in it... I am almost confident in believing, that if I can ever rise in the world it must be by the exercise of my talents in the wide field of literature.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He pursued his literary goals by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical <em>The United States Literary Gazette</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly <a href="wikt:apocryphal" title="wikilink">apocryphal</a>, is that an influential trustee, <a href="Benjamin_Orr_(Massachusetts_politician)" title="wikilink">Benjamin Orr</a>, had been so by impressed Longfellow's translation of <a href="Horace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horace</a> that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish, and Italian.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Whatever the motivation, he began his tour of Europe in May 1826 aboard the ship <em>Cadmus</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> His time abroad would last three years and cost his father an estimated $2,604.24.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He traveled to France, Spain, Italy, Germany, back to France, then England before returning to the United States in mid-August 1829.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> While in Madrid, he spent time with <a href="Washington_Irving" title="wikilink">Washington Irving</a> and was encouraged by the author to write.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Longfellow was saddened to learn his favorite sister Elizabeth had died of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> at the age of 20 that May while he was abroad.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="August_27" title="wikilink">August 27</a>, <a href="1829" class="uri" title="wikilink">1829</a>, he wrote to the president of Bowdoin that he was turning down the professorship because he considered the $600 salary &quot;disproportionate to the duties required.&quot; The trustees raised his salary to $800 with an additional $100 to serve as the college's librarian, a post which required one hour of work per day.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During his years at the college, he wrote textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish and a travel book, <em>Outre-Mer: A Pilgrimage Beyond the Sea</em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On <a href="September_14" title="wikilink">September 14</a>, <a href="1831" class="uri" title="wikilink">1831</a>, he married Mary Storer Potter, a childhood friend from Portland.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The couple settled in Brunswick, though the two were not happy there.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 1834, Longfellow received a letter from <a href="Josiah_Quincy_III" title="wikilink">Josiah Quincy III</a>, president of <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a>, offering him a position as the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages with the stipulation that he spend a year or so abroad.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In October 1835, during the trip, his wife Mary had a miscarriage about six months into her pregnancy.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> She did not recover and died after several weeks of illness at the age of 22 on <a href="November_29" title="wikilink">November 29</a>, <a href="1835" class="uri" title="wikilink">1835</a>. Longfellow had her body embalmed immediately and placed into a lead coffin inside an oak coffin which was then shipped to <a href="Mount_Auburn_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> near Boston.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Three years later, he was inspired to write &quot;Footsteps of Angels&quot; about their love. Several years later, he wrote the poem &quot;Mezzo Cammin&quot; to express his sorrow over her death.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>. He was required to live in Cambridge to be close to the campus and moved in to the Craigie House in the spring of 1837,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> now preserved as the <a href="Longfellow_National_Historic_Site" title="wikilink">Longfellow National Historic Site</a>.

<h3 id="courtship-of-frances-fanny-appleton">Courtship of Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Appleton</h3>
<p><img src="Fanny_Appleton_Longfellow_Drawing.jpeg" title="fig:After a seven-year courtship, Longfellow married Frances Appleton in 1843." alt="After a seven-year courtship, Longfellow married Frances Appleton in 1843." /> Longfellow began courting Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Appleton, the daughter of a wealthy Boston industrialist, <a href="Nathan_Appleton" title="wikilink">Nathan Appleton</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> At first, she was not interested but Longfellow was determined. In July 1839, he wrote to a friend: &quot;[V]ictory hangs doubtful. The lady says she <em>will not</em>! I say she <em>shall</em>! It is not <em>pride</em>, but the madness of passion.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> During the courtship, he frequently walked from Harvard to her home in Boston, crossing the Boston Bridge. That bridge was subsequently demolished and replaced in 1906 by a new bridge, which was eventually renamed the <a href="Longfellow_Bridge" title="wikilink">Longfellow Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>During his courtship, Longfellow continued writing and, in the fall of 1839, published <em>Hyperion</em>, a book of travel writings discussing his trips abroad.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1843, he also published a play, <em>The Spanish Student</em>, reflecting his memories from his time in Spain in the 1820s.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> There was some confusion over its original manuscript. After being printed in <em><a href="Graham&#39;s_Magazine" title="wikilink">Graham's Magazine</a></em>, its editor <a href="Rufus_Wilmot_Griswold" title="wikilink">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a> saved the manuscript from the trash. Longfellow was surprised to hear that it had been saved, unusual for a printing office, and asked to borrow it so that he could revise it, forgetting to return it to Griswold. The often vindictive Griswold wrote an angry letter in response.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="May_10" title="wikilink">May 10</a>, <a href="1843" class="uri" title="wikilink">1843</a>, after seven years, Longfellow received a letter from Fanny agreeing to marry him and, too restless to take a carriage, walked 90 minutes to meet her at her house.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> They were married shortly thereafter. Nathan Appleton bought the Craigie House as a wedding present to the pair. Longfellow would live there for the remainder of his life.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> His love for Fanny is evident in the following lines from Longfellow's only love poem, the sonnet &quot;The Evening Star&quot;,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> which he wrote in October, 1845: &quot;O my beloved, my sweet Hesperus! My morning and my evening star of love!&quot;</p>
<p>He and Fanny had six children: Charles Appleton (1844-1893), Ernest Wadsworth (1845-1921), Fanny (1847-1848), Alice Mary (1850-1928), Edith (1853-1915), and Anne Allegra (1855-1934). Their second-youngest daughter, Edith, married Richard Henry Dana III, son of the popular poet <a href="Richard_Henry_Dana" title="wikilink">Richard Henry Dana</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> When the younger Fanny was born on <a href="April_7" title="wikilink">April 7</a>, <a href="1847" class="uri" title="wikilink">1847</a>, Dr. <a href="Nathan_Cooley_Keep" title="wikilink">Nathan Cooley Keep</a> administered <a href="ether" class="uri" title="wikilink">ether</a> as the first obstetric <a href="anesthesia" title="wikilink">anesthetic</a> in the United States to Fanny Longfellow.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> A few months later, on <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a>, <a href="1847" class="uri" title="wikilink">1847</a>, the poem &quot;<a href="Evangeline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Evangeline</a>&quot; was published for the first time.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="June_14" title="wikilink">June 14</a>, <a href="1853" class="uri" title="wikilink">1853</a>, Longfellow held a farewell dinner party at his Cambridge home for his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was preparing to move overseas.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Shortly thereafter in 1854, Longfellow retired from Harvard,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> devoting himself entirely to writing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of Laws from Harvard in 1859.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="death-of-frances">Death of Frances</h3>
<p>On a hot July day, Fanny was putting locks of her children's hair into an envelope and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> it may have been burning wax or a lighted candle which fell on her dress.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Longfellow, awoken from his nap, rushed to help her and threw a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Over a half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming that there was no candle or wax but the fire started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In both versions of the story, however, Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She was in and out of consciousness throughout the night and was administered <a href="ether" class="uri" title="wikilink">ether</a>. The next morning, <a href="July_10" title="wikilink">July 10</a>, <a href="1861" class="uri" title="wikilink">1861</a>, she died shortly after 10 o'clock after requesting a cup of coffee.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough that he was unable to attend her funeral.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> His own injuries to his face were bad enough that he stopped shaving, thereafter wearing the beard which has become his trademark.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Devastated by her death, he never fully recovered and occasionally resorted to <a href="laudanum" class="uri" title="wikilink">laudanum</a> and ether to deal with it.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He expressed his grief in the sonnet &quot;The Cross of Snow&quot; (1879), which he wrote eighteen years later to commemorate her death:<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Longfellow spent several years translating <a href="Dante_Alighieri" title="wikilink">Dante Alighieri's</a> <em><a href="Divine_Comedy" title="wikilink">Divine Comedy</a></em>. To aid him in perfecting the translation and reviewing proofs, he invited friends to weekly meetings every Wednesday starting in 1864.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The &quot;Dante Club&quot;, as it was called, regularly included <a href="William_Dean_Howells" title="wikilink">William Dean Howells</a>, <a href="James_Russell_Lowell" title="wikilink">James Russell Lowell</a>, <a href="Charles_Eliot_Norton" title="wikilink">Charles Eliot Norton</a> and other occasional guests.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1882, Longfellow went to bed with severe stomach pain. He endured the pain for several days with the help of <a href="opium" class="uri" title="wikilink">opium</a> before he died surrounded by family on Friday, <a href="March_24" title="wikilink">March 24</a>, <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He had been suffering from <a href="peritonitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">peritonitis</a>.

<p>Longfellow often used <a href="allegory" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegory</a> in his work. In &quot;Nature&quot;, for example, death is depicted as bedtime for a cranky child.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Many of the <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphors</a> he used in his poetry as well as subject matter came from legends, mythology, and literature.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He was inspired, for example, by <a href="Norse_mythology" title="wikilink">Norse mythology</a> for &quot;<a href="The_Skeleton_in_Armor" title="wikilink">The Skeleton in Armor</a>&quot; and by Finnish legends for &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In fact, Longfellow rarely wrote on current subjects and seemed detached from contemporary American concerns.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Though he often used <a href="didacticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">didacticism</a> in his poetry, he focused on it less in his later years.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Much of his work is recognized for its melody-like musicality.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Though much of his work is categorized as <a href="lyric_poetry" title="wikilink">lyric poetry</a>, he occasionally experimented with form, trying <a href="hexameter" class="uri" title="wikilink">hexameter</a> and <a href="free_verse" title="wikilink">free verse</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He was also important as a translator; his translation of Dante became a required possession for those who wanted to be a part of high culture.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>
<p>Longfellow's early collections, <em>Voices of the Night</em> and <em>Ballads and Other Poems</em>, made him instantly popular. The <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em> called him &quot;one of the very few in our time who has successfully aimed in putting poetry to its best and sweetest uses.&quot; The <em><a href="Southern_Literary_Messenger" title="wikilink">Southern Literary Messenger</a></em> immediately put Longfellow &quot;among the first of our American poets.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The rapidity with which American readers embraced Longfellow was unparalleled in publishing history in the United States.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> In the last two decades of his life, he often received requests for autographs from strangers, which he always sent.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

He had become one of the first American celebrities and was also popular in Europe. It was reported that 10,000 copies of <em>The Courtship of Miles Standish</em> sold in London in a single day.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In 1884 he was the first and only American poet for whom a commemorative sculpted bust was placed in <a href="Poet&#39;s_Corner" title="wikilink">Poet's Corner</a> of <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.</p>
