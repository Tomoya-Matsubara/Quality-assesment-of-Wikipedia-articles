<p><strong>J. Woodland (&lt;U+201C&gt;Woody&lt;U+201D&gt;) Hastings</strong> (born on March 24, 1927 in New Jersey) is a leader in the field of <a href="photobiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">photobiology</a>, especially <a href="bioluminescence" class="uri" title="wikilink">bioluminescence</a>, and is one of the founders of the field of circadian biology (<a href="circadian_rhythms" title="wikilink">circadian rhythms</a>). He is the Paul C. Mangelsdorf Professor of Natural Sciences (Emeritus) in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He has published over 400 papers and co-edited three books.</p>
<p>Hastings research on bioluminescence has principally focused on bacterial luminescence (over 150 papers) and <a href="dinoflagellates" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinoflagellates</a> (over 80 papers).

<h2 id="his-career">His Career</h2>
<p><strong>1948-1951</strong>: Hastings began his graduate studies at <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a> (Princeton, NJ) in 1948 in the laboratory of E. Newton Harvey, the world leader of luminescence studies at the time, and focused on the role of oxygen in the luminescence of bacteria, fireflies, ostracod crustaceans and fungi. He received his PhD in 1951.</p>
<p><strong>1951-1953</strong>: He then joined the lab of William D. McElroy, another student of Harvey&lt;U+2019&gt;s, at <a href="Johns_Hopkins_University" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins University</a> (Baltimore, MD) where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of <a href="coenzyme_A" title="wikilink">coenzyme A</a> and gating control by <a href="oxygen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> of firefly luminescence, and that <a href="flavin" class="uri" title="wikilink">flavin</a> is a substrate in bacterial luminescence.</p>
<p><strong>1953-1957</strong>: In 1953 he joined the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences at <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> (Evanston, IL). In 1954 he began a long collaboration with Beatrice Sweeney, who was then at the <a href="Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography" title="wikilink">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> (La Jolla, CA), in elucidating the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of luminescence in the unicellular dinoflagellate <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum</em> (formerly <em>Gonyaulax polyedra</em>). A byproduct of this initial research was their discovery of circadian control of the luminescence.</p>
<p><strong>1957-1966</strong>: Hastings next took a faculty position in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the <a href="University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana&lt;U+2013&gt;Champaign" title="wikilink">University of Illinois at Urbana&lt;U+2013&gt;Champaign</a> (Urbana, IL) where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate circadian rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>1966-present</strong>: Hastings joined the faculty of Harvard University as Professor of Biology in 1966 and where he remains as an emeritus professor. During this period he continued and expanded his studies of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms in 2006.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>For over 50 years he has also had an affiliation with the <a href="Marine_Biological_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> in Woods Hole, MA. He was the director of the Physiology Course there from 1962-.1966, and served as a trustee from 1966-1970.</p>
<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>
<p><strong>Luminescent Bacteria</strong>: Hastings investigations of luminous bacteria have led not only to basic discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production, the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its <a href="luciferase" class="uri" title="wikilink">luciferase</a> reaction, the determination of gene regulation of the luciferases, but also the first evidence for quorum sensing, a form of bacterial communication. In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release into the medium a substance, the autoinducer, that, once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level, which is a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area, <a href="transcription" class="uri" title="wikilink">transcription</a> of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in <a href="gram-negative_bacteria" title="wikilink">gram-negative bacteria</a> quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. Now we know that, like the luciferase proteins, in many pathogenic bacteria there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defenses of the host.</p>
<p><strong>Luminescent Dinoflagellates</strong>: Beginning in 1954 at Northwestern University Hastings and his students and colleagues have been studying cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [especially <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum</em> (formerly <em>Gonyaulax polyedra</em>)]. They have been elucidating the structures of the <a href="luciferin" title="wikilink">luciferins</a> and <a href="luciferases" class="uri" title="wikilink">luciferases</a>, the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms, and the actual subcellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons. They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in <a href="pH" class="uri" title="wikilink">pH</a> when an <a href="action_potential" title="wikilink">action potential</a> leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons. Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 &lt;U+03BC&gt;m) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein. Recently their lab has found that the luciferase gene in <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum</em> and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences in a kind of &lt;U+201C&gt;three-ring circus with the same act in all three.&lt;U+201D&gt; However, another luminescent, but <a href="heterotrophic" class="uri" title="wikilink">heterotrophic</a>, dinoflagellate, <em>Noctiluca scintillans</em>, has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Dinoflagellate Circadian Rhythms</strong>: Using <em>Lingulodinium polyedrum</em> as a model, Hastings has spear-headed our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of circadian rhythms, which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities. His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins. Because the <a href="mRNA" title="wikilink">mRNAs</a> that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the <a href="translational" class="uri" title="wikilink">translational</a> level. This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell. On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the circadian rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered. At still another level, <a href="protein_phosphorylation" title="wikilink">protein phosphorylation</a> inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>Other luminescent systems</strong>: Early in his career Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work when he was in the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (<a href="aequorin" class="uri" title="wikilink">aequorin</a>), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. <a href="Osamu_Shimomura" title="wikilink">Osamu Shimomura</a>, <a href="Martin_Chalfie" title="wikilink">Martin Chalfie</a> and <a href="Roger_Tsien" title="wikilink">Roger Tsien</a> received the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.</p>
