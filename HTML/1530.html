<p><strong>William Franklin</strong> &quot;<strong>Billy</strong>&quot; <strong>Graham, Jr.</strong> (born November 7, 1918) is an American <a href="evangelical_Christian" title="wikilink">evangelical Christian</a> <a href="Evangelism" title="wikilink">evangelist</a>, ordained as a Southern Baptist minister, who rose to celebrity status with national media backing of <a href="William_Randolph_Hearst" title="wikilink">William Randolph Hearst</a> and <a href="Henry_Luce" title="wikilink">Henry Luce</a> in 1949. His <a href="sermon" title="wikilink">sermons</a> were broadcast on radio and television.</p>
<p>Graham is notable for having been a spiritual adviser to several <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Presidents</a>; he was particularly close to <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and <a href="Richard_M._Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard M. Nixon</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During the <a href="African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955&lt;U+2013&gt;1968)" title="wikilink">civil rights movement</a>, he began to support integrated seating for his revivals and crusades; in 1957 he invited Rev. <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> to jointly preach at a huge revival in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, where they appeared together at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>, and bailed the minister out of jail in the 1960s when he was arrested in demonstrations.</p>
<p>Having built an evangelical empire and organized huge events worldwide, Graham has personally preached <a href="Good_news_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">the Gospel</a> to more people than any other person in history. His institutions include a variety of media and publishing outlets.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> According to his staff, more than 3.2 million people have responded to the invitation at Billy Graham Crusades to accept <a href="Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> as their personal Savior. As of 2008, Graham's estimated lifetime audience, including radio and television broadcasts, topped 2.2 billion.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>With his renown and international travel, Graham has repeatedly been on <a href="Gallup&#39;s_most_admired_man_and_woman_poll" title="wikilink">Gallup's list of most admired men and women</a>, and in 1999 was ranked as number seven for the 20th century.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Named after his father and born November 7, 1918, he is the first son of Morrow Coffey (1892&lt;U+2013&gt;1981) and William Franklin Graham, Sr. (1888&lt;U+2013&gt;1962); he grew up on the family dairy farm farm near <a href="Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. Called Billy, he was raised in the <a href="Associate_Reformed_Presbyterian_Church" title="wikilink">Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church</a> by his parents and was of Scottish descent.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1933, when <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Prohibition in the United States</a> ended, Graham's father forced Billy and his sister Katherine to drink beer until they got sick, which created such an aversion that both avoided alcohol and drugs the rest of their lives.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>After Graham was turned down for membership in a local youth group because he was &quot;too worldly,&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded the youth to go see <a href="Mordecai_Ham" title="wikilink">Mordecai Ham</a>, an evangelist.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> According to his autobiography, Graham was converted in 1934 at age 16 during a series of revival meetings in Charlotte led by the evangelist.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended <a href="Bob_Jones_University" title="wikilink">Bob Jones College</a>, located in <a href="Cleveland,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Tennessee</a>. After one semester, he found it too legalistic in both coursework and rules.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At this time, he was influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but <a href="Bob_Jones,_Sr." title="wikilink">Bob Jones, Sr.</a> warned him not to throw his life away: &quot;At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks.... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now <a href="Trinity_College_(Florida)" title="wikilink">Trinity College of Florida</a>). (Today's <a href="Florida_College" title="wikilink">Florida College</a> is now located at that site in <a href="Temple_Terrace,_Florida" title="wikilink">Temple Terrace, Florida</a>.) In his autobiography, Graham wrote of receiving his &quot;calling on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club,&quot; which is immediately in front of today's Sutton Hall at Florida College. Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was established on the <a href="Hillsborough_River" title="wikilink">Hillsborough River</a> directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. Graham eventually graduated from <a href="Wheaton_College_(Illinois)" title="wikilink">Wheaton College</a> in <a href="Wheaton,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Wheaton, Illinois</a> with a degree in <a href="anthropology" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropology</a> in 1943.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>It was during his time at Wheaton that Graham decided to accept the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> as the <a href="infallibility" title="wikilink">infallible</a> word of God. <a href="Henrietta_Mears" title="wikilink">Henrietta Mears</a> of the <a href="First_Presbyterian_Church_of_Hollywood_(Hollywood,_California)" title="wikilink">First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood (Hollywood, California)</a> was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the <a href="Big_Bear_Lake,_California" title="wikilink">Big Bear area</a> in <a href="Southern_California" title="wikilink">Southern California</a>. A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.</p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>On August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate <a href="Ruth_Graham" title="wikilink">Ruth Bell</a> (1920&lt;U+2013&gt;2007), whose parents were <a href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> <a href="missionary" title="wikilink">missionaries</a> in <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a>. Her father <a href="L._Nelson_Bell" title="wikilink">L. Nelson Bell</a> was a general surgeon. Graham met Ruth at Wheaton: &quot;I saw her walking down the road towards me and I couldn't help but stare at her as she walked. She looked at me and our eyes met and I felt that she was definitely the woman I wanted to marry.&quot; Ruth thought that he &quot;wanted to please God more than any man I'd ever met.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> They married two months after graduation and later lived in a <a href="log_cabin" title="wikilink">log cabin</a> designed by Ruth in the <a href="Blue_Ridge_Mountains" title="wikilink">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> in <a href="Montreat,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Montreat, North Carolina</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at the age of 87.</p>
<p>They had five children together: Virginia Leftwich (Gigi) Graham Tchividjian (born 1945); <a href="Anne_Graham_Lotz" title="wikilink">Anne Graham Lotz</a> (born 1948; runs AnGeL ministries); Ruth Graham (born 1950; founder and president of Ruth Graham &amp; Friends); <a href="Franklin_Graham" title="wikilink">Franklin Graham</a> (born 1952; administers an international relief organization called <a href="Samaritan&#39;s_Purse" title="wikilink">Samaritan's Purse</a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and will be his father's successor at the <a href="Billy_Graham_Evangelistic_Association" title="wikilink">Billy Graham Evangelistic Association</a>); and Nelson Edman Graham (born 1958; a pastor who runs East Gates International,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which distributes Christian literature in China.) Graham has 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren. His grandson <a href="Tullian_Tchividjian" title="wikilink">Tullian Tchividjian</a> is senior pastor of <a href="Coral_Ridge_Presbyterian_Church" title="wikilink">Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church</a> in <a href="Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida" title="wikilink">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure no one mistook his actions, Graham had a policy to avoid being alone with any woman other than his wife Ruth. This has come to be known as the Billy Graham Rule.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>While attending college, Graham became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.</p>
<p>Graham served briefly as pastor of the Village Church in <a href="Western_Springs,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Western Springs, Illinois</a>, not far from Wheaton, in 1943-44. While there, his friend <a href="Torrey_Johnson" title="wikilink">Torrey Johnson</a>, pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, told Graham that his radio program &quot;Songs in the Night&quot; was about to be canceled for lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his parishioners. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called <em>Songs in the Night</em>, Graham recruited the <a href="baritone" class="uri" title="wikilink">baritone</a> <a href="George_Beverly_Shea" title="wikilink">George Beverly Shea</a> as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945. In 1947, at age 30, he was hired as president of <a href="Northwestern_College_(Minnesota)" title="wikilink">Northwestern Bible College</a> in <a href="St._Paul,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>, the youngest person to serve as college president. Graham served as the president of Northwestern Bible College from 1948 to 1952.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Initially, Graham intended to become a <a href="chaplain" class="uri" title="wikilink">chaplain</a> in the <a href="armed_forces" title="wikilink">armed forces</a> but, shortly after applying for a commission, contracted <a href="mumps" class="uri" title="wikilink">mumps</a>. After a period of recuperation in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, Graham was hired as the first full-time <a href="evangelism" title="wikilink">evangelist</a> of the new <a href="Youth_for_Christ_International" title="wikilink">Youth for Christ International</a> (YFCI), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist <a href="Charles_Templeton" title="wikilink">Charles Templeton</a>. Graham traveled throughout both the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> as an YFCI evangelist. Unlike many evangelists, Graham had little formal theological training. Templeton applied to <a href="Princeton_Theological_Seminary" title="wikilink">Princeton Theological Seminary</a> for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but the evangelist declined. He was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hearst-bubble">Hearst bubble</h3>
<p>Graham scheduled a series of <a href="revival_meeting" title="wikilink">revival meetings</a> in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> in 1949, for which he erected <a href="circus" class="uri" title="wikilink">circus</a> tents in a parking lot.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He was given national coverage by the news mogul <a href="William_Randolph_Hearst" title="wikilink">William Randolph Hearst</a>. Scholars such as Ben Bagdikian believe that Hearst liked Graham's patriotism and appeals to youth; he thought the evangelist would help promote Hearst's conservative anti-communist views.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The scholar Randall E. King notes that Hearst and Graham never met.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Hearst sent a <a href="telegraphy" title="wikilink">telegram</a> to his newspaper editors: &quot;Puff Graham&quot; during the Los Angeles crusade and within five days, he gained national coverage.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> With such media attention, the crusade event ran for eight weeks&lt;U+2014&gt;five weeks longer than planned. Graham became a national figure.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <a href="Henry_Luce" title="wikilink">Henry Luce</a> also promoted Graham with coverage at this time, and by 1954 featured him on the cover of his magazine <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">TIME</a></em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crusades">Crusades</h3>
<p>Billy Graham has conducted many revivals since 1948 and in the next decade, began to call them crusades, after the medieval Christian forces who tried to conquer Jerusalem. In 1959, he led his first crusade, which was in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions got larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the <a href="gospel" class="uri" title="wikilink">gospel</a> and invite people to come forward (a practice begun by <a href="Dwight_L._Moody" title="wikilink">Dwight L. Moody</a>). Such people were called inquirers and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor, to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the <a href="Gospel_of_John" title="wikilink">Gospel of John</a> or a <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> study booklet. In <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During his crusades, he has frequently used the <a href="altar_call" title="wikilink">altar call</a> song, &quot;<a href="Just_as_I_Am_(hymn)#Altar_Song_in_the_Billy_Graham_crusades" title="wikilink">Just As I Am</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Graham was offered a five-year, $5 million contract from <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> to appear on television opposite <a href="Arthur_Godfrey" title="wikilink">Arthur Godfrey</a>, but he turned it down in favor of continuing his touring revivals because of his prearranged commitments.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Graham had missions in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, which lasted 12 weeks, and a <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> mission in <a href="Madison_Square_Garden_(1925)" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a> in 1957, which ran nightly for 16 weeks.</p>
<h4 id="billy-graham-evangelistic-association">Billy Graham Evangelistic Association</h4>
<p>In 1950, Graham founded the <a href="Billy_Graham_Evangelistic_Association" title="wikilink">Billy Graham Evangelistic Association</a> with its headquarters in <a href="Minneapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a>. The association later relocated to <a href="Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. BGEA Ministries have included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Hour_of_Decision" title="wikilink">Hour of Decision</a></em>, a weekly radio program broadcast around the world for more than 50 years</li>
<li>Mission television specials broadcast in almost every market in the US and Canada</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="civil-rights-movement">Civil rights movement</h4>
<p><img src="Billy_Graham_&amp;_Martin_Luther_King.jpg" title="fig:Graham with Martin Luther King" alt="Graham with Martin Luther King" /> Graham had shown little concern for <a href="racial_segregation" title="wikilink">segregation</a> until the <a href="African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955&lt;U+2013&gt;1968)" title="wikilink">civil rights movement</a> began to receive national attention in the early 1950s. Many of his early crusades were segregated. In response to the civil rights movement, Graham began to adjust his approach but was inconsistent, refusing to speak in some segregated auditoriums, while speaking to segregated audiences at others. In 1953 he tore down the ropes that organizers had erected to separate the audience into racial sections; he recounted in his memoirs that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down &quot;or you can go on and have the revival without me.&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> But, he later acceded to segregated seating at <a href="Dallas,_Texas" title="wikilink">Dallas, Texas</a> and <a href="Asheville,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Asheville, North Carolina</a>. He sometimes preached that the Bible said nothing about segregation,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> but another time warned a white audience, &quot;we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> After the 1954 <a href="US_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">US Supreme Court</a> ruling in <em><a href="Brown_v._Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em> that public school segregation was unconstitutional, Graham insisted on integrated seating at his revivals. His inconsistent approach in the early years has led to differing assessments by historians of his career and complicated his legacy.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>From the mid-1950s on, Graham became increasingly opposed to segregation and racism, while keeping his eye on public opinion. For instance, in 1957 he invited Rev. <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3 million gathered at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>, <a href="Yankee_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a>, and <a href="Times_Square" title="wikilink">Times Square</a> to hear them.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Graham never appeared publicly again with King, but he posted bail for the minister to get him released from jail in 1963 during the <a href="African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955&lt;U+2013&gt;1968)" title="wikilink">civil rights protests</a> in Birmingham.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Graham's faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation; the minister told one member of the <a href="KKK" class="uri" title="wikilink">KKK</a> that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons: &quot;there is no scriptural basis for segregation,&quot; Graham argued, &quot;The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced <a href="apartheid" class="uri" title="wikilink">apartheid</a>. <embed src="Billy_Graham_in_het_Feyenoord_stadion.ogg" title="fig:Billy Graham at the Feyenoord-stadion in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (June 30, 1955)" /> In 1984, he led a series of summer meetings in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, called Mission England, using outdoor football grounds as venues.</p>
<p>Graham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time.

<p>Graham said that his planned <a href="retirement" class="uri" title="wikilink">retirement</a> was because of his failing health.

Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. <a href="Ruth_Graham" title="wikilink">Ruth Graham</a> had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains near <a href="Asheville,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Novelist <a href="Patricia_Cornwell" title="wikilink">Patricia Cornwell</a>, a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction.

When <em>Newsweek</em> asked Graham whether ministers&lt;U+2014&gt;whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both&lt;U+2014&gt;should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord.
