It is a building in <a href="Neoclassical_architecture" title="wikilink">neoclassical</a> style which contains concert halls and law courts, and is a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the east side of the hall, between it and the railway station is St George's Plateau and on the west side are <a href="St_John&#39;s_Gardens" title="wikilink">St John's Gardens</a>. The hall is included in the <a href="William_Brown_Street" title="wikilink">William Brown Street</a> conservation area.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1969 <a href="Nikolaus_Pevsner" title="wikilink">Pevsner</a> expressed his opinion that it is one of the finest <a href="Greek_Revival" title="wikilink">neo-Grecian</a> buildings in the world<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> although the building is notable for its use of <a href="Roman_architecture" title="wikilink">Roman</a> sources as well as Greek ones. In 2004 the hall and its surrounding area were recognised as part of <a href="Liverpool_Maritime_Mercantile_City" title="wikilink">Liverpool's World Heritage Site</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The site of the hall was formerly occupied by the first <a href="Liverpool_Infirmary" title="wikilink">Liverpool Infirmary</a> from 1749 to 1824. Triennial music festivals were held in the city but there was no suitable hall to accommodate them.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Following a public meeting in 1836 a company was formed to raise subscriptions for a hall in Liverpool to be used for the festivals, and for meetings, dinners and concerts.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Shares were made available at &lt;U+00A3&gt;25 each and by January 1837 &lt;U+00A3&gt;23,350 had been raised. In 1838 the <a href="cornerstone" title="wikilink">foundation stone</a> was laid to commemorate the <a href="coronation" class="uri" title="wikilink">coronation</a> of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A competition in 1839 to design the hall was won by <a href="Harvey_Lonsdale_Elmes" title="wikilink">Harvey Lonsdale Elmes</a>, a London architect aged 25 years. There was a need for assize courts in the city and a competition to design these was also won by Elmes. The original plan was to have separate buildings but in 1840 Elmes suggested that both functions could be combined in one building on a scale which would surpass most of the other public buildings in the country at the time. Construction started in 1841, the building opened in 1854 (with the small concert room opening two years later). Elmes died in 1847 and the work was continued by John Weightman, Corporation Surveyor, and <a href="Robert_Rawlinson" title="wikilink">Robert Rawlinson</a>, structural engineer, until in 1851 Sir <a href="Charles_Robert_Cockerell" title="wikilink">Charles Cockerell</a> was appointed architect. Cockerell was largely responsible for the decoration of the interiors.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> During the 2000s a major restoration of the hall took place costing &lt;U+00A3&gt;23m and it was officially reopened on <a href="23_April" title="wikilink">23 April</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> by <a href="Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">HRH Prince of Wales</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="interior">Interior</h3>
<p>The main entrance crosses a corridor and leads into the Concert Hall. This measures  by  and is  high. The roof is a <a href="Barrel_vault" title="wikilink">tunnel vault</a> carried on columns of polished red <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a>. The walls have <a href="Niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niches</a> for statues and the panelled plasterwork of the vault has <a href="allegory" title="wikilink">allegorical</a> figures of Virtues, Science and Arts. The highly decorated floor consists of <a href="Mintons_Ltd" title="wikilink">Minton</a> tiles and it is usually covered by a removable floor to protect it.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It contains over 30,000 tiles.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The doors are <a href="bronze" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronze</a> and have openwork panels which incorporate the letters SPQL (the Senate and the People of Liverpool) making an association with the <a href="SPQR" class="uri" title="wikilink">SPQR</a> badge of ancient <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Rome</a>. The organ is at the north end and at the south end is a round arch supporting an entablature between whose columns is a gate leading directly into the Crown Court.

Air was warmed by five hot water pipes which were heated by two coke-fired boilers and two steam boilers. The air was circulated by four  wide fans. It was controlled a large number of workers opening and closing a series of canvas flaps.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="organ">Organ</h2>
<p>This was built by <a href="Henry_Willis" title="wikilink">Henry Willis</a> and completed in 1855 with 100 speaking <a href="Organ_stop" title="wikilink">stops</a> across four manual divisions (of non-standard compass, 63 notes GG to a) and pedals (30 notes). It comprised a total of 119 ranks of pipes, plus 10 couplers, 10 composition pedals, and 36 pistons to set combinations of stops. It was initially tuned to <a href="meantone_temperament" title="wikilink">meantone temperament</a> to the specification of <a href="Samuel_Sebastian_Wesley" title="wikilink">S. S. Wesley</a> but in 1867 W. T. Best, city organist, retuned it to <a href="equal_temperament" title="wikilink">equal temperament</a>. The organ was rebuilt in 1896 when the key action was changed from the Willis-Barker lever assisted tracker (i.e. pneumatic assisted mechanical) action to pneumatic action. Also the manual compass was changed to the now standard CC to c, 61 notes, making the bottom 5 pipes on every manual stop redundant.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1931 it was reconstructed by Henry Willis III when the number of stops was increased to 120 and <a href="electro-pneumatic_action" title="wikilink">electro-pneumatic action</a> introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1979 it was given a general clean and overhaul by Henry Willis IV. The total number of <a href="Registration_(organ)" title="wikilink">registers</a>, including 24 <a href="coupler" title="wikilink">couplers</a>, is 144.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> With 7,737 pipes, it was the largest organ in the country until a larger one was built at the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a> in 1871, after which an organ even larger than the one at the Royal Albert Hall was constructed at <a href="Liverpool_Anglican_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Liverpool Anglican Cathedral</a>, untilising over 10,000 pipes.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As part of the 2000–2007 restoration of the hall repairs were made to the organ, including replacement of the <a href="bellows" class="uri" title="wikilink">bellows</a> leather.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The organ is maintained by David Wells, Organ Builders.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="St_Georges_Hall.jpg" title="fig:Main Entrance to the Hall" alt="Main Entrance to the Hall" width="200" /></p>
