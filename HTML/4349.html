<p><strong>Geoffrey Henry Cecil Bing</strong> (24 July 1909 – 24 April 1977) was a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> barrister and politician who served as the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a> <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Hornchurch_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Hornchurch</a> from 1945 to 1955.</p>
<p>Born at Craigavad near <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a>, Bing was educated at <a href="Tonbridge_School" title="wikilink">Tonbridge School</a> before going on to <a href="Lincoln_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Lincoln College, Oxford</a>, where he read history. He was <a href="called_to_the_Bar" title="wikilink">called to the Bar</a> from the <a href="Inner_Temple" title="wikilink">Inner Temple</a> in 1934.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Always a <a href="Far_left" title="wikilink">radical</a> and a member of the <a href="socialism" title="wikilink">socialist left</a>, Bing was active in the Haldane Society and the <a href="National_Council_for_Civil_Liberties" title="wikilink">National Council for Civil Liberties</a>. During the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>, he joined the <a href="International_Brigades" title="wikilink">International Brigades</a> as a journalist, barely avoiding capture at <a href="Bilbao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bilbao</a>. He was also an early anti-Nazi.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, he served in the <a href="Royal_Corps_of_Signals" title="wikilink">Royal Signals</a>, attaining the rank of <a href="major" class="uri" title="wikilink">major</a>. A 1943 experiment with parachutes at the GSO2 Airborne Forces Development Centre left him disfigured and he bore the scars for many years.</p>
<p>At the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="wikilink">1945 general election</a>, Bing stood for Labour in Hornchurch, winning the seat. He was re-elected in <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950" title="wikilink">1950</a> and <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1951" title="wikilink">1951</a>, serving until 1955. He served briefly as a junior <a href="Whip_(politics)" title="wikilink">whip</a> in 1945-6 but this was widely thought to have been the unintended result of confusion on <a href="Clement_Attlee" title="wikilink">Clement Attlee</a>'s part, who confused him for another Labour MP of a similar name.</p>
<h2 id="backbencher">Backbencher</h2>
<p>On the <a href="backbencher" title="wikilink">backbenches</a>, Bing was, according to his <em>Times</em> obituary:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>the unrestrained leader of a small group of radicals, never fully trusted by their colleagues and known as &quot;Bing Boys&quot;.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He took a particular interest in the cases of <a href="Timothy_Evans" title="wikilink">Timothy Evans</a> and <a href="John_Christie" title="wikilink">John Christie</a>, and he supported the campaign to overturn the conviction of Evans, which was ultimately successful. He supported Communist China and took a keen interest in <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>, the brewers' monopoly and parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p>He was also a lawyer, building up a practice in West Africa. He became close to <a href="Kwame_Nkrumah" title="wikilink">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, the first post-colonial president of <a href="Ghana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghana</a> and was appointed Ghana's attorney-general, a post he held until 1961. When Nkrumah was ousted in 1966, Bing was arrested and ill-treated, before being sent home some months later. His memoir of Nkrumah's Ghana, <em>Reap the Whirlwind</em>, was published in 1968.</p>
