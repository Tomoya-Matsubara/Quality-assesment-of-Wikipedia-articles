<p>The <strong>Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise</strong> or <strong>Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos <a href="giant_tortoise" title="wikilink">giant tortoise</a></strong> (<em>Chelonoidis nigra</em>) is the largest living species of <a href="tortoise" class="uri" title="wikilink">tortoise</a> and <a href="Largest_organisms#Reptiles_(Reptilia)" title="wikilink">13th-heaviest living reptile</a>, reaching weights of over  and lengths of over . With life spans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived <a href="vertebrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">vertebrates</a>. A captive individual lived at least 170 years.</p>
<p>The tortoise is native to seven of the <a href="Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_Islands" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands</a>, a volcanic <a href="archipelago" class="uri" title="wikilink">archipelago</a> about  west of the <a href="Ecuador" title="wikilink">Ecuadorian</a> mainland. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish <em>gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pago</em>, meaning <a href="tortoise" class="uri" title="wikilink">tortoise</a>.</p>
<p>Shell size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks - on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with &quot;saddleback&quot; shells and long necks. <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin's</a> observations of these differences on the <a href="second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle" title="wikilink">second voyage of the <em>Beagle</em></a> in 1835, contributed to the <a href="Evolution" title="wikilink">development of his theory of evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by exploitation of the species for meat and oil, <a href="Habitat_destruction" title="wikilink">habitat clearance</a> for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. Ten <a href="Subspecies_of_Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_tortoise" title="wikilink">subspecies</a> of the original fifteen survive in the wild; an eleventh subspecies (<em><a href="Chelonoidis_nigra_abingdoni" title="wikilink">C. n. abingdonii</a></em>) had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed <a href="Lonesome_George" title="wikilink">Lonesome George</a> until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of <a href="Captive_breeding" title="wikilink">captive-bred</a> juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and it is estimated that the total number of the species exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).</p>

Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of <em>nigra: &quot;Testudo toto corpore nigro&quot;</em> means &quot;tortoise with completely black body&quot;. Quoy and Gairmard described <em>nigra</em> from a living specimen, but there is no evidence that they knew of its accurate provenance within the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos &lt;U+2013&gt; the locality was in fact given as California.

<p>Previously, the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus <em><a href="Geochelone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geochelone</a></em>, known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus <em><a href="Chelonoidis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chelonoidis</a></em> was elevated to generic status based on <a href="phylogenetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">phylogenetic</a> evidence which grouped the South American members of <em>Geochelone</em> into an independent <a href="clade" class="uri" title="wikilink">clade</a> (branch of the <a href="tree_of_life_(biology)" title="wikilink">tree of life</a>).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>All <a href="subspecies_of_Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_tortoise" title="wikilink">subspecies of Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise</a> evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater <a href="biological_dispersal" title="wikilink">dispersal</a>. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Survival on the 1000 km oceanic journey is accounted for by the fact that the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the <a href="Humboldt_Current" title="wikilink">Humboldt Current</a>, which diverts westwards towards the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands from the mainland.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The ancestors of the genus <em><a href="Chelonoidis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chelonoidis</a></em> are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the <a href="Oligocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oligocene</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise is the <a href="Argentine_tortoise" title="wikilink">Argentine tortoise</a> (<em>Chelonoidis chilensis</em>), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between <em>C. chilensis</em> and <em>C. nigra</em> probably occurred 6&lt;U+2013&gt;12 million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands 5 million years ago.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> <a href="Mitochondrial_DNA" title="wikilink">Mitochondrial DNA</a> analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola and San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a &quot;stepping stone&quot; fashion via local currents.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Restricted <a href="gene_flow" title="wikilink">gene flow</a> between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern subspecies.

<dt>Isabela Island</dt>

<p>The five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true subspecies or just distinct populations. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate subspecies.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf subspecies (<em>C. n. becki</em>) while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> It is thought that tortoises from Santa Cruz first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (<em>C. n. guentheri</em>) and therefore form the subspecies <em>C. n. vandenburghi</em> (Alcedo) and <em>C. n. microphyes</em> (Darwin).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (<em>C. n. vicina</em>) is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727<U+2013>1744&quot;/&gt; Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers they are all genetically different and should each be considered a separate subspecies.<ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727<U+2013>1744&quot;/&gt;</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The tortoises have a large bony <a href="carapace" class="uri" title="wikilink">carapace</a> (shell) of a dull brown colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton. <a href="Lichen" title="wikilink">Lichens</a> can grow on the shells of these slow-moving animals.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Tortoises keep a characteristic <a href="scute" class="uri" title="wikilink">scute</a> (shell segment) pattern on their shell throughout life, though the annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because the outer layers are worn off with time. A tortoise can withdraw its head, neck and forelimbs into its shell for protection. The legs are large and stumpy, with dry scaly skin and hard <a href="Scale_(zoology)" title="wikilink">scales</a>. The front legs have five claws, the back legs four.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gigantism">Gigantism</h3>
<p>The discoverer of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands, Fray Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, wrote in 1535 of &quot;such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Naturalist Charles Darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835, &quot;These animals grow to an immense size ... several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground&quot;.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over <a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and lengths of .<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The tortoises' gigantism was probably a preadapted condition for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved <a href="Island_gigantism" title="wikilink">insular gigantism</a>. Large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving the journey over water from the mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above the water level and have a smaller <a href="Surface-area-to-volume_ratio" title="wikilink">surface area/volume ratio</a>, which reduces <a href="Osmosis" title="wikilink">osmotic</a> water loss. Their significant water and fat reserves would allow the tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water, and to endure the drought-prone climate of the islands. A larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to <a href="gigantothermy" class="uri" title="wikilink">gigantothermy</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Fossil giant tortoises from mainland South America have been described that support this hypothesis of preadapted gigantism.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="shell-shape">Shell shape</h3>

<p>Galap&lt;U+00E1&gt;gos tortoises are the only lineage of giant tortoise exhibiting different types of shell shape.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from &quot;saddleback&quot; (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to &quot;domed&quot; (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When saddleback tortoises withdraw their head and forelimbs into their shells, a large unprotected gap remains over their neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure. There is no saddleback/domed dualism, as tortoises can be of intermediate type with characteristics of both. Larger islands with humid highlands over  in elevation, such as Santa Cruz, have abundant vegetation near the ground.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger, with shorter necks and limbs. Saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than  in elevation with dry habitats (e.g. Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola and Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n) that are more limited in food and other resources.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Evolutionary implications</dt>

</dl>
<p>In combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the <em><a href="Opuntia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Opuntia</a></em> (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Saddlebacks are more territorial<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and smaller than domed varieties, possibly adaptations to limited resources. Alternatively, larger tortoises may be better-suited to high elevations because they can resist the cooler temperatures that occur when there is cloud cover or fog.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>A competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a <a href="Secondary_sex_characteristics" title="wikilink">secondary sexual characteristic</a> of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by <a href="dominance_(ethology)" title="wikilink">dominance</a> displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> (<a href="#Reproduction" title="wikilink">see below</a>). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>The saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats,<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Saddleback tortoises are, therefore, not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts, as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background, but by a similar ecological one.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Sexual dimorphism</dt>

</dl>
<p><a href="Sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">Sexual dimorphism</a> is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Males of all varieties generally have a longer tail and a shorter, concave undershell with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating.

<h3 id="routine">Routine</h3>
<p>The tortoises are <a href="ectotherm" title="wikilink">ectothermic</a> (cold-blooded) and therefore bask for 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8&lt;U+2013&gt;9 hours a day.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of .<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>On the larger and more humid islands, the tortoises seasonally migrate between low elevations, which become grassy plains in the wet season, and meadowed areas of higher elevation (up to <a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a>) in the dry season. The same routes have been used for many generations, creating well-defined paths through the undergrowth known as &quot;tortoise highways&quot;.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> On these wetter islands, the domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds, in contrast to the more solitary and territorial disposition of the saddleback tortoises.</p>
<p>Tortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, which may be both a <a href="Thermoregulation" title="wikilink">thermoregulatory</a> response during cool nights, and a protection from <a href="Parasitism" title="wikilink">parasites</a> such as mosquitoes and ticks.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a>  - others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the earth or brush called a &quot;pallet&quot;. Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volc&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Alcedo, results in the formation of small sandy pits.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
<p><img src="Galapagos_giant_tortoise_feeding.jpg" title="fig:A tortoise feeding" alt="A tortoise feeding" /> The tortoises are <a href="herbivore" title="wikilink">herbivores</a> that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, and berries. They have been documented feeding on <em><a href="Manchineel_tree" title="wikilink">Hippomane mancinella</a></em> ('poison apple'), the endemic <a href="guava" class="uri" title="wikilink">guava</a> <em>Psidium galapageium</em>, the <a href="Mosquito_fern" title="wikilink">water fern</a> <em>Azolla microphylla</em>, and the <a href="Tillandsia" title="wikilink">bromeliad</a> <em>Tillandsia insularis</em>.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> A tortoise eats an average of  per day, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>Tortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the <em><a href="Opuntia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Opuntia</a></em> cactus); therefore, they can survive long periods without water. They can endure 18 months when deprived of all food and water,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a by-product. When thirsty they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the &quot;root of the neck&quot; (the <a href="pericardium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pericardium</a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a>), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="senses">Senses</h3>
<p>Regarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed that: &quot;The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead.&quot;<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Although they are not deaf,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mutualism">Mutualism</h3>
<p>Tortoises share a <a href="Mutualism_(biology)" title="wikilink">mutualistic</a> relationship with some species of <a href="Darwin&#39;s_finches" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos finch</a> and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, <a href="cloaca" title="wikilink">cloacal</a> opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating <a href="ectoparasite" title="wikilink">ectoparasites</a>.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="mating">Mating</h3>
<p><a href="Mating" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mating</a> occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> When mature males meet in the mating season they will face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise will back off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback subspecies, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>The prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> described as &quot;rhythmic groans&quot;.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="egg-laying">Egg-laying</h3>
<p>Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a  deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to sixteen spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from  in mass,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> and the size of a billiard ball.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Some observations suggest that the average <a href="clutch_(eggs)" title="wikilink">clutch</a> size for domed populations (9.6 per clutch for <em>porteri</em> on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6 per clutch for <em>duncanensis</em> on Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n).<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay 1&lt;U+2013&gt;4 clutches per season. <a href="Temperature-dependent_sex_determination" title="wikilink">Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings</a>, with lower temperature nests producing more males and higher temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early will incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs that are laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p>Young animals emerge from the nest after four to eight months and may weigh only  and measure .<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take several weeks, though their yolk sac can sustain them for up to seven months.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> In particularly dry conditions, the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil, while flooding of the nest area can drown them. Subspecies are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces. The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10&lt;U+2013&gt;15 years,<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> encountering hazards such as falling into cracks, being crushed by falling rocks, or excessive heat stress. The <a href="Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_Hawk" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Hawk</a> was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings; Darwin wrote: &quot;The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: &quot;The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices.

<p>Sex can be determined only when the tortoise is about 15 years old, and <a href="sexual_maturity" title="wikilink">sexual maturity</a> is reached at around 20&lt;U+2013&gt;25 years in captivity, possibly 40 years in the wild (when they reach their full size).

<p>Darwin wrote in his account of the voyage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr. Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought ... The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described* those from Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle, while the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted&quot;.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

<p>Even though the <em>Beagle</em> departed from the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these weren't for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing.

These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain <a href="Robert_FitzRoy" title="wikilink">FitzRoy</a> (two from Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola) and his servant <a href="Syms_Covington" title="wikilink">Syms Covington</a> (from Floreana).<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos was unknown.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> However, conversations with the naturalist <a href="Gabriel_Bibron" title="wikilink">Gabriel Bibron</a>, who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that there were distinct varieties.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Darwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of <a href="mockingbird" title="wikilink">mockingbirds</a>, in the first<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties ... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: &quot;animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances. &lt;U+2013&gt; Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox, &lt;U+2013&gt; Inglish and Irish Hare.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.</p>
<p>Darwin also found these &quot;antediluvian animals&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> to be a source of diversion: &quot;I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;&lt;U+2014&gt;but I found it very difficult to keep my balance&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="conservation">Conservation</h2>
<p>Several waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census.

<p>An estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a>), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th century British pirate, explorer and naturalist <a href="William_Dampier" title="wikilink">William Dampier</a> wrote that &quot;They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly,&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> while Captain <a href="James_Colnett" title="wikilink">James Colnett</a> of the British Navy wrote of &quot;the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> US Navy captain <a href="David_Porter_(naval_officer)" title="wikilink">David Porter</a> declared that, &quot;after once tasting the Gallipagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation ... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing &quot;the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do &quot;carne con cuero&quot;), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.&quot;<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 17th century, <a href="pirate" title="wikilink">pirates</a> started to use the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water and repairing vessels before attacking <a href="Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Spanish colonies</a> on the South American mainland. However, the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the 1790s and the 1860s, <a href="whaling" class="uri" title="wikilink">whaling</a> ships and <a href="Fur_seal#Exploitation" title="wikilink">fur-sealers</a> systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Some were used for food and many more were killed for high grade &quot;turtle oil&quot; from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of, the scarcity of tortoises that they had created, and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>Population decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture and the introduction of alien mammal species.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Feral pigs, dogs, cats and <a href="black_rat" title="wikilink">black rats</a> have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana subspecies in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>Scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990.

<p>The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise is now strictly protected and is listed on Appendix I of the <a href="CITES" title="wikilink">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a>.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> The listing requires that trade in the <a href="taxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxon</a> and its products are subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936 the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species.

<p>Breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered subspecies up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>The most significant population recovery was that of the Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola Tortoise (<em>hoodensis</em>), which was saved from near-certain extinction. The population had been depleted to 3 males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no <a href="mating_in_the_wild" title="wikilink">mating in the wild</a> had occurred.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the <a href="Charles_Darwin_Research_Station" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin Research Station</a> in 1971 for a captive breeding program<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> and, in the following 33 years, they gave rise to over 1,200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>

<p>The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos National Park Service systematically <a href="culling" title="wikilink">culls</a> feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using &quot;Judas&quot; goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the &quot;Judas&quot; and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. This process was repeated until only the &quot;Judas&quot; goat remained, which was then killed.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Other measures have included dog eradication from San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal, and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises in order to restore their ecosystems (<a href="island_restoration" title="wikilink">island restoration</a>) to their pre-human condition.

Birds such as <a href="Galapagos_Flycatcher" title="wikilink">Flycatchers</a> perch on and fly around tortoises in order to hunt the insects they displace from the brush.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years ago in 1972.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Sterile tortoises were released so that the problem of interbreeding between subspecies would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future.
