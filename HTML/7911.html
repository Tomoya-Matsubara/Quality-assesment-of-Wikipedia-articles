<p><strong>State Route 67</strong> (<strong>SR 67</strong>) is a <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> in <a href="San_Diego_County,_California" title="wikilink">San Diego County</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. It begins at <a href="Interstate_8_(California)" title="wikilink">Interstate 8</a> (I-8) in <a href="El_Cajon,_California" title="wikilink">El Cajon</a> and continues to <a href="Lakeside,_California" title="wikilink">Lakeside</a> as the <strong>San Vicente Freeway</strong> before becoming an <a href="undivided_highway" title="wikilink">undivided highway</a> through the eastern part of <a href="Poway,_California" title="wikilink">Poway</a>. In the town of <a href="Ramona,_California" title="wikilink">Ramona</a>, the route turns into Main Street before ending at <a href="State_Route_78_(California)" title="wikilink">SR 78</a>. SR 67 provides direct access from the city of <a href="San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> to the <a href="East_County,_San_Diego" title="wikilink">East County</a> region of San Diego County, including Ramona and <a href="Julian,_California" title="wikilink">Julian</a>.</p>
<p>The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as <strong>Legislative Route 198</strong> in the state highway system by 1935. Route 198 was renumbered SR 67 in the <a href="1964_state_highway_renumbering_(California)" title="wikilink">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The <a href="California_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer.</p>

<p>SR 67 begins at <a href="Interstate_8" title="wikilink">I-8</a> in <a href="El_Cajon,_California" title="wikilink">El Cajon</a>; known as the San Vicente Freeway, it turns north near the <a href="Westfield_Parkway" title="wikilink">Westfield Parkway</a> shopping center. There are two <a href="interchange_(road)" title="wikilink">interchanges</a> in the city of El Cajon: one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway, and another with Bradley Avenue. Following this, the freeway leaves the El Cajon city limits, entering the city of <a href="Santee,_California" title="wikilink">Santee</a> near <a href="Gillespie_Field" title="wikilink">Gillespie Field</a>, before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of <a href="California_State_Route_52" title="wikilink">SR 52</a> in Santee. Near the Woodside Avenue exit, SR 67 turns northeast, paralleling the <a href="San_Diego_River" title="wikilink">San Diego River</a> and entering the unincorporated area of <a href="Eucalyptus_Hills,_California" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus Hills</a> as it leaves the San Diego urban area. Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The freeway ends, and SR 67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the town of <a href="Moreno,_San_Diego_County,_California" title="wikilink">Moreno</a>. SR 67 then enters the rural area east of <a href="Sycamore_Canyon_County_Open_Space_Preserve" title="wikilink">Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve</a> near the town of <a href="Foster,_San_Diego_County,_California" title="wikilink">Foster</a>, passing to the west of <a href="San_Vicente_Reservoir" title="wikilink">San Vicente Reservoir</a>. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and <a href="County_Route_S4_(California)" title="wikilink">County Route S4</a> (CR S4), the latter within the <a href="Poway,_California" title="wikilink">Poway</a> city limits. In eastern Poway, SR 67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated <a href="Rock_Haven,_California" title="wikilink">Rock Haven</a>. The road continues near <a href="Rosemont,_California" title="wikilink">Rosemont</a> before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown <a href="Ramona,_California" title="wikilink">Ramona</a>. SR 67 ends at the intersection with <a href="California_State_Route_78" title="wikilink">SR 78</a>; SR 78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards <a href="Julian,_California" title="wikilink">Julian</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>SR 67 is part of the <a href="California_Freeway_and_Expressway_System" title="wikilink">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> but is not part of the <a href="National_Highway_System_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Highway System</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> a network of highways that are essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The route is named the CHP Officer Christopher D.

<p>The &quot;Julian road&quot; had been constructed by 1872, and was used for <a href="stagecoaches" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoaches</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 1883, <em>The San Diego Union and Daily Bee</em> described it as a &quot;disgrace to the county.

<p>The State Highway Commission decided to reroute SR 67 through Lakeside in 1954, moving it closer to the San Diego River and away from the city center, using the land formerly occupied by the old railroad.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1961, the construction of the San Vicente Freeway was listed as a high-priority project by the <a href="California_Chamber_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">California Chamber of Commerce</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> During 1964, the county of San Diego received $1 million (about $ ) to construct SR 67 as a freeway from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Another $1 million (about $ ) was allocated in 1965, and the project was extended to I-8.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The freeway from I-8 to Pepper Drive was complete by 1967, when Caltrans announced that &quot;yellow, non-reflectorized markers interspersed with raised yellow dots&quot; would be installed on the freeway portion to delineate the shoulder; this was the first section to use them in the county.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> By December 1968, the freeway was complete from I-8 north to Woodside Avenue; the grade at the northern end was smoothed out during the widening of the road in early 1970.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In March, the freeway was under construction from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River, at a cost of $3.2 million (about $ ).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The freeway portion opened on October 12, 1970;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> it was constructed four lanes wide.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>The highway portion of SR 67 was popularly known as &quot;Slaughterhouse Alley&quot; because of the high number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about $ ), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century. In 2000, a $1 million project (about $ ) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413 accidents and 15 fatalities on SR 67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents, with collisions resulting from cars &quot;jockeying&quot; to be ahead. Head-on collisions are another source of crashes.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite this, in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2009, the <a href="San_Diego_Association_of_Governments" title="wikilink">San Diego Association of Governments</a> (SANDAG) announced that fixing SR 67 was number 17 on its priority list, resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway that would not be limited-access.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A month later, Caltrans and the <a href="California_Highway_Patrol" title="wikilink">California Highway Patrol</a> agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December 2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR 67.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="further-developments">Further developments</h3>
<p>In 1983, the Kassler Corporation was awarded a contract to renovate the interchange with I-8 for $9.1 million (about $ ).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> SR 67 from Poway Road to the Poway city limits was proposed to be widened in 1985.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> There was a movement in 1987 to construct a northbound offramp at Woodside Avenue, due to traffic congestion at the Prospect Avenue offramp;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> however, it was never built.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <a href="Call_boxes" title="wikilink">Call boxes</a> were installed on SR 67 in 1994.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>There was also a proposal in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The next year, SANDAG approved the construction of a southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200 million as part of a 2030 transportation plan.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a <a href="roundabout" class="uri" title="wikilink">roundabout</a> instead of widening the highway.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>The road's guardrails and signs sustained damage in the 2003 <a href="Cedar_Fire" title="wikilink">Cedar Fire</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> That year, there were plans to widen Route 67 from Mapleview Street to Dye Road; however, when threatened with a lawsuit from Save Our Forests and Ranchlands, SANDAG agreed to &quot;reconsider&quot; the project.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Traffic jams were prevalent on October 21 and 22 in 2007, during the <a href="October_2007_California_wildfires" title="wikilink">ongoing local wildfires</a> and the evacuation of Ramona on the narrow road.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Heavy construction&quot; of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008, after it had been delayed by funding issues that were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The interchange with SR 52 began to be constructed in mid-June 2008.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> This new interchange opened to traffic on March 29, 2011.
