He then took up a post lecturing at <a href="Sydney_College_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Sydney College of the Arts</a>. He works in different media including <a href="printmaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">printmaking</a>, drawing, painting, and sculpture. The dominant theme in Mellor's art is the relationship between <a href="Indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">Indigenous</a> and non-Indigenous Australian cultures.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Mellor's works have been included regularly in National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibitions; in 2003 he was awarded a &quot;highly commended&quot;, for his print <em>Cyathea cooperi</em>, and in 2009 he won the principal prize, for a mixed media work <em>From Rite to Ritual</em>. His other major exhibitions have included the <em>Primavera 2005</em> show at the <a href="Museum_of_Contemporary_Art,_Sydney" title="wikilink">Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney</a>, and the National Indigenous Art Triennial at the <a href="National_Gallery_of_Australia" title="wikilink">National Gallery of Australia</a> in 2007. In 2012, his work was included in the <a href="National_Museum_of_Australia" title="wikilink">National Museum of Australia</a>'s exhibition <em>Menagerie: contemporary Indigenous sculpture</em> as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial.</p>

<p>After completing a Certificate in Art at the North Adelaide School of Art in 1991, Mellor undertook a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the ANU in 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;1994, and a Masters in Fine Art at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, part of the <a href="Birmingham_City_University" title="wikilink">Birmingham City University</a>, in 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1996.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the early 2000s, he entered a doctorate at the ANU, where he also taught print-media and drawing.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> As of 2012, Mellor is a lecturer at Sydney College of the Arts, within the <a href="University_of_Sydney" title="wikilink">University of Sydney</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the <a href="Grafton,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Grafton</a> Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while studying in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled <em>Passage</em>, at <a href="Kyoto_Seika_University" title="wikilink">Kyoto Seika University</a> in Japan in 1994, and <em>Fragile Objects</em> at the <a href="National_Library_of_Australia" title="wikilink">National Library of Australia</a> in 1996.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Mellor's works have been included in the <a href="National_Aboriginal_&amp;_Torres_Strait_Islander_Art_Award" title="wikilink">National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a> on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010.

<p><em>Primavera 2005</em>, an annual exhibition of young artists' work held at the <a href="Museum_of_Contemporary_Art,_Sydney" title="wikilink">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Sydney, included Mellor's work <em>Fig 1-100 (This particular collection made sense)</em>, a mixed media composition that included specimens of <a href="Ulysses_butterfly" title="wikilink">Ulysses butterflies</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He has had numerous other exhibitions, both individually and as part of group shows, at galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery in 2003, the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery in 2006, and the Indigenous Ceramic Art Awards, at Shepparton Gallery in Victoria in 2007.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Mellor's work was represented in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture <em>The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness)</em> featuring a <a href="diorama" class="uri" title="wikilink">diorama</a> that included sculpted <a href="kangaroo" title="wikilink">kangaroos</a> made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking <a href="Spode" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spode</a> <a href="bone_china" title="wikilink">bone china</a>), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and <a href="Ocular_prosthesis" title="wikilink">synthetic eyeballs</a>; <a href="Taxidermy" title="wikilink">stuffed birds</a> sat in a life-sized mixed-media tree overhead.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by <em><a href="The_Adelaide_Advertiser" title="wikilink">The Adelaide Advertiser</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Canberra_Times" title="wikilink">The Canberra Times</a></em>, <em><a href="The_West_Australian" title="wikilink">The West Australian</a></em> and the <a href="Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Mellor_From_Rite_to_Ritual.jpg" title="fig:Mellor&#39;s From Rite to Ritual (2009)" alt="Mellor&#39;s From Rite to Ritual (2009)" /> Mellor's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter <a href="Rover_Thomas" title="wikilink">Rover Thomas</a>, Australian <a href="Sir_John_Sulman_Prize" title="wikilink">Sulman Prize</a> winner <a href="Tim_Storrier" title="wikilink">Tim Storrier</a>, <a href="German_Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> painters including Germany's <a href="Caspar_David_Friedrich" title="wikilink">Caspar David Friedrich</a>, and contemporary German artists <a href="Joseph_Beuys" title="wikilink">Joseph Beuys</a>, and Beuys' student <a href="Anselm_Kiefer" title="wikilink">Anselm Kiefer</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, <em><a href="Artlink_Magazine" title="wikilink">Artlink Magazine</a></em>'s reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified &quot;how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work <em>Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties</em>, which, like <em>From Rite to Ritual</em>, drew on evocations of Spode china, she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross-cultural relations. Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting, she observed: </p>
<p><em>From Rite to Ritual</em> examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described the work as showing &quot;what is a moment of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the &quot;surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references&quot; made the work &quot;outstanding&quot; and of &quot;great complexity and grace&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Art writer Nicholas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel &quot;between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> </p>
<p>Themes around the relationships between cultures were examined in Mellor's earlier works, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed &quot;images of native and introduced flora and fauna&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, a kangaroo with a bull&lt;U+2014&gt;to symbolise two different peoples and cultures&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition <em>Native Titled Now</em>, shown in South Australia in 1996.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, &quot;so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>For Mellor, Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and (not necessarily by his own choice) in public life. As a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features, his appearance has occasionally raised questions of &quot;authenticity&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Mellor found himself the target of columnist <a href="Andrew_Bolt" title="wikilink">Andrew Bolt</a>, who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Bolt wrote &quot;This white university lecturer, with his nice Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside real draw-in-the-dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who'd also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Commentator Ellie Savage, criticising Bolt, wondered why someone who &quot;neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it&quot; should therefore have &quot;no right to enter competitions for indigenous artists&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians -not including Mellor- for racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair-skinned Indigenous people, including the post that had lambasted Mellor.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Art writer Maurice O'Riordan, reviewing the 2009 Award, noted the Bolt controversy, but pointed out that Mellor, while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage, is not concerned with the definition of Aboriginality, but with historical interaction between cultures and the re-imagining of history.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
