<p>The <strong>Combine</strong>, abbreviated as <strong>CMB</strong> and referred to as &quot;<strong>Our Benefactors</strong>&quot;, is a <a href="multiverse" title="wikilink">multidimensional</a> empire which serves as the primary <a href="antagonist" title="wikilink">antagonistic</a> force in the <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> <em><a href="Half-Life_2" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2</a></em>, developed by <a href="Valve_Corporation" title="wikilink">Valve Corporation</a>. The Combine consist of alien, synthetic, and human elements, and dominate Earth. They are regularly encountered throughout <em><a href="Half-Life_2" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2</a></em> and its <a href="Episodic_game" title="wikilink">episodic</a> expansions as hostile <a href="non-player_character" title="wikilink">non-player characters</a> as the player progresses through the games in an effort to overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth.</p>
<p>The Combine are frequently shown as harsh rulers over the citizens of Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, <a href="Police_brutality" title="wikilink">policing using violence</a> and using <a href="invasive_surgery" title="wikilink">invasive surgery</a> to <a href="Transhuman" title="wikilink">transform humans</a> into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the <a href="dystopia" title="wikilink">dystopian</a> Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the <a href="game_artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a> of the <a href="transhuman" class="uri" title="wikilink">transhuman</a> Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in <em>Half-Life 2</em>. In addition to their role within the <em>Half-Life</em> series, the Combine have been adapted for <a href="machinima" class="uri" title="wikilink">machinima</a> productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.</p>

<p>During <em>Half-Life 2</em>{{'}}s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were created and later cut. Female Combine assassins, similar to <a href="black_operations" title="wikilink">black operations</a> assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the <em><a href="Half-Life_2:_Survivor" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2: Survivor</a></em> arcade game.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Another non-player character, the cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with an acid gun and although removed from the game, its head was featured in <a href="Eli_Vance" title="wikilink">Eli Vance's</a> laboratory. Other cuts included a variety of alien Combine soldiers that would have complemented the transhuman soldiers in the game and a number of synthetic combat machines.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Many of <em>Half-Life 2</em>{{'}}s Combine characters went through multiple redesigns; the Combine Overwatch soldier was subjected to at least twelve redesigns before the final appearance was settled on.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="society">Society</h3>
<p>Little is revealed of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in <em><a href="Half-Life_2" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2</a></em> states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by a range of species.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is shown to be a brutal <a href="police_state" title="wikilink">police state</a>. In <a href="City_17" title="wikilink">City 17</a>, a generic <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern European</a> city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random <a href="police_brutality" title="wikilink">police brutality</a>. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Vortigaunt" title="wikilink">Vortigaunts</a>, alien creatures from the original <em><a href="Half-Life_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Half-Life</a></em>, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to <em><a href="Half-Life_2:_Raising_the_Bar" title="wikilink">Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar</a></em>, the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>At the heart of the Combine's command structure in <em>Half-Life 2</em> is the Citadel, an enormous, monolithic structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, <a href="Wallace_Breen" title="wikilink">Wallace Breen</a>. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a>. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.</p>
<h3 id="depiction">Depiction</h3>
<p>The Combine is composed of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout <em>Half-Life 2</em> and its expansions are the Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines and &quot;synths&quot; are also encountered.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="advisors">Advisors</h4>
<p><img src="Advisor_(Half-Life).jpg" title="fig:The Advisor&#39;s grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author Frank Herbert" alt="The Advisor&#39;s grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author Frank Herbert" /> Advisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible <a href="proboscis" class="uri" title="wikilink">proboscis</a>. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess <a href="telekinesis" title="wikilink">telekinetic powers</a> with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Their appearance was based on the <a href="Guild_Navigator" title="wikilink">Guild Navigators</a> from the film <em><a href="Dune_(film)" title="wikilink">Dune</a></em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="civil-protection">Civil Protection</h4>
<p>Civil Protection is the Combine's <a href="Police" title="wikilink">law enforcement</a> agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks. They are usually armed with <a href="Electroshock_weapon" title="wikilink">electroshock batons</a> and <a href="pistol" title="wikilink">pistols</a>, and are occasionally seen using <a href="submachine_gun" title="wikilink">submachine guns</a>. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme <a href="police_brutality" title="wikilink">police brutality</a> are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as &quot;protectors of the civilians{{'}} well-being&quot;. On the outskirts of <a href="City_17" title="wikilink">City 17</a>, Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="overwatch">Overwatch</h4>
<p>The Combine Overwatch is the primary military force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of <a href="Transhuman" title="wikilink">biomechanically enhanced humans</a>, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor, while the majority of soldiers wear variations of blue or brown armor. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including <a href="shotgun" title="wikilink">shotguns</a>, submachine guns, <a href="sniper_rifle" title="wikilink">sniper rifles</a> and <a href="pulse_rifle" title="wikilink">pulse rifles</a>. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and <a href="grenade" title="wikilink">grenades</a> to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of <a href="Dropship_(science_fiction)" title="wikilink">dropships</a>. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after a large uprising near the end of <em>Half-Life 2</em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="combine-technology">Combine technology</h4>
<p>The Combine use a large array of <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> technology. They have access to <a href="teleportation" class="uri" title="wikilink">teleportation</a> technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by <a href="Eli_Vance" title="wikilink">Eli Vance</a>, <a href="Isaac_Kleiner" title="wikilink">Isaac Kleiner</a> and <a href="Judith_Mossman" title="wikilink">Judith Mossman</a> in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, known as &quot;city scanners&quot;, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause <a href="laceration" class="uri" title="wikilink">laceration</a> injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of <a href="land_mine" title="wikilink">land mines</a>; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical &quot;rollermines&quot; roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Militarily, the Combine make use of both synthetic machines&lt;U+2014&gt;machines powered by organic components&lt;U+2014&gt;and traditional mechanical machines such as <a href="armored_personnel_carrier" title="wikilink">armored personnel carriers</a> and <a href="attack_helicopter" title="wikilink">attack helicopters</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like <a href="gunship" title="wikilink">gunships</a>; and Striders,  armored creatures possessing three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In <em>Episode Two</em>, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, the Hunter, is introduced. These 2.5 m (8 ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the <em>Half-Life 2</em>, although their roles are not elaborated on. <a href="Sentry_gun" title="wikilink">Sentry turrets</a> are also used by the Combine.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Combine also use <a href="headcrab" title="wikilink">headcrabs</a> as a <a href="biological_weapon" title="wikilink">biological weapon</a> against dissidents, firing specialized artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Combine_soldiers.png" title="fig:Two Overwatch soldiers in Episode Two, with a Hunter in the background" alt="Two Overwatch soldiers in Episode Two, with a Hunter in the background" /> According to the backstory presented during <em>Half-Life 2</em>, the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the <a href="Nihilanth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nihilanth</a>, the <a href="Boss_(video_games)" title="wikilink">boss character</a> at the end of <em><a href="Half-Life_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Half-Life</a></em>. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between <a href="Xen_(Half-Life)" title="wikilink">Xen</a> and the <a href="Black_Mesa_Research_Facility" title="wikilink">Black Mesa Research Facility</a> on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in &quot;portal storms&quot; which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When it is sufficiently wide, the Combine invade in force, and in the subsequent Seven Hour War quickly defeat the forces of Earth and destroy the <a href="United_Nations_Secretariat_Building" title="wikilink">United Nations Secretariat Building</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. Earth's surrender is negotiated by <a href="Wallace_Breen" title="wikilink">Wallace Breen</a>, who is then made the Combine administrator of Earth, and uses <a href="City_17" title="wikilink">City 17</a> as his base of operations.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The Combine's first appearance is in <em>Half-Life 2</em>. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in <em>Half-Life</em>, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of <a href="Black_Mesa_East" title="wikilink">Black Mesa East</a> and capture resistance leader <a href="Eli_Vance" title="wikilink">Eli Vance</a>, who is transferred to holding facilities at <a href="Nova_Prospekt" title="wikilink">Nova Prospekt</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Freeman and Vance's daughter <a href="Alyx_Vance" title="wikilink">Alyx</a> break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent <a href="Judith_Mossman" title="wikilink">Judith Mossman</a>. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="Half-Life_2:_Episode_One" title="wikilink">Episode One</a></em>, the destruction of the top of the Citadel has caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down, forcing Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the Citadel to temporarily stabilize it while the city's inhabitants are evacuated.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Combine, however, attempt to accelerate the meltdown to send a message to their native universe for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the data to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel sends the message and detonates, destroying City 17.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Half-Life_2:_Episode_Two" title="wikilink">Episode Two</a></em> opens with Alyx and Freeman discovering that the Citadel's destruction has resulted in the formation of a <a href="Portal_(fiction)" title="wikilink">super portal</a> to the Combine dimension, which is slowly progressing to a stage where it can send overwhelming reinforcements.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> They also discover that the data packet they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes that can be used to close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at <a href="White_Forest" title="wikilink">White Forest</a>. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by <a href="Vortigaunt" title="wikilink">Vortigaunts</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The super portal is destroyed after the resistance launch a satellite containing the appropriate data. However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.</p>
<h3 id="appearances-in-other-media">Appearances in other media</h3>
<p>The use of sandbox applications like <em><a href="Garry&#39;s_Mod" title="wikilink">Garry's Mod</a></em> have allowed for Combine <a href="non-player_character" title="wikilink">non-player characters</a> to be used in a variety of <a href="webcomic" title="wikilink">webcomics</a> and <a href="machinima" class="uri" title="wikilink">machinima</a> productions. In one webcomic, <em><a href="Concerned" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concerned</a></em>, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Peeman , in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In another example, the machinima series <em>Combine Nation</em> follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to <a href="police_procedural" title="wikilink">police procedural</a> documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with <a href="adhesive_bandage" title="wikilink">adhesive bandages</a> and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing <a href="flashbang" title="wikilink">flashbangs</a>, which often backfire on him.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Another web series, called <em>The Combine</em>, parodies the TV show <em><a href="The_Office" title="wikilink">The Office</a></em>. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a <a href="webfilter" class="uri" title="wikilink">webfilter</a> so they can watch videos online instead of working.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the <a href="live-action" class="uri" title="wikilink">live-action</a> video <em>The Combine Interview</em>, which parodies an interview with <a href="Tom_Cruise" title="wikilink">Tom Cruise</a> discussing <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a>. The video, described by ActionTrip as &quot;eerie, to say the least&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and by both <a href="Joystiq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joystiq</a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and <a href="Kotaku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kotaku</a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> as &quot;creepy&quot;, instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. <a href="PC_Gamer" title="wikilink"><em>PC Gamer</em> UK</a> noted that &quot;the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenising intergalactic murderous alien collective&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>The Combine have inspired the creation of several items of merchandise for the <em>Half-Life</em> series. A <a href="plush" class="uri" title="wikilink">plush</a> toy was created by Valve, based on the synthetic tripod Hunters introduced in <em>Episode Two</em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Sold and distributed via Valve's online store, the toy was released in February 2008.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In addition, Valve has produced <a href="t-shirt" title="wikilink">t-shirts</a> depicting the Combine's idea of humanity's <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a>, from ape to Combine Overwatch soldier,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and a <a href="lithograph" class="uri" title="wikilink">lithograph</a> displaying twelve pieces of <a href="concept_art" title="wikilink">concept art</a> for the Combine soldier.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reception">Reception</h3>
<p>The Combine have received a positive reaction from critics. <a href="1UP.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">1UP.com</a> praised the &quot;epic feel&quot; built up by the Combine and their harsh rule of City 17 in <em>Half-Life 2</em>, stating that this created &quot;a world governed by <a href="newspeak" class="uri" title="wikilink">newspeak</a>, decorated with urban decay, and lacking any hope&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> echoed this praise, saying that the &quot;vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective&quot;. <em><a href="PC_Zone" title="wikilink">PC Zone</a></em> described the appearance of the Combine's soldiers as &quot;<a href="Imperial_stormtrooper" title="wikilink">stormtrooper</a>-like&quot;, but although stating that overall the <a href="game_artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a> for the game was &quot;extremely competent&quot;, the Combine non-player characters &quot;could have used better survival instincts&quot;, citing their reluctance to take cover and tendency to charge at the player and into a shotgun blast.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> A number of reviews of <em>Episode One</em> were disappointed by the lack of new characters for the Combine,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> although GameSpot praised the improved AI for Combine soldiers and the addition of new abilities, such as rappelling down buildings. <a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The addition of the Hunter in <em>Episode Two</em> was particularly well received by critics; <em><a href="Computer_and_Video_Games" title="wikilink">Computer and Video Games</a></em> stated that they were challenging to fight and were &quot;a very welcome addition&quot; to the series,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> while <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> stated that the Hunters were &quot;impressively designed...
