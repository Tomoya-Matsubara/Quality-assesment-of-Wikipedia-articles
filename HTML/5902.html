In 1953 <a href="Shoghi_Effendi" title="wikilink">Shoghi Effendi</a>, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, planned an international teaching plan termed the <a href="Ten_Year_Crusade" title="wikilink">Ten Year Crusade</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Botswana from places.

In 2005 Lally Warren recalled that as a young child in Mafikeng it had been unusual to meet white people who were pleasant to her so she believed that all white people were bad.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> That changed when she met the Robarts family. &quot;The Robarts didn't treat me like a black child, they treated me as a child,&quot; she said. She recalled when she was 10 and the Robarts family came to her house for meetings with her parents, James and Stella Moncho, the first local couple to become Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, &quot;They could only do this at night, and as they came towards the house they would switch their [car] lights on and off to say, 'Is it ok, is it safe, can we come?'&lt;U+2026&gt;There was no electricity in the black area during those days so my mother would take a lantern and stick it out through the window and wave it to say, 'OK, it's safe for you to come.'&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Robarts family befriended Modiri Molema, a highly respected medical doctor and the only black man who was permitted to associate with whites.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Dr. Molema invited his friends and family to hear about the religion, and he gave the Robarts family letters of introduction to the <a href="Kgosi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kgosi</a> (traditional chiefs) of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Dr. Molema converted to the religion but his enrollment was not made public because of likely harassment due to his previous high-profile political involvement. In 1955 his relative, Stanlake Kukama, became the first native Tswana of Bechuanaland to become a publicly declared Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;. In 2005 Kukama recalled he had been an anti-apartheid activist, and was a member of the South African political party, the <a href="African_National_Congress" title="wikilink">African National Congress</a> and had detested white people because of their attitude towards Africans but that changed when he heard about the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith from the Robarts family: &quot;In 1955 I heard of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith and [found] the principles of the Faith were the solution to [achieve] peace and harmony for mankind.&lt;U+2026&gt; I realized that the white and the black were all blind. They did not see the truth, they did not have the eye of the soul. Hence, I became a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;, and renounced man-made solutions to peace.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The African National Congress tried to woo back Mr. Kukama for many years without success. The police kept him under surveillance even after he became a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; because they did not believe that he had given up partisan politics. Mr. Kukama later served for many years both as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s of Bophuthatswana and of South Africa.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 1956 the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1956 John Robarts was elected to it.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>By early 1957 the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community numbered between 10 and 20 individuals and became part of the regional national assembly of South and West Africa. By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The assemblies were in <a href="Lobatse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lobatse</a>, and <a href="Mahalapye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahalapye</a> and groups in <a href="Gaborone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaborone</a>, <a href="Ghanzi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghanzi</a>, <a href="Kopong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kopong</a>, <a href="Mafeking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mafeking</a>, <a href="Molepolole" class="uri" title="wikilink">Molepolole</a>, <a href="Morwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morwa</a>,<a href="Serowe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serowe</a>, and a lone Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; in <a href="Moeng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moeng</a> (which is near the <a href="Tswapong_Hills" title="wikilink">Tswapong Hills</a>).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="national-development">National development</h2>
<p>Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected <a href="Universal_House_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Universal House of Justice</a> was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; communities of Africa, including Botswana, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1967 the newly-elected regional assembly of South Central Africa, then comprised the countries of Botswana, Malawi and Rhodesia.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Its members were: Willard Mahtunge, Florence Fat'he-Aazam, Esther Moncho, Esther Glauder, Brian Eames, Enayat Sohaili, Leonard Chiposi, Helen A. Hope, and John D. Sargent Sr. There were ten delegates, sixty additional visitors for the fourth annual convention, held in Salisbury, Rhodesia.</p>
<p>In 1970 the first National Youth School in Botswana was attended by over thirty youth, adults and teachers.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Following the classes the youth visited three villages previously arranged by the national assembly with the approval of the local chiefs where they presented a well received speech especially prepared for them. Because of the reception of the speech they were invited to a further six villages by the chiefs of those villages ultimately presenting the religion to almost 700 attendees of the presentations. Coverage of the tour was also done on local radio. Later the first Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s from the <a href="Bushmen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bushmen</a> and the <a href="Kgalagadi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kgalagadi</a> had joined the religion.</p>
<p>The time came for the election of Botswana's Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; <a href="National_Spiritual_Assembly" title="wikilink">National Spiritual Assembly</a> elected in 1970.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Its members in the 1971 re-election were:<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Stanley Matenge, Esther Moncho, Isaac Kgang, Dennis Makiwa, Maureen Gruber, Robert Sarracino, Bogatlu Pheto, Jeffrey Gruber, and Broer Oageng.</p>

<p>In August 1971 the first public talks on the religion in <a href="Gaborone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaborone</a> were undertaken and was broadcast over <a href="List_of_radio_stations_in_Africa#.C2.A0Botswana" title="wikilink">Radio Botswana</a> on the topic of &quot;African Traditional Beliefs and the Unity of the World Religions&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A review of the community then noted that the national assembly and five local assemblies had incorporated and registered with the government. The national assembly then became legal owners of the national Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; center. Sixty-seven localities had been introduced to the religion and translations of some Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; scripture had been accomplished. Some forty chiefs at various levels had been sent messages by the national assembly about the religion. Fifty-seven villages had been visited with mass meetings resulting. There were only four pioneers present then. The village of Boneapitse was noted as being a majority of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.</p>
<p>An all-Bushman local assembly was first elected in <a href="Tshasane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tshasane</a> in 1972.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> When it was re-elected in 1973 its members were: Ci-!Gau, !'ea, Titi, Diolo, Kaka, Mashipa, N!!g''ae-!Nobo, Baberi, Mpalo.</p>

She congratulated the pioneers that were well out in the countryside rather than clustered in the capital. At another village she spoke at a teacher's training college noting the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; teaching of <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_Faith_and_gender_equality" title="wikilink">equality of the sexes</a> and the importance of mothers and teachers, <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_Faith_and_education" title="wikilink">eliminating illiteracy</a> but that matters of faith are not dependent on book learning.

Then she met with the national assembly especially about the topic of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; view of &quot;consultation&quot;, that the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; funds are to be spent on specific purposes for the promulgation of the religion.
