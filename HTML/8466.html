<p><strong>Henry III</strong> (1 October 1207Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 16 November 1272), also known as <strong>Henry of Winchester</strong>, was <a href="King_of_England" title="wikilink">King of England</a>, <a href="Lordship_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord of Ireland</a> and <a href="Duke_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Duke of Aquitaine</a> from 1216 until his death.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The son of <a href="John,_King_of_England" title="wikilink">King John</a> and <a href="Isabella_of_Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me" title="wikilink">Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me</a>, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">First Barons' War</a>. Cardinal <a href="Guala_Bicchieri" title="wikilink">Guala</a> declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by <a href="William_Marshal,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">William Marshal</a>, defeated the rebels at the battles of <a href="Battle_of_Lincoln_(1217)" title="wikilink">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Sandwich_(1217)" title="wikilink">Sandwich</a> in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the <a href="Magna_Carta#The_Great_Charter_1225" title="wikilink">Great Charter of 1225</a>, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by <a href="Hubert_de_Burgh,_1st_Earl_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Hubert de Burgh</a> and then <a href="Peter_des_Roches" title="wikilink">Peter des Roches</a>, who reestablished royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the <a href="John,_King_of_England#Loss_of_Normandy,_1202&lt;U+2013&gt;04" title="wikilink">provinces of France</a> that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, <a href="Richard_Marshal,_3rd_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">Richard</a>, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by <a href="Christianity_in_England" title="wikilink">the Church</a>.</p>
<p>Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite <a href="Castles_in_Great_Britain_and_Ireland#Palace-fortresses" title="wikilink">palaces and castles</a>. He married <a href="Eleanor_of_Provence" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Provence</a>, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his <a href="piety" class="uri" title="wikilink">piety</a>, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>, whom he adopted as his <a href="patron_saint" title="wikilink">patron saint</a>. He extracted huge sums of money from the <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_England" title="wikilink">Jews in England</a>, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the <a href="Statute_of_Jewry" title="wikilink">Statute of Jewry</a>, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded <a href="Poitou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitou</a> in 1242, leading to the disastrous <a href="Battle_of_Taillebourg" title="wikilink">Battle of Taillebourg</a>. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with <a href="Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II</a>. Henry supported his brother <a href="Richard,_1st_Earl_of_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Richard</a> in his bid to become <a href="King_of_the_Romans" title="wikilink">King of the Romans</a> in 1256, but was unable to place his own son <a href="Edmund_Crouchback" title="wikilink">Edmund</a> on the throne of <a href="Kingdom_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on <a href="crusade" class="uri" title="wikilink">crusade</a> to the <a href="Levant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Levant</a>, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in <a href="Gascony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gascony</a>.</p>
<p>By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his <a href="Poitiers" title="wikilink">Poitevin</a> half-brothers, the <a href="Lusignan_dynasty" title="wikilink">Lusignans</a>, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the <a href="Provisions_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Provisions of Oxford</a>. Henry and the baronial government enacted a <a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1259)" title="wikilink">peace with France</a> in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for <a href="Louis_IX_of_France" title="wikilink">King Louis IX of France</a> recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.</p>
<p>In 1263 one of the more radical barons, <a href="Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester" title="wikilink">Simon de Montfort</a>, seized power, resulting in the <a href="Second_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Second Barons' War</a>. Henry successfully persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The <a href="Battle_of_Lewes" title="wikilink">Battle of Lewes</a> occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward</a>, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the <a href="Battle_of_Evesham" title="wikilink">Battle of Evesham</a> the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the <a href="Dictum_of_Kenilworth" title="wikilink">Dictum of Kenilworth</a>. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some <a href="miracle" title="wikilink">miracles</a> were declared after his death but he was not <a href="Canonization" title="wikilink">canonised</a>. Henry's 56-year reign makes him the <a href="List_of_monarchs_in_Britain_by_length_of_reign" title="wikilink">fifth longest reigning monarch</a> in English history.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Little is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around  tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a drooping eyelid.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Henry grew up to occasionally show flashes of a fierce temper, but mostly, as historian <a href="David_Carpenter_(historian)" title="wikilink">David Carpenter</a> describes, he had an &quot;amiable, easy-going, and sympathetic&quot; personality.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He was unaffected and honest, and showed his emotions readily, easily being moved to tears by religious sermons.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of the 13th century, the <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">Kingdom of England</a> formed part of <a href="Angevin_empire" title="wikilink">an empire</a> spreading across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a>, who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> to the territories of <a href="Duchy_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>, <a href="Duchy_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Brittany</a>, <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> and <a href="County_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Anjou</a> in north-west France, onto <a href="Poitou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitou</a> and <a href="Gascony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gascony</a> in the south-west.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard</a> and John, to dominate France.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to <a href="Philip_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Philip II of France</a>, leaving English power on the continent limited to Gascony and Poitou.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> John raised taxes to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a <a href="Papacy" title="wikilink">Papal</a> <a href="fiefdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiefdom</a>, owing allegiance to the Pope.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the <em><a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a></em>. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the <em>Magna Carta</em> and the <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">First Barons' War</a> erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VIII</a>, who claimed the English throne for himself.<ref name="Carpenter 2004 264<U+2013>267&quot;/&gt; The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory.

<p>Henry believed that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> He thought that his predecessors had allowed the status of the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a> as his <a href="patron_saint" title="wikilink">patron saint</a>, hoping to emulate the way in which the <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p>Henry shared many of his religious views with Louis of France, and the two men appear to have been slightly competitive in their piety.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Towards the end of his reign, Henry may have taken up the practice of curing sufferers of <a href="Tuberculous_cervical_lymphadenitis" title="wikilink">scrofula</a>, often called &quot;the King's evil&quot;, by <a href="royal_touch" title="wikilink">touching them</a>, possibly emulating Louis, who also took up the practice.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Louis had a famous collection of <a href="Relics_associated_with_Jesus" title="wikilink">Passion Relics</a> which he stored at <a href="Sainte-Chapelle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sainte-Chapelle</a>, and paraded the <a href="True_Cross" title="wikilink">Holy Cross</a> through Paris in 1241; Henry took possession of the <a href="relic_of_the_Holy_Blood" title="wikilink">relic of the Holy Blood</a> in 1247, marching it through Westminster to be installed in Westminster Abbey, which he promoted as an alternative to the Sainte-Chapelle.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="jewish-policies">Jewish policies</h3>

<p>The <a href="Jews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jews</a> of England were considered the property of the Crown, and they had traditionally been used as a source of <a href="Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages#Jewish_contribution_to_the_English_economy" title="wikilink">cheap loans and easy taxation</a>, in exchange for royal protection against <a href="antisemitism#Persecutions_in_the_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">antisemitism</a>.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons' War, but during Henry's early years the community had flourished and became one of the most prosperous in Europe.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> This was primarily the result of the stance taken by the regency government, which took a range of measures to protect the Jews and encourage lending.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> This was driven by financial self-interest, as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Their policy ran counter to the instructions being sent from the Pope, however, who had laid out strong anti-Jewish measures at the <a href="Fourth_Lateran_Council" title="wikilink">Fourth Lateran Council</a> in 1215; William Marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from the Church.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1239 Henry introduced different policies, possibly trying to imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned and forced to pay fines equivalent to a third of their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Further huge demands for cash followed &lt;U+2013&gt; &lt;U+00A3&gt;40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years &lt;U+2013&gt; destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Henry had built the <em><a href="Domus_Conversorum" title="wikilink">Domus Conversorum</a></em> in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Anti-Jewish stories involving <a href="Blood_libel" title="wikilink">tales of child sacrifice</a> flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the <a href="Statute_of_Jewry" title="wikilink">Statute of Jewry</a> in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of <a href="Yellow_badge" title="wikilink">Jewish badges</a>; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>

<p>At his request, Henry was buried in Westminster Abbey in front of the church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current location in Westminster Abbey.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> His <a href="gilding" title="wikilink">gilt</a>-<a href="brass" class="uri" title="wikilink">brass</a> funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by <a href="William_Torell" title="wikilink">William Torell</a>; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly <a href="Realism_(arts)" title="wikilink">naturalistic</a> in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a></p>
<p>Eleanor probably hoped that Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled the shrine of a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, which at the time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a> Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories.

<h3 id="historiography">Historiography</h3>
<p><img src="Magna_Carta_(1225_version).jpg" title="fig:The Great Charter of 1225" alt="The Great Charter of 1225" /> The first histories of Henry's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of <a href="Roger_of_Wendover" title="wikilink">Roger of Wendover</a> and <a href="Matthew_Paris" title="wikilink">Matthew Paris</a>.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a> These early historians, including Archbishop <a href="Matthew_Parker" title="wikilink">Matthew Parker</a>, were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state, and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> During the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 19th century, Victorian scholars such as <a href="William_Stubbs" title="wikilink">William Stubbs</a>, James Ramsay, and <a href="William_Hunt_(priest)" title="wikilink">William Hunt</a> sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a> They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a> This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as <a href="Kate_Norgate" title="wikilink">Kate Norgate</a>'s 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a></p>
<p>After 1900, the financial and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the <a href="pipe_rolls" title="wikilink">pipe rolls</a>, court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Frederick_Tout" title="wikilink">Thomas Tout</a> made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> This wave of research culminated in Sir <a href="F._M._Powicke" title="wikilink">Maurice Powicke</a>'s two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King for the next three decades.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a></p>
<p>Henry's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> At the end of the 20th century, however, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian David Carpenter judges Henry to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler due to his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been &quot;essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful&quot;.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="popular-culture">Popular culture</h3>
<p>Henry's life was depicted in a series of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the <em>Chronica majora</em>.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering.<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary <a href="Dante_Alighieri" title="wikilink">Dante</a>, who depicted Henry in the <em><a href="Divine_Comedy" title="wikilink">Divine Comedy</a></em> as an example of a negligent ruler, sitting alone in <a href="Purgatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purgatory</a> to one side of the other failed kings.<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a> Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>, and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a></p>
