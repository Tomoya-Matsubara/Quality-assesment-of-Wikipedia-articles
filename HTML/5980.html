<p>Fisher was admitted to the <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a> Bar in 1938, and had the distinction of clerking for two <a href="U.S._Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">U.S. Supreme Court</a> Justices, <a href="Louis_Brandeis" title="wikilink">Louis Brandeis</a> (1938-39) and <a href="Felix_Frankfurter" title="wikilink">Felix Frankfurter</a> (1939-40). <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Fisher began his legal career with his appointment as <a href="Law_Clerk" title="wikilink">Law Clerk</a> to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was then 82 years old. In early 1939, Brandeis announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, and Fisher was invited to transfer to the chambers of the newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Following his term as Frankfurter's clerk in 1940, Fisher joined the <a href="United_States_Department_of_State" title="wikilink">United States Department of State</a> as the assistant chief of the <a href="Foreign_Funds_Control_Division" title="wikilink">Foreign Funds Control Division</a> of the State Department, where he served until shortly after the <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In early 1942, Fisher and <a href="John_J._McCloy" title="wikilink">John J.

<h3 id="korematsu-supreme-court-case">Korematsu Supreme Court Case</h3>
<p>In 1944, Fisher again was required to become involved in the U.S. 1942-43 <a href="internment" class="uri" title="wikilink">internment</a> of <a href="Japanese_Americans" title="wikilink">Japanese Americans</a> on the West Coast of the United States upon his return from <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. At that time, the case of <em><a href="Korematsu_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Korematsu v. United States</a></em>, challenging the U.S. government&lt;U+2019&gt;s power to exclude citizens of <a href="Japanese_people" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> ancestry from military zones, came before the <a href="United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a>. While the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Department of Justice</a>'s <a href="Herbert_Wechsler" title="wikilink">Herbert Wechsler</a> (Assistant U.S. Attorney) was in charge of defending the government's position before the Supreme Court, significant consultation with Fisher was required, as he was again with the legal affairs section of the <a href="War_Department" title="wikilink">War Department</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> During this period, Fisher was involved in critical drafting of the government's brief submitted to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2 id="return-to-washington-d.c.-and-service-with-dean-acheson">Return to Washington, D.C. and service with Dean Acheson</h2>
<p>Upon his return from Europe and exit from the Army Air Force, Fisher served as <a href="Solicitor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solicitor</a> for the U.S. <a href="Department_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">Department of Commerce</a> from 1947 to 1948. Thereafter, Fisher became general counsel of the <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a> from 1948-49. He then served as legal advisor (with the rank of Assistant Secretary of State) to the <a href="Department_of_State" title="wikilink">Department of State</a> (serving in the office of Secretary of State <a href="Dean_Acheson" title="wikilink">Dean Acheson</a>) from 1949 to 1953. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During 1952, Mr. Fisher also served as legal advisor to the U.S. Delegation to the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> in <a href="Paris,_France" title="wikilink">Paris</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1952, Fisher was also appointed by President <a href="Harry_S_Truman" title="wikilink">Harry S Truman</a> as an original commissioner to the President's <a href="Commission_on_Immigration_and_Naturalization" title="wikilink">Commission on Immigration and Naturalization</a>. The Commission was established in the <a href="Executive_Office_of_the_President" title="wikilink">Executive Office of the President</a> by Executive Order 10392 &quot;Establishing the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization&quot; <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The specific context for the 1952 commission was the enactment of the <a href="McCarren-Walter_Act" title="wikilink">McCarren-Walter Act</a>, which was passed over President Truman's veto. Truman's main disagreement with the Act was its retention of the quota system that began in 1924. After Congress passed the Act over his <a href="veto" class="uri" title="wikilink">veto</a>, he formed the Commission and charged it with looking into new options for <a href="immigration" class="uri" title="wikilink">immigration</a> and <a href="naturalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">naturalization</a> policy.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Acheson's appointment of Fisher as the State Department's <a href="Legal_Adviser" title="wikilink">Legal Adviser</a> was unique at the time, because of the closeness of the Acheson/Fisher professional relationship. Fisher's role as Acheson's legal adviser was explained by Michael H. Cordozo, the State Department's Assistant Legal Adviser for Economic Affairs, 1950-52:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Acheson) insisted on having, as a legal adviser, a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose judgment in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected. He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him in all of the political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had &quot;lost China.&quot; Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was &quot;By what authority do I sign this?&quot; And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- &quot;by what legal authority&quot; -- as well as what it provides and so forth. <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="building-the-h-bomb">Building the H-bomb</h3>
<p>In late 1949, President Truman asked <a href="Dean_Acheson" title="wikilink">Dean Acheson</a> to concentrate on the question of whether the United States should develop the <a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>. Acheson formed a working group under the <a href="United_States_National_Security_Council" title="wikilink">United States National Security Council</a> (NSC) executive secretary <a href="Sidney_Souers" title="wikilink">Sidney Souers</a>, consisting of <a href="R._Gordon_Arneson" title="wikilink">R. Gordon Arneson</a>, <a href="Paul_Nitze" title="wikilink">Paul Nitze</a> and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, &quot;The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary for any one of us to persuade anybody else; we all were of a mind that there really wasn't any choice.&quot; <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Fisher was part of this same working group which recommended that an internal <a href="NSC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NSC</a> study be conducted on the overall U.S. <a href="foreign_policy" title="wikilink">foreign policy</a> as it pertained to the newly developing &quot;<a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>&quot;. This classified study (declassified in 1977) called <a href="NSC-68" class="uri" title="wikilink">NSC-68</a>, was the blueprint for the <a href="Truman_Doctrine" title="wikilink">Truman Doctrine</a> for <a href="containment" class="uri" title="wikilink">containment</a> of <a href="communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">communism</a>, which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="congressional-hearings-on-the-firing-of-general-douglas-macarthur">Congressional Hearings on the firing of General Douglas MacArthur</h3>
<p>On <a href="April_11" title="wikilink">April 11</a>, <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, President Truman announced the dismissal of General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> from his duties as Allied Commander of <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> forces in the <a href="Far_East" title="wikilink">Far East</a>. Following MacArthur's firing and the subsequent public outcry, the Joint Committee on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a> conducted an inquiry into removal of MacArthur. Fisher was assigned the responsibility for the coordination of the <a href="State_Department" title="wikilink">State Department</a> Congressional testimony regarding the firing of General MacArthur. <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fisher-and-the-acheson-capitol-hill-fist-fight">Fisher and the Acheson Capitol Hill fist-fight</h3>
<p>In August 1950, Fisher was involved in an incident between Secretary of State <a href="Dean_Acheson" title="wikilink">Dean Acheson</a> and Senator <a href="Kenneth_S._Wherry" title="wikilink">Kenneth S. Wherry</a>, <a href="Nebraska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a> <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> and <a href="minority_whip" title="wikilink">minority whip</a> of the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a>, during a hearing before the <a href="Senate_Foreign_Relations_Committee" title="wikilink">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>. During the hearing, Senator Wherry began to harangue Acheson about events in <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>. Suddenly, Acheson jumped out of his chair towards Wherry, with fists raised. Fisher was required to physically hold Acheson back from striking Wherry. As the incident was told by eye-witness John H. Ohly, then the Assistant Director, Office of International Security Affairs, Department of State,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The next day the administration threw in its big guns -- Secretary Acheson, Louis Johnson, and, from ECA, William Foster. This time the going was really rough from the Republican side of the table and Acheson consciously lost his temper over some of Wherry's remarks and got up and tried to slug him. Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on his face on the floor. It was a great show.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>This scene was portrayed in the film &quot;<a href="The_Manchurian_Candidate" title="wikilink">The Manchurian Candidate</a>&quot;, with <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a> (as Major Marco) taking on Fisher's role of restraining (in that instance) the <a href="Secretary_of_Defense" title="wikilink">Secretary of Defense</a>. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
