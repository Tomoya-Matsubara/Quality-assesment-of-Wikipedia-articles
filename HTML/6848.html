<p>The <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a>'s <strong>102nd Intelligence Wing</strong> (<strong>102 IW</strong>), <a href="Massachusetts_Air_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Air National Guard</a>, is an <a href="Military_intelligence" title="wikilink">intelligence</a> unit located at <a href="Otis_Air_National_Guard_Base" title="wikilink">Otis Air National Guard Base</a>, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>. It is a parent unit of the <a href="101st_Intelligence_Squadron" title="wikilink">101st Intelligence Squadron</a>. From its creation in 1946 to its mission change in 2008, the 102nd was the mainstay of aerospace defence for the Northeastern United States. The 102nd was deployed during the <a href="Berlin_Crisis" title="wikilink">Berlin Crisis</a> to <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> and was also deployed to <a href="Panama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panama</a> during <a href="Operation_Coronet_Nighthawk" title="wikilink">Operation Coronet Nighthawk</a>. It also participated in <a href="Operation_Northern_Watch" title="wikilink">Operation Northern Watch</a>. During the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the 102nd Wing was the first Air Force unit to send aircraft toward <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, but they arrived too late to help stop the attacks.</p>
<p>Base downsizing through the <a href="Base_Realignment_and_Closure,_2005" title="wikilink">Base Realignment and Closure</a> (BRAC) process removed the wing's <a href="F-15C_Eagle" title="wikilink">F-15C Eagles</a> beginning in 2007, leaving the 102nd with an intelligence gathering mission that will be fully active starting in 2010. It is one of three <a href="Air_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Air National Guard</a> wings that works with the <a href="Air_Force_Intelligence,_Surveillance_and_Reconnaissance_Agency" title="wikilink">Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>After <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> ended, there was a general interest in organizing aviation assets for the National Guard system. At the time, in the US force structure aircraft were organized into infantry units in a fashion similar to other weapons, like artillery. Guard units without their own aircraft units would need units from other forces to be sent to operate with them, a situation no-one thought was promising. The <a href="War_Department" title="wikilink">War Department</a> agreed that the guard should organize aviation squadrons as an organic part of the 18 infantry divisions assigned to the National Guard.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In Massachusetts, the Archie Club, composed of former Army Air Service pilots, lobbied for the formation of an air unit for the <a href="Massachusetts_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Massachusetts National Guard</a>. The state had earlier been allotted the entire 26th Guard Division. On June 27, 1921, the Adjutant General of Massachusetts authorized the organization of the 101st Observation Squadron, and within weeks 15 veteran World War I pilots were commissioned and assigned to the 101st under the command of Capt. James K. Knowles. The 101st built its own air base on land-filled tidal flats at Jeffries Point, East Boston.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The 101 flew its <a href="Curtiss_JN-4" title="wikilink">Curtiss JN-4</a> &quot;Jenny&quot; aircraft throughout New England at air shows, county fairs and other events. In addition, the 101st attended two-week summer camps that simulated forward deployments. Pilots flew their <a href="Curtiss_O-11" title="wikilink">Curtiss O-11s</a> to temporary fields on Cape Cod while ground crews followed in trucks. One of these fields became <a href="Cape_Cod_Airport" title="wikilink">Cape Cod Airport</a>.</p>
<p>In 1933 Jeffery Field was rebuilt with new hangers and administrative buildings, and renamed <a href="Logan_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Logan Airport</a> in honor of Major General Edward L. Logan, who commanded the 26th Division from 1923 to 1928.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The 101st was ordered into state service in 1936 and 1938 during a devastating flood and hurricane to fly observation missions and to drop food and equipment to stranded fishermen and the residents of <a href="Isle_au_Haut" title="wikilink">Isle au Haut</a>, <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The 101st helped gained fame when it played a big part in the <a href="U.S._Army_Air_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Service</a>'s flight around the world. It then cared for the <a href="Spirit_of_St._Louis" title="wikilink">Spirit of St. Louis</a> when <a href="Charles_Lindbergh" title="wikilink">Charles Lindbergh</a> visited the state.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h4>
<h5 id="st-squadron">101st Squadron</h5>
<p>In 1940, the 101st was separated from the <a href="26th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">26th Infantry Division</a> and in November was ordered into active Federal service for intensive training. Initially the 101st&lt;U+2019&gt;s 25 officers and 133 enlisted men remained at home station until July 31 1941 when it was then moved from Logan to <a href="Otis_Field" title="wikilink">Otis Field</a> at <a href="Camp_Edwards" title="wikilink">Camp Edwards</a>. Otis Field was named in after 1st Lt Frank J. Otis, Jr., MD, a 101st flight surgeon who was killed in a flight accident in 1938. The 101st participated in the North Carolina maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and returned to Otis on December 6 1941.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>With the outbreak of World War II, the 101st was assigned to fly <a href="anti-submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-submarine</a> patrols off the coast of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> until September 10 1942. By then many of its original members has been reassigned during the expansion of the <a href="Army_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">Army Air Forces</a>. During the next two years, the 101st was transferred to several bases and on May 20, 1944 had its mission changed when it was re designated as the 39th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron. It was then placed under the command of the <a href="Ninth_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Ninth Air Force</a> and deployed to the European Theater in December, 1944 with 45 officers and 297 enlisted men. The 39th flew both P-38s and P-51s during operational missions from January, 1945 to the end of the war in May. The 39th returned to the states in August, 1945 and was re designated as the 101st Fighter Squadron in May 1946, and then inactivated two month later.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Veterans of the 101st and <a href="Army_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Army Air Force</a> reorganized the 101st at Logan Airport on July 29, 1946. The squadron was equipped with the <a href="P-47_Thunderbolt" title="wikilink">P-47 Thunderbolt</a> and was federally recognized on October 15, 1946.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="th-fighter-group">318th Fighter Group</h5>

<p>The 102nd Intelligence Wing can trace its roots back to the 318th Fighter Group<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. The 318th, which was formed in 1942, fought in the Pacific and was part of bomber escort missions to Japan, as well as participating in aircraft carrier takeoffs, rarely used by the <a href="Army_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Army Air Force</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. After the war, the 318th was moved to the United States. It was deactivated on January 12, 1946<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. It was reactivated as the <strong>102nd Fighter Group</strong> on May 22, 1946<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="cold-war">Cold War</h3>
<p>In the post-war era the National Guard Bureau began a major expansion of its air units. Massachusetts was allotted the 67th Fighter Wing, which consisted of the 101st and the 131st Fighter Squadrons, the 202nd Air Service Group, 601st Signal Construction Company, 101st Communications Squadron, 101st Air Control Squadron, 151st Air Control and Warning Group, 567th Air Force Band, 101st Weather Flight and the 1801st Aviation Engineer Company.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The 67th Wing was assigned to <a href="Air_Defense_Command" title="wikilink">Air Defense Command</a>.</p>
<p>With the formation of the <a href="US_Air_Force" title="wikilink">US Air Force</a> the Guard units suffered from neglect.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the midst of the switch to jet fighters, the Guard units were left with their handed-down and generally overused World War II propeller aircraft, and had little money for training. As the Cold War intensified, the Air Forced looked to the Guard to fill US-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization. On 1 Nov. 1950 the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102nd Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st along with their associated support units.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The squadrons were issued <a href="F-84B_Thunderjet" title="wikilink">F-84B Thunderjets</a>, but these aircraft were recalled and replaced by <a href="F-51_Mustang" title="wikilink">F-51 Mustangs</a> which were flown until 1954 when the <a href="F-94_Starfire" title="wikilink">F-94 Starfire</a> replaced the Twin Mustangs. In 1952 the 253d Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102nd.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1958 the Wing converted to the <a href="F-86H_Sabre" title="wikilink">F-86H Sabre</a>.</p>
<p>From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was headed by <a href="Brigadier_General_Charles_W._Sweeney" title="wikilink">Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney</a>, who piloted the <a href="B-29_Superfortress" title="wikilink">B-29 Superfortress</a>, which dropped the <a href="Fat_Man" title="wikilink">Fat Man</a> atomic bomb on <a href="Nagasaki,_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">Nagasaki, Japan</a> in 1945.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

On October 1st, the <a href="Massachusetts_Air_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Air National Guard</a>'s 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing and its three squadrons, the <a href="101st_Tactical_Fighter_Squadron" title="wikilink">101st Tactical Fighter Squadron</a>, the <a href="131st_Tactical_Fighter_Squadron" title="wikilink">131st Tactical Fighter Squadron</a>, and the <a href="138th_Tactical_Fighter_Squadron" title="wikilink">138th Tactical Fighter Squadron</a> went on active duty at <a href="Otis_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Otis Air Force Base</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the 28th and 30th of October, the 102nd TFW departed <a href="Logan_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Logan International Airport</a> to <a href="Phalsbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phalsbourg</a>, France. The wing deployed 82 Sabres across the Atlantic. In addition two <a href="C-47_Skytrain" title="wikilink">C-47 Skytrains</a> and six <a href="T-33_Shooting_Star" title="wikilink">T-33 Shooting Star</a> aircraft were assigned to the wing for support and training purposes. The 102d's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> ground forces and air interdiction. Starting on <a href="December_5" title="wikilink">December 5</a>, the 102nd began deploying to <a href="Wheelus_Air_Base" title="wikilink">Wheelus Air Base</a>, <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a> for gunnery training.</p>
<p>During its time in Europe, the 102nd participated in several <a href="USAF" class="uri" title="wikilink">USAF</a> and <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> exercises, including a deployment to <a href="Leck_Air_Base" title="wikilink">Leck Air Base</a>, <a href="West_Germany" title="wikilink">West Germany</a> near the Danish border. At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.</p>
<p>On May 7 1962, the Seventeenth Air Force stated that the 102nd would deploy back to the United States during the summer, returning in July 1962. Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated <a href="366th_Tactical_Fighter_Wing" title="wikilink">366th Tactical Fighter Wing</a>.</p>
<h4 id="relocation-to-otis">Relocation to Otis</h4>
<p><img src="too-102fw.jpg" title="fig:Older emblem of the 102d" alt="Older emblem of the 102d" /> In 1968, the 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing moved to <a href="Otis_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Otis Air Force Base</a>. The next year the wing was reassigned from <a href="Air_Defense_Command" title="wikilink">Air Defense Command</a> to <a href="Tactical_Air_Command" title="wikilink">Tactical Air Command</a>. The wing flew the <a href="F-84F_Thunderstreak" title="wikilink">F-84F Thunderstreak</a> from 1964 until June 1971, when a squadron of <a href="F-100D_Super_Sabres" title="wikilink">F-100D Super Sabres</a> was transferred directly from units fighting the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> After making the transition to the &quot;Hun,&quot; the Mach 2 <a href="F-106_Delta_Darts" title="wikilink">F-106 Delta Darts</a> soon arrived to replace them.

<p>The wing participated in the interception of Soviet <a href="TU-95_Bear" title="wikilink">TU-95 Bear</a> bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> in 1975. Many of these occasions included escorting the aircraft to <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>. Other escort missions involved the escorting of drug smuggling planes and the identifying of one mysterious ghost plane, which turned out later to be a weather balloon.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1976, the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Group was deactivated and re-formed as the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, assuming authority for the 177th and 125th Fighter Interceptor Groups in <a href="Atlantic_City,_NJ" title="wikilink">Atlantic City, NJ</a>, and <a href="Jacksonville,_FL" title="wikilink">Jacksonville, FL</a>, and for the 107th and 147th Fighter Interceptor Groups, flying <a href="F-4C_Phantom" title="wikilink">F-4C Phantom</a> at <a href="Niagara_Falls,_NY" title="wikilink">Niagara Falls, NY</a>, and <a href="Ellington_Field" title="wikilink">Ellington Field</a>, TX.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The 102nd FIW deactivated its F-106s on January 5, 1988. Between January and April 1988, the wing converted to the <a href="F-15A_Eagle" title="wikilink">F-15A Eagle</a> and resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also provided an alert detachment at <a href="Loring_AFB" title="wikilink">Loring AFB</a>.

From 1995 to 1998 the wing deployed to <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> for 45 days of air defense duty. During 1998 members both trained for and performed in real-world contingency assignments in <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>, and <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. In 1999 the wing participated in <a href="Operation_Northern_Watch" title="wikilink">Operation Northern Watch</a> when it deployed with its F-15 Eagle aircraft to <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> to patrol and enforce the no-fly zone north of the 36th Parallel in northern <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>.

Difficulties in pinpointing the exact location of Flight 11 led to a delay of five minutes before the scramble order was given at 8:43. When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two <a href="F-15_Eagles" title="wikilink">F-15 Eagles</a> that had been ordered to scramble were still on the runway at Otis; they did not take to the air until 8:52. Lacking a target, the F-15s were directed toward military-controlled airspace off the Long Island coast to avoid New York area air traffic. Uncertain about what to do, the planes were ordered to 'hold as needed' there. At 9:02, Flight 175 hit the South Tower while the fighters flew to their holding position. The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not contacted about this hijacked plane until 9:03.

The wing shared a commonality with the <a href="101st_Air_Refueling_Wing" title="wikilink">101st Air Refueling Wing</a>, the <a href="103d_Fighter_Wing" title="wikilink">103d Fighter Wing</a>, and the <a href="104th_Fighter_Wing" title="wikilink">104th Fighter Wing</a>, which due to BRAC decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to <a href="Barnes_Municipal_Airport" title="wikilink">Barnes Municipal Airport</a>. With the grounding of the <a href="F-15_Eagles" title="wikilink">F-15 Eagles</a>, the <a href="158th_Fighter_Wing" title="wikilink">158th Fighter Wing</a>, which is based in <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a> temporarily took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies. This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the <a href="104th_Fighter_Wing" title="wikilink">104th Fighter Wing</a>, created some issues. The move was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of January, but the grounding of the F-15's in late 2007 and early 2008 delayed this move to the end of February.</p>
<p><img src="DSC00772.jpg" title="fig:F-15 From 101st Fighter Squadron during the 2007 Cape Cod Airshow" alt="F-15 From 101st Fighter Squadron during the 2007 Cape Cod Airshow" /> On <a href="January_24" title="wikilink">January 24</a> <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>, the 102nd Fighter Wing flew its last patrol mission. The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11. Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="new-mission">New Mission</h4>
<p>As soon as it was announced that the wing would be kept alive and <a href="Otis_Air_National_Guard_Base" title="wikilink">Otis Air National Guard Base</a> would remain open, the state government began thinking of the future for the 102nd. There was talk among the members of the Massachusetts National Guard that it could transition to an intelligence mission so that it could help support the <a href="War_On_Terror" title="wikilink">War On Terror</a>. The plans hit a roadblock when it was announced that there were few funds left with which the wing could use to transition into its new mission.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The new mission was finally confirmed when Governor <a href="Deval_Patrick" title="wikilink">Deval Patrick</a> announced that the wing would transition to an intelligence mission as soon as the planes left. Original BRAC plans only said that a <a href="Distributed_Common_Ground_Station" title="wikilink">Distributed Common Ground Station</a> would be created at Otis. These plans didn't include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs. The issue was finally resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15's started to leave for Barnes.</p>
<p>On <a href="April_1" title="wikilink">April 1</a> <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>, the 102nd Fighter Wing was re designated as the 102nd Intelligence Wing, with a formal ceremony on <a href="April_6" title="wikilink">April 6</a>. The wing will reach full operation in 2010.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> By October 1st, the wing is expected to be operationally ready.</p>
<p>During the time preceding the wing reaching full operational capacity, members of the wing had the option of moving with the F-15s to Barnes. Most members decided to stay behind and train for their new missions. The crash trucks moved with the F-15s to Barnes, leaving the <a href="brush_breaker" title="wikilink">brush breakers</a> of the <a href="Massachusetts_Military_Reservation" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Military Reservation</a> behind. The buildings formally occupied by the planes will be reused for the intelligence mission by wing members. These buildings include the hangers that the F-15s formally occupied.</p>
