The plot further develops due to the presence of the <a href="federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal government of the United States</a> and their scientific researchers.</p>
<p><em>Close Encounters</em> was a long-cherished project that had been enshrined since Spielberg's childhood. In late-1973, he developed a deal with <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a> for a science fiction film. <a href="Paul_Schrader" title="wikilink">Paul Schrader</a>, <a href="John_Hill_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">John Hill</a>, <a href="David_Giler" title="wikilink">David Giler</a>, <a href="Hal_Barwood" title="wikilink">Hal Barwood</a>, <a href="Matthew_Robbins_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">Matthew Robbins</a> and <a href="Jerry_Belson" title="wikilink">Jerry Belson</a> contributed with script writing work, alongside Spielberg. In the end Spielberg was given solo writing credit.</p>
<p>Filming began in May 1976, where problems occurred such as the film's production budget, <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> and the <a href="shooting_schedule" title="wikilink">shooting schedule</a>. <a href="Douglas_Trumbull" title="wikilink">Douglas Trumbull</a> served as the <a href="visual_effects_supervisor" title="wikilink">visual effects supervisor</a>, while <a href="Carlo_Rambaldi" title="wikilink">Carlo Rambaldi</a> designed the aliens. <em>Close Encounters</em> was released with financial and critical success. The film was <a href="reissue" title="wikilink">reissued</a> in 1980 as <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition</em>. The film received numerous awards and nominations at the <a href="50th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">50th Academy Awards</a>, <a href="32nd_British_Academy_Film_Awards" title="wikilink">32nd British Academy Film Awards</a>, the <a href="Saturn_Award" title="wikilink">Saturn Awards</a> and has been widely acclaimed by the <a href="American_Film_Institute" title="wikilink">American Film Institute</a>. <em>Close Encounters</em> has also led to the development of the unproduced film <em><a href="Night_Skies" title="wikilink">Night Skies</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Sonoran_Desert" title="wikilink">Sonoran Desert</a>, Claude Lacombe (<a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Truffaut" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Truffaut</a>) and David Laughlin (<a href="Bob_Balaban" title="wikilink">Bob Balaban</a>), along with other government scientific researchers discover a <a href="Flight_19" title="wikilink">lost squadron</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a>. The aircraft are still and intact and perfectly operational, but the pilots have disappeared. In <a href="Air_Traffic_Control" title="wikilink">Air Traffic Control</a> <a href="Indianapolis,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>, two flights have a <a href="near_miss_(safety)" title="wikilink">near miss</a> with a <a href="Unidentified_flying_object" title="wikilink">UFO</a>. In <a href="Muncie,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Muncie, Indiana</a>, three year-old Barry Guiler (<a href="Cary_Guffey" title="wikilink">Cary Guffey</a>) is led out of his house when his toys start operating automatically, forcing his mother Gillian (<a href="Melinda_Dillon" title="wikilink">Melinda Dillon</a>) to chase after him. During a large-scale <a href="power_outage" title="wikilink">power outage</a>, <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> <a href="lineman_(occupation)" title="wikilink">electrical lineman</a> Roy Neary (<a href="Richard_Dreyfuss" title="wikilink">Richard Dreyfuss</a>) experiences a <a href="close_encounter#Second_kind" title="wikilink">close encounter of the second kind</a>, and is soon caught in a motorized pursuit of four UFOs. He becomes obsessed with UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Neary (<a href="Teri_Garr" title="wikilink">Teri Garr</a>).</p>
<p>Roy begins seeing the image and soon begins making <a href="scale_model" title="wikilink">scale models</a> of a distinctive <a href="butte" class="uri" title="wikilink">butte</a>, a place he has never seen and is unfamiliar with. Gillian also becomes obsessed with the mental picture of a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, Gillian witnesses a UFO landing, in which Barry is abducted by unseen beings. After Roy's increasingly <a href="eccentricity_(behavior)" title="wikilink">eccentric behavior</a> causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her, he sees the feature he has been modeling on a television news show: <a href="Devils_Tower_National_Monument" title="wikilink">Devils Tower National Monument</a> in <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>. Guiler also sees the same news broadcast, and both Roy and Jillian, as well as others with similar experiences, obsessively head toward the site. Elsewhere in the world, the pace of UFO activity is increasing; Lacombe and Laughlin investigate a host of occurrences along with other <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> experts. Eyewitnesses report the UFOs to make distinctive sounds: a five-tone motif.</p>
<p>After Laughlin recognizes a signal from <a href="outer_space" title="wikilink">outer space</a> as a set of geographical coordinates pointing to Devils Tower, all parties begin to converge on Wyoming. The <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">United States Army</a> evacuates the area, using false reports that a train wreck has spilled highly dangerous <a href="nerve_gas" title="wikilink">nerve gas</a>, all the while preparing a landing zone for the first human contact with the UFOs and their occupants. While the other humans drawn to the site are unable to reach Devils Tower, Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site as dozens of UFOs appear. The enormous <a href="mother_ship" title="wikilink">mother ship</a> lands, returning people who had been <a href="alien_abduction" title="wikilink">abducted</a> over the years, including Barry. With an understanding of peace between the two civilizations, Roy is taken onboard the ship as an ambassador from Earth, and one of the UFO occupants comes out to greet the humans. Lacombe communicates with it by using the hand signs that are used to create the five tones in the human contact. The UFO occupant does the same and smiles before it boards back on the ship, which then lifts off.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>The genesis of <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> started when <a href="Steven_Spielberg" title="wikilink">Steven Spielberg</a>, as a young boy, and his father saw a <a href="meteor_shower" title="wikilink">meteor shower</a> in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As a teenager, Spielberg completed the full-length <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction film</a> <em><a href="Firelight_(1964_film)" title="wikilink">Firelight</a></em>. Many scenes from <em>Firelight</em> would be incorporated in <em>Close Encounters</em> on a <a href="shot-for-shot" class="uri" title="wikilink">shot-for-shot</a> basis.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 1970 he wrote a <a href="short_story" title="wikilink">short story</a> called <em>Experiences</em> about a <a href="lover&#39;s_lane" title="wikilink">lover's lane</a> <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwestern United States</a> farming community and a &quot;light show&quot; a group of teenagers see in the night sky.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In late-1973, during <a href="post-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-production</a> on <em><a href="The_Sugarland_Express" title="wikilink">The Sugarland Express</a></em>, Spielberg developed a deal with <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a> for a science fiction film. <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a> previously turned down the offer.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Julia_Phillips" title="wikilink">Julia</a> and <a href="Michael_Phillips" title="wikilink">Michael Phillips</a> instantly signed on as producers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>He first considered doing a documentary about people who believed in <a href="Unidentified_flying_object" title="wikilink">UFO</a>'s, or a low-budget feature film. Spielberg decided &quot;a film that depended on <a href="state_of_the_art" title="wikilink">state of the art</a> technology couldn't be made for $2.5 million.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Borrowing a phrase from the ending of <em><a href="The_Thing_from_Another_World" title="wikilink">The Thing from Another World</a></em>, he retitled the film <em>Watch the Skies</em>, rewriting the premise concerning <a href="Project_Blue_Book" title="wikilink">Project Blue Book</a> and <a href="pitch_(filmmaking)" title="wikilink">pitching</a> the concept to <a href="Willard_Huyck" title="wikilink">Willard Huyck</a> and <a href="Gloria_Katz" title="wikilink">Gloria Katz</a>.

I go, 'Steve, that's the worst idea I ever heard.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Spielberg brought <a href="Paul_Schrader" title="wikilink">Paul Schrader</a> to write the script in December 1973 with <a href="principal_photography" title="wikilink">principal photography</a> to begin in late-1974. Spielberg went to work on <em><a href="Jaws_(film)" title="wikilink">Jaws</a></em>, pushing <em>Watch the Skies</em> back.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>With the financial and critical success of <em>Jaws</em>, Spielberg earned a vast amount of creative control from Columbia, declaring the right to make the film any way he wanted.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, &quot;one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned into a <a href="major_film_studio" title="wikilink">major film studio</a> or director.

He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15-years trying to make contact.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring <a href="John_Hill_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">John Hill</a> to rewrite.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> At one point the main character was a <a href="police_officer" title="wikilink">police officer</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Spielberg &quot;[found] it hard to identify with men in uniform.

<p><a href="David_Giler" title="wikilink">David Giler</a> performed a rewrite. <a href="Hal_Barwood" title="wikilink">Hal Barwood</a> and <a href="Matthew_Robbins_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">Matthew Robbins</a>, friends of Spielberg, suggested the <a href="plot_device" title="wikilink">plot device</a> of a kidnapped child. Spielberg then began to write the script. The song &quot;<a href="When_You_Wish_upon_a_Star" title="wikilink">When You Wish upon a Star</a>&quot; from <em><a href="Pinocchio_(1940_film)" title="wikilink">Pinocchio</a></em> highly influenced Spielberg's writing style. &quot;I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <a href="Jerry_Belson" title="wikilink">Jerry Belson</a> and Spielberg wrote the <a href="shooting_script" title="wikilink">shooting script</a> together.

Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another <a href="blockbuster_(entertainment)" title="wikilink">blockbuster</a> after <em>Jaws</em>, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The US Air Force and <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a> refused to cooperate on the film.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Principal_photography" title="wikilink">Principal photography</a> began on May 16, 1976. Spielberg did not want to do any <a href="location_shooting" title="wikilink">location shooting</a> because of his negative experience on <em>Jaws</em> and wanted to shoot <em>Close Encounters</em> entirely on <a href="sound_stage" title="wikilink">sound stages</a>.

<p><em>Close Encounters</em> is the first collaboration between <a href="Michael_Kahn_(film_editor)" title="wikilink">Michael Kahn</a> and Spielberg. Their relationship continued for the rest of Spielberg's films.

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>Film critic Charlene Engel observed <em>Close Encounters</em> &quot;suggests that humankind has reached the point where it is ready to enter the community of the cosmos. While it is a computer interface which makes the final musical conversation with the alien guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devil's Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The film also evokes typical <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a href="archetype" title="wikilink">archetypes</a> and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Other critics found a variety of Christian analogies. Devil's Tower parallels <a href="Mount_Sinai" title="wikilink">Mount Sinai</a>, the aliens as Gods and Roy Neary as <a href="Moses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moses</a>. <a href="Cecil_B._DeMille" title="wikilink">Cecil B.

Some found close relations between <a href="Ezekiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ezekiel</a> and Roy; Ezekiel was taken into a &quot;chariot of fire&quot;, akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devil's Tower behind Jillian and faltering, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to <a href="Lot_(Bible)" title="wikilink">Lot</a>'s wife who looked back at <a href="Sodom_and_Gomorrah" title="wikilink">Sodom</a> and turned into a pillar of salt.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Spielberg explained, &quot;I wanted to make <em>Close Encounters</em> a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it in to complete upheaval as her starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Roy's wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when his is sculpting a huge model of Devil's Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <em>Close Encounters</em> also studies the form of &quot;youth spiritual yearning&quot;. Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as &quot;Toys&quot;, serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance. &quot;If we can talk to aliens in <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>,&quot; he said, &quot;why not with the <a href="Communism" title="wikilink">Reds</a> in the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>?&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devil's Tower.

<p>On the <a href="final_cut_privilege" title="wikilink">final cut privilege</a>, Spielberg was dissatisfied with <em>Close Encounters</em>. &quot;Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately,&quot; Spielberg explained. &quot;Anyway, <em>Close Encounters</em> was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted to make my own <a href="director&#39;s_cut" title="wikilink">director's cut</a>. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the <a href="mother_ship" title="wikilink">mother ship</a> so they could have something to &quot;campaign&quot; on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In 1979, Columbia Pictures gave Spielberg $2.5 million to start <a href="reissue" title="wikilink">reissueing</a> the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but the reissue was still three minutes shorter than the theatrical release.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>It featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the <em><a href="SS_Cotopaxi" title="wikilink">SS Cotopaxi</a></em> in the <a href="Gobi_Desert" title="wikilink">Gobi Desert</a>, and a view of the inside of the mother ship. <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition</em> was released on January 1, 1980, making a further $15.7 million, accumulating a final $303.79 million box office gross.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> &quot;thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth.

<p><em>Close Encounters</em> was given a 2-disc DVD release in August 2002, which contained the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="James_Berardinelli" title="wikilink">James Berardinelli</a> felt &quot;<em>Close Encounters</em> is still unquestionably a great movie. Its universal appeal gave movie-goers something to be excited about during 1977-78 as the first in a wave of post-<em>Star Wars</em> <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction films</a> broke. Today, the movie stands up remarkably well.

<p>When asked in 1991 to select a single &quot;master image&quot; that summed up his film career, Spielberg chose the shot of Barry opening his living room door to see the blazing orange light from the UFO. &quot;That was beautiful but awful light, just like fire coming through the doorway.&quot; Spielberg continued. &quot;He's very small, and it a very large door, and there's a lot of promise or danger outside that door.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In 2007, <em>Close Encounters</em> was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the <a href="United_States_Library_of_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Library of Congress</a>, and was added to the <a href="National_Film_Registry" title="wikilink">National Film Registry</a> for preservation.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In <a href="American_Film_Institute" title="wikilink">American Film Institute</a> polls, <em>Close Encounters</em> has been voted the sixty-fourth <a href="AFI&#39;s_100_Years..._100_Movies" title="wikilink">greatest film of all time</a>,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> thirty-first <a href="AFI&#39;s_100_Years..._100_Thrills" title="wikilink">most thrilling</a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and fifty-eighth <a href="AFI&#39;s_100_Years..._100_Cheers" title="wikilink">most uplifting</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
