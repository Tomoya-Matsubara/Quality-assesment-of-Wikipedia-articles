<p><strong>Rachel Chiesley</strong>, usually known as <strong>Lady Grange</strong> (1679–1745), was the wife of <a href="James_Erskine,_Lord_Grange" title="wikilink">James Erskine, Lord Grange</a>, a <a href="Scottish_people" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> lawyer with <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> sympathies. After 25 years of marriage and 9 children, the Granges had an acrimonious separation. After Lady Grange produced letters that she claimed were evidence of his <a href="treason" title="wikilink">treasonable</a> plottings against the <a href="House_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Hanoverian</a> government in London, her husband had her kidnapped in 1732. She was incarcerated in various remote locations on the western seaboard of Scotland, including the <a href="Monach_Isles" title="wikilink">Monach Isles</a>, <a href="Skye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skye</a> and the distant islands of <a href="St_Kilda,_Scotland" title="wikilink">St Kilda</a>.</p>
<p>Lady Grange's father was convicted of murder and she is known to have had a violent temper; initially her absence seems to have caused little comment. News of her plight eventually reached her home town of <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> however, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was effected by her lawyer, Thomas Hope of Rankeillor. She died in captivity, after being in effect imprisoned for 13 years. Her life has been remembered in poetry, prose and a play.</p>

<p>Rachel Chiesley was one of ten children born to John Chiesley of <a href="Dalry,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Dalry</a> and Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for <a href="alimony" class="uri" title="wikilink">alimony</a>. She was awarded 1,700 <a href="Merk_(coin)" title="wikilink">merks</a> by <a href="George_Lockhart_(advocate)" title="wikilink">Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath</a>, the <a href="Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session" title="wikilink">Lord President of the Court of Session</a>.

His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Chiesley's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then, making her about ten years old at the time of her father's execution.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The young Lady Grange has been described as a &quot;wild beauty&quot;, and it is likely the marriage only took place after she became <a href="pregnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnant</a>. This uncertain background notwithstanding, Lord and Lady Grange led a superficially uneventful domestic life. They divided their time between a town house at the foot of Niddry's Wynd off the High Street in Edinburgh and an estate at <a href="Preston,_East_Lothian" title="wikilink">Preston</a> (near <a href="Prestonpans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prestonpans</a> in <a href="East_Lothian" title="wikilink">East Lothian</a>), where Lady Grange was the <a href="Factor_(agent)" title="wikilink">factor</a> (or supervisor) for a time.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Her husband was a successful lawyer, becoming <a href="Lord_Justice_Clerk" title="wikilink">Lord Justice Clerk</a> in 1710,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the marriage produced nine children:</p>

<li>Rachel</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition, Lady Grange <a href="miscarriage" title="wikilink">miscarried</a> twice and one of the above children is known to have died in 1721.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>However, there was an element of discord below the surface. In late 1717 or early 1718, Erskine received warnings from a friend that he had enemies in the government. At about the same time one of the children's tutors recorded in his diary that Lady Grange was &quot;imperious with an unreasonable temper&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Her outbursts were evidently also capable of frightening her younger daughters and it is a remarkable aspect of the story that no action was ever taken by any of Lady Grange's children on her behalf after her kidnapping, the eldest of whom would have been in their early twenties when she was abducted. This may become easier to understand with the knowledge that their mother had previously disinherited all of them, when the youngest were still infants.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="kidnap">Kidnap</h2>
<p>As the Erksine marriage's trouble increased, Lady Grange's behaviour became increasingly unpredictable. In 1730, the factorship of the Preston estate was removed from her, further increasing her angst. Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with a Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse. In April of that year, she threatened suicide and to run naked through the streets of Edinburgh. She may have kept a razor under her pillow and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was. On 27 July, she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> For example, she barracked her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion. She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason. She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry's Wynd, waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions. In January 1732 she booked a <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> to London and James Erskine and his friends, afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble, decided it was time to take decisive action.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <img src="Simon_Fraser,_11th_Lord_Lovat_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_20947.jpg" title="fig:Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, one of the organisers of Lady Grange&#39;s kidnapping" alt="Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, one of the organisers of Lady Grange&#39;s kidnapping" /> She was abducted from her home on the night of 22 January by two <a href="Scottish_Highlands" title="wikilink">Highland</a> noblemen, Roderick MacLeod of <a href="Berneray,_North_Uist" title="wikilink">Berneray</a> and Macdonald of <a href="Morar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morar</a> and several of their men. After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a <a href="litter_(vehicle)" title="wikilink">sedan chair</a> and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near <a href="Falkirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Falkirk</a>, where she was held until 15 August on the ground floor of an uninhabited tower.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> She was by now over fifty years old. </p>
<p>From there she was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of <a href="Simon_Fraser,_11th_Lord_Lovat" title="wikilink">Lord Lovat</a>) and his men through Perthshire. At <a href="Balquhidder" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balquhidder</a>, according to <a href="Clan_Gregor" title="wikilink">MacGregor</a> tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The existence of <a href="Fillan" title="wikilink">St Fillan's</a> Pool on the River Fillan near <a href="Tyndrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyndrum</a> would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through <a href="Glen_Coe" title="wikilink">Glen Coe</a> to <a href="Loch_Ness" title="wikilink">Loch Ness</a> and then through Glen Garry to <a href="Loch_Hourn" title="wikilink">Loch Hourn</a> on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the <a href="Monach_Isles" title="wikilink">Monach Isles</a>. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was in the company of men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all. Their native <a href="Scottish_Gaelic" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that &quot;they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="monach-isles">Monach Isles</h2>

<p>The <a href="Monach_Isles" title="wikilink">Monach Isles</a>, also known as Heisker, lie  west of <a href="North_Uist" title="wikilink">North Uist</a> in the <a href="Outer_Hebrides" title="wikilink">Outer Hebrides</a>, an archipelago itself lying off the western coast of Scotland. The main islands are <a href="Ceann_Ear" title="wikilink">Ceann Ear</a>, <a href="Ceann_Iar" title="wikilink">Ceann Iar</a> and <a href="Shivinish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shivinish</a>, which are all linked at <a href="low_tide" title="wikilink">low tide</a> and have a combined area of .

When she complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes, or food other than the normal fare he and his wife were used to. She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="st-kilda">St Kilda</h2>
<p>One of the more poignant ruins on the island of <a href="Hirta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hirta</a> in the St Kilda archipelago is the site of Lady Grange's House.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The &quot;house&quot; is in fact a large cleit or stone storage hut in the Village meadows which is said to resemble &quot;a giant Christmas pudding&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Some authorities believe it was rebuilt on the site of a larger <a href="black_house" title="wikilink">black house</a> where she lived during her incarceration there,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> although in 1838 the grandson of a St Kildan who had assisted her quoted the dimensions as being &quot;20 feet by 10 feet&quot; (7 metres by 3 metres), which is roughly the size of the cleit.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <img src="Village_Bay_St_Kilda10.jpg" title="fig:A cleit on Hirta" alt="A cleit on Hirta" /> Hirta is an order of magnitude more remote than the Monach Isles, lying  west-northwest of <a href="Benbecula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benbecula</a> in the <a href="North_Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Ocean</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When <a href="Martin_Martin" title="wikilink">Martin Martin</a> visited the islands in 1697,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> the only means of making the journey was by open longboat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the open ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. In all seasons, waves up to 12 metres (40 ft) high lash the beach of Village Bay, and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous. Cut off by distance and weather, the natives knew little of the rest of the world.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Lady Grange's circumstances were correspondingly more uncomfortable. She described Hirta as &quot;a viled neasty, stinking poor Isle&quot; and insisted that &quot;I was in great miserie in the Husker but I'm ten times worse and worse here&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Her lodgings were very primitive. They had an earthen floor, rain ran down the walls and in winter snow had to be scooped out in handfuls from behind the bed.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> She spent her days asleep, drank as much whisky as was available to her, and wandered the shore at night bemoaning her fate. During her sojourn on Hirta she wrote two letters relating her story, which eventually reached Edinburgh. One, dated 20 January 1738, found its way to Thomas Hope of Rankeillor, her lawyer, in December 1740. The letter caused a sensation in Edinburgh but James Erskine's friends managed to block attempts by Hope to obtain a warrant to search St Kilda.{{#tag:ref|In 1732 Lord Lovat had written &quot;But as to that insolent fellow Mr Hope of Eankiller, I would advise him to to [not to] meddle with me, for the moment that I can prove that he attacts my character and reputation by any calumnie I'l certainly pursue him for <em>Scandalum Magnatum</em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> |group=&quot;Note&quot;}} <img src="Saint_Kilda_archipelago_topographic_map-fr.svg" title="fig:The St Kilda archipelago" alt="The St Kilda archipelago" /> In the second letter, addressed to Dr Carlyle, minister of <a href="Inveresk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inveresk</a>, Lady Grange writes bitterly of the roles of Lord Lovat and Roderick McLeod in her capture and bemoans being described by Sir Alexander MacDonald as &quot;the cargo&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|No original survives of the second letter, and a copy published in 1819 is dated 1741, which makes little sense as it relates to her time on St Kilda.

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>By any standards, Lady Grange's story is a remarkable one and several key questions require explanation. Firstly, what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths? Secondly, why were so many individuals willing to participate in this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife, and thirdly how was she held for so long without rescue?</p>
<p>The first and second questions are related. Erskine's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites.

It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry.

The <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a> were very remote from the <a href="English-speaking_world" title="wikilink">anglophone</a> world in the early 18th century and no reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776.{{#tag:ref|The failure of the British navy to capture <a href="Charles_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> after the <a href="Battle_of_Culloden" title="wikilink">Battle of Culloden</a> in 1745 was a major factor in the creation of a new <a href="Nautical_chart" title="wikilink">rutter</a> by Murdoch Mackenzie, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, called <em>A Nautical Description</em> researched from 1748 to 1757 and published in 1776. <a href="Johan_Blaeu" title="wikilink">Johan Blaeu</a>'s 1654 map was the best available of the area at the time, but even this was not available to the Hanoverian government and military at the time.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve one of their own is remarkable. The <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Kirk</a> hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, it is clear that John Chiesley's daughter did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>There is also little doubt that 18th-century attitudes to women in general were a significant factor. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to <a href="witchcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">witchcraft</a>. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale from the perspective of the descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence in alcohol were clearly important factors in her undoing. <a href="Alexander_Carlyle" title="wikilink">Alexander Carlyle</a> described her as &quot;stormy and outrageous&quot;, whilst noting that it was in her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Macauley (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in <a href="Haymarket,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Haymarket, Edinburgh</a>), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="James_Boswell" title="wikilink">Boswell</a> and <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Johnson</a> discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: &quot;After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange&lt;U+2019&gt;s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M&lt;U+2019&gt;Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.&quot;{{#tag:ref|In an additional note Boswell added: &quot;The true story of this lady, which happened In this century, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy. She was the wife of one of the Lords of Session in Scotland, a man of the very first blood of his country. For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom, and by nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland shores, from whence she was transported by sea to the remote rock of St Kilda, where she remained, amongst its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn prisoner, but had a constant supply of provisions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till she at last found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechist who concealed it in a clue of yarn. Information being thus obtained at Edinburgh, a ship was sent to bring her off; but intelligence of this being received, she was conveyed to M&lt;U+2019&gt;Leod&lt;U+2019&gt;s island of Herries, where she died.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}</p>
