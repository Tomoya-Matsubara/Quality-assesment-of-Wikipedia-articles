<p><img src="SENSOR_logo.jpg" title="fig:SENSOR-Pesticides Logo" alt="SENSOR-Pesticides Logo" /> <strong>Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)-Pesticides</strong> is a U.S. state-based <a href="Clinical_surveillance" title="wikilink">surveillance</a> program that monitors <a href="pesticide" class="uri" title="wikilink">pesticide</a>-related illness and injury. It is administered by the <a href="National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health" title="wikilink">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH), twelve <a href="State_health_agency" title="wikilink">state health agencies</a> participate. NIOSH provides technical support to all participating states. It also provides funding to some states, in conjunction with the <a href="US_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">US Environmental Protection Agency</a> (US EPA).</p>
<p>Pesticide-related illness is a significant occupational health issue, but it is believed to be underreported. Because of this, NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program to track pesticide poisonings. Because workers in many industries are at risk for pesticide exposure, and public concern exists regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides, government and regulatory authorities experience pressure to monitor health effects associated with them. SENSOR-Pesticides state partners collect case data from several different sources using a standard case definition and set of variables. This information is then forwarded to the program headquarters at NIOSH where it is compiled and put into a national database.</p>
<p>Researchers and government officials from the SENSOR-Pesticides program have published research articles that highlight findings from the data and their implications for environmental and occupational pesticide issues. These issues include eradication of invasive species, <a href="pesticide_poisoning" title="wikilink">pesticide poisoning</a> in schools, <a href="birth_defect" title="wikilink">birth defects</a>, and residential use of <a href="fogger" title="wikilink">total release foggers</a>, or &quot;bug bombs,&quot; which are devices that release an insecticide mist.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Although it is a significant occupational health issue, work-related pesticide poisoning is believed to be under-reported.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Before the SENSOR program began, state programs that collected reports of occupational diseases did not usually conduct interventions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While over 25 states required reporting of pesticide-related illness, most of them could not compile useful information on incidence or prevalence.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In response to these challenges, NIOSH proposed the SENSOR program as a model to track certain occupational conditions, including pesticides.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Epagraph-pesticideuse.png" title="fig:Pesticide usage in the U.S., 2001." alt="Pesticide usage in the U.S., 2001." width="400" /> Pesticide poisoning is an important occupational health issue because pesticides are used in a large number of industries, which puts many different categories of workers at risk. From 1995 to 2001, use in agriculture accounted for at least 70% of conventional pesticide use in the U.S.,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the <a href="US_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">US EPA</a> estimates that the agricultural sector has had a similar market share of pesticides since 1979.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Pesticides are particularly useful in agriculture because they increase <a href="crop_yields" title="wikilink">crop yields</a> and reduce the need for manual labor.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> However, this extensive use puts agricultural workers at increased risk for pesticide illnesses.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Workers in other industries are at risk for exposure as well.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> For example, commercial availability of pesticides in stores puts retail workers at risk for exposure and illness when they handle pesticide products.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The ubiquity of pesticides puts emergency responders such as fire-fighters and police officers at risk, because they are often the first responders to emergency events and may be unaware of the presence of a poisoning hazard.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The process of <a href="aircraft_disinsection" title="wikilink">aircraft disinsection</a>, in which pesticides are used on inbound international flights for insect and disease control, can also make flight attendants sick.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The widespread use of pesticides, their release into the environment, and the potential for adverse public health effects due to exposure may raise public concern.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Some feel that regulatory authorities have an ethical obligation to track the health effects of such chemicals.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><embed src="SENSOR-Pesticides_state_participation_2009.PNG&lt;U+200E&gt;" title="fig:Map of SENSOR-Pesticides participating states " /> Beginning in 1987, NIOSH supported the implementation of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) program in ten state health departments. The objectives of the program were to help state health departments to develop and refine reporting systems for certain occupational disorders so that they could conduct and evaluate <a href="health_intervention" title="wikilink">interventions</a> and prevention efforts. The disorders covered by SENSOR included <a href="silicosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">silicosis</a>, <a href="occupational_asthma" title="wikilink">occupational asthma</a>, <a href="carpal_tunnel_syndrome" title="wikilink">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, <a href="lead_poisoning" title="wikilink">lead poisoning</a>, and <a href="pesticide_poisoning" title="wikilink">pesticide poisoning</a>. While each participating state health department had previously done surveillance or interventions for some of these occupational illnesses, SENSOR helped the states to develop and refine their reporting systems and programs.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The original SENSOR-Pesticides model was based on physician reporting. Each state contacted a select group of sentinel health care professionals on a regular basis to collect information.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> However, this system was labor-intensive and did not yield many cases.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Because different states used different methods for collecting information, their data could not be compiled or compared to analyze for trends.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In response, NIOSH, along with other federal agencies (US EPA, National Center for Environmental Health), non-federal agencies (CSTE, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics), and state health departments, developed a standard <a href="case_definition" title="wikilink">case definition</a> and a set of standardized variables.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> As of 2009, SENSOR-Pesticides had 12 participating states contributing occupational pesticide-related injury and illness data: <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, <a href="Iowa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iowa</a>, <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, and <a href="Washington_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a> received federal funding to support surveillance activities, while <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>, and <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> were unfunded SENSOR-Pesticides program partners.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>
<p>A case of pesticide-related illness or injury is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms that are temporally related to a pesticide exposure.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Cases are classified as occupational if exposure occurs at work, unless the case was a suicide or an attempted suicide.</p>
<p>Cases are reportable when:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is documentation of new adverse health effects temporally related to a documented pesticide exposure AND</li>
<li>there is consistent evidence of a causal relationship between the pesticide and the health effects based on the known toxicology of the pesticide OR</li>
<li>there is not enough information to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the health effects.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>State public health officials rate each case as definite, probable, possible or suspicious. Illness severity is assigned as low, moderate, severe, or fatal.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>All states in the program require physicians to report pesticide-related injuries and illnesses; however, most states collect the majority of their data from <a href="Workers&#39;_compensation" title="wikilink">workers&lt;U+2019&gt; compensation</a> claims, <a href="American_Association_of_Poison_Control_Centers" title="wikilink">poison control centers</a>, and state agencies with jurisdiction over pesticide use, such as state <a href="Department_of_agriculture" title="wikilink">departments of agriculture</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> When they receive a report, health department officials review the information to determine whether it was pesticide related. If it was, they request medical records and try to interview the patient (or a proxy) and anyone else involved in the incident (e.g. supervisors, applicators, and witnesses). The data is compiled each year and put into a <a href="national_database" title="wikilink">national database</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying, classifying, and tabulating pesticide poisoning cases, the states periodically investigate pesticide-related events and develop interventions aimed at particular industries or pesticide hazards.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>Federal and state-level scientists and researchers with SENSOR-Pesticides have published articles on pesticide exposure events and trends using program data. These articles include MMWR publications<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and articles in peer-reviewed journals on exposures such as acute pesticide-related illness in youth,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> agricultural workers,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> retail workers,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> migrant farm workers,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and flight attendants.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Several articles have attracted media attention and motivated legislative or other governmental action.</p>
