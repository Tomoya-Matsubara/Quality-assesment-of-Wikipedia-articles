<p>After switching to cable cars in 1890 it was acquired by the Rock Creek Railway in 1895 and the new company was named the <strong>Capital Traction Company</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1897 Capital Traction built the Georgetown Car Barn (&quot;Capital Traction Company&quot; is still written above the main door).</p>
<h4 id="metropolitan-railroad-company">Metropolitan Railroad Company</h4>

<p>Founded in 1870. It started opearations in 1872 at <a href="New_York_Avenue_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">New York Avenue NW</a> and 15th St NW, and ran east along New York Avenue NW to K Street NW, along <a href="K_Street_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">K Street NW</a> to <a href="Massachusetts_Avenue_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Avenue NW</a>, along Massachusetts Avenue NW to H Street NW, and along H Street to Benning Road NE (Formerly Columbia Pike).

In 1898, the route was extended out Benning Road NE to the <a href="Deanwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deanwood</a> neighborhood. This extension was built as an electric line, and in 1899, the rest of the cable car line was converted to <a href="electricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">electricity</a>.

<h4 id="eckington-and-soldiersu2019-home-railway-company">Eckington and Soldiers&lt;U+2019&gt; Home Railway Company</h4>
<p>The first electric streetcar in D.C. was run by the <a href="Eckington,_Washington,_DC" title="wikilink"> Eckington</a> and Soldiers' Home Railway. It was chartered on June 19, 1888 and started operation later that year. It started at 7th &amp; New York Ave. NW, east of Mt Vernon Square and travelled a distance of 2 &lt;U+00BD&gt; miles to the Eckington Car barn at 4th and T NE via Boundary Street, Eckington Place, R Street, 3rd and T Street. A one week pass cost $1.25. In 1889 it was extended to Glenwood Cemetery and in 1895 to Soldiers' Home. The Glenwood Cemetery extension was shut down in 1894. In 1898, it merged with the <strong>City and Suburban Railway</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="brightwood-railway-company">Brightwood Railway Company</h4>
<p>On October 18, 1888, Congress authorized the Brightwood Railway Company to build a streetcar line on <a href="Georgia_Avenue" title="wikilink">Georgia Avenue</a> (then known as Seventh Street Extended or Brightwood Avenue) from <a href="Florida_Avenue" title="wikilink">Florida Avenue</a> (Boundary Street) to the District line at Silver Spring. Four of the five founders were partners in the Petworth subdivision, including the line's president, A. A. Thomas.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Railroad Company had run a horse-drawn line on Georgia Avenue to Rock Creek Church Road since about 1873. The Metropolitan was authorized to run the streetcar line all the way to the District boundary, but the area was sparsely developed and the horsedrawn cars offered a long, slow trip to and from the city. Business was slow. So the Brightwood Railway Company bought the Metropolitan's Georgia Avenue line in 1890 and electrified it. Because all wiring in the city was required to be underground the line used storage battery cars. Maximum fare was 5 cents/passenger or 6 tickets for 25 cents.</p>
<p>The Brightwood line was extended to Takoma Park in 1892. In 1895 the <strong>Washington, Woodside and Forest Glen Railway and Power Company</strong> was organized to carry the Brightwood line into Montgomery County.</p>

<h4 id="capital-railway-company">Capital Railway Company</h4>
<p>The Capital Railway Company was the first electric railway line to cross the <a href="Anacostia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anacostia</a>. It was incorporated in 1895 and ran over the newly constructed bridge at Pennsylvania Avenue and along Nichols (now Martin Luther King) Avenue past St. Elisabeths.

<h4 id="washington-railway-and-electric-company-capital-traction-company">Washington Railway and Electric Company &amp; Capital Traction Company</h4>
<p>In 1900, Congress passed the Reorganization Act. This paved the way for an extensive series of mergers and acquisitions, through which ownership of all streetcars in Washington was divided between two companies: the Washington Railway and Electric Company' and the Capital Traction Company. The Washington Railway and Electric Company had been formed in 1900 for just this purpose. The combined system reached its greatest size in 1915.</p>
<p>In 1925, the <a href="North_American_Company" title="wikilink">North American Company</a> acquired, through stock purchase, a <a href="controlling_interest" title="wikilink">controlling interest</a> in the Washington Railway and Electric Company and a <a href="minority_interest" title="wikilink">minority interest</a> in Capital Traction. At about this time, the system (as in other cities) began to decline in quality and ridership because of competition from the private automobile and buses. At the time, streetcars were viewed by many as old fashioned, impractical and less desirable than buses. With the coming of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink"> Depression</a>, revenues and maintenance suffered. Unlike today, most transit systems were privately owned and received no government subsidy.</p>

<p>On April 4, 1896 The Maryland and Washigton, having difficulty raising money, merged with several other struggling streetcar companies to create the <strong>Columbia and Maryland Railway</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the City and Suburban was laying down track, reaching Mount Rainier in 1897. In 1898 it merged with the <strong>Eckington &amp; Soldiers Home Railroad</strong>. It continued building tracks, now into Maryland, reaching Brentwood in 1898; and Hyattsville and Riverdale in 1899.</p>
<p>The Columbia and Maryland renamed itself the <strong>Berwyn and Laurel Electric Railroad Company</strong> and started building tracks from the end of the City and Suburban in Riverdale to College Park and Laurel by 1902 - at which time it changed its name again, this time to the <strong>Washington, Berwyn and Laurel Electric Railroad Company</strong>.</p>
<p>Eventually, the City and Suburban took over control of the Washington, Berwyn and Laurel until it was itself absorbed by the <strong>Washington Railway and Electric Company</strong>. It had stops in the following cities.</p>

It ran from a car barn at 15th and H Street, NE in Washington along <a href="Bladensburg_Road" title="wikilink">Bladensburg Road</a> to <a href="Bladensburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bladensburg</a>. The line was initially planned to run as far as <a href="Gettysburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gettysburg</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> but service was only extended as far as <a href="Berwyn_Heights,_Maryland" title="wikilink"> Berwyn Heights</a> (This happened in 1912 using battery cars). The line became the <strong>Washington Interurban Railway</strong> in 1912 and the <strong>Washington Interurban Railroad Company</strong> in 1916. In 1923 the streetcars were replaced by buses and the tracks removed when Bladensburg Road was paved.</p>

<p>Beginning on July 2, 1913, this single-track line began operating from a junction with the <strong>Tenallytown and Rockville Railroad</strong> at Bradley Lane in Bethesda and ran on the north side of the road to River Road. From there, it ran on its own right of way to Great Falls. Service was discontinued on February, 12 1921, and the tracks were removed in 1926.</p>

<p><img src="DC_Streetcar_construction.JPG" title="fig:Underground conduit system at 14th &amp; G Streets, NW" alt="Underground conduit system at 14th &amp; G Streets, NW" width="225" /> The first streetcars were pulled by horses. Later, <a href="cable_cars" title="wikilink">cable cars</a> were used. By 1900, all trains were powered by electricity. Because <a href="overhead_wires" title="wikilink">overhead wires</a> were forbidden, <a href="trolley_cars" title="wikilink">trolley cars</a> were not used, and instead all Washington streetcars were <a href="conduit_car" title="wikilink">conduit cars</a>, where electric power was delivered to the cars by way of an underground delivery system that can be thought of as a &quot;<a href="third_rail" title="wikilink">third rail</a>&quot; but was in fact technologically different. The streetcar drew power from this mechanism through a <a href="Plough#Other_uses" title="wikilink">plow</a>, an electrical contact which was attached to the underside of the carriage and extended more than one foot beneath the surface of the street through a slot running down the middle of the track. This technology was used only in Washington, <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, and <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.</p>
<p>Because the underground conduit system was much more expensive to build than a typical trolley system, the ban on overhead wires applied only to what was then the city of Washington. The ban did not apply to the rest of the District. To accommodate this hybrid power system, Washington streetcars had a <a href="trolley_pole" title="wikilink">trolley pole</a> attached to the top of the cars for use outside of the city center. When leaving downtown, the cars would stop at a <strong>plow pit</strong>, a manned space under the tracks, where the plow could be removed by the pitman. At the same time, the conductor would attach the trolley pole to the overhead wires. See photo of a plow pit <a href="http://www.davesrailpix.com/dct/htm/dct301.htm">here</a>.</p>
