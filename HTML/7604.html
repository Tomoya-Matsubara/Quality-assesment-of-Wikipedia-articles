<p><strong>Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico</strong> (Emperador Maximiliano I de M&lt;U+00E9&gt;xico) (<a href="July_6" title="wikilink">July 6</a>, <a href="1832" class="uri" title="wikilink">1832</a> – <a href="June_19" title="wikilink">June 19</a>, <a href="1867" class="uri" title="wikilink">1867</a>) (born Ferdinand <em>Maximilian</em> Joseph) was a member of <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>'s Imperial <a href="Habsburg-Lorraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Habsburg-Lorraine</a> family. With the backing of <a href="Napoleon_III" title="wikilink">Napoleon III</a> of <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> and a group of Mexican conservatives, he was proclaimed <a href="Emperor_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Emperor of Mexico</a> on <a href="April_10" title="wikilink">April 10</a>, <a href="1864" class="uri" title="wikilink">1864</a>. Many foreign governments refused to recognize his government, especially the United States; this ensured the success of Republican forces led by <a href="Benito_Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez" title="wikilink">Benito Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez</a>, and Maximilian was executed, after his capture by Mexican Republicans, in Quer&lt;U+00E9&gt;taro in 1867.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p><img src="Maximiliaan_van_Oostenrijk.jpg" title="fig:Maximiliaan_van_Oostenrijk.jpg" alt="Maximiliaan_van_Oostenrijk.jpg" width="175" /> Maximilian was born in <a href="Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nbrunn_Palace" title="wikilink">Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;nbrunn</a>, <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, the second son of <a href="Archduke_Franz_Karl_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Archduke Franz Karl of Austria</a> and his wife <a href="Sophie,_Princess_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Sophie Friederike Dorothee Wilhelmine, Princess of Bavaria</a>. His siblings were Emperor <a href="Franz_Josef_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Franz Josef of Austria</a> (sometimes identified by the English spelling Francis Joseph), <a href="Archduke_Karl_Ludwig_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Karl Ludwig</a>, Archduchess Maria Anna Caroline Pia and <a href="Archduke_Ludwig_Viktor" title="wikilink">Archduke Ludwig Viktor</a>. Maximilian was born as <strong>His Imperial and Royal Highness Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph, Prince Imperial and Archduke of Austria, Prince Royal of <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> and <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There is well-documented suspicion that Maximilian was not the product of a union between Princess Sophie and Franz Karl. Many Europeans, and Viennese in particular, suspected that he was actually fathered by <a href="Napoleon_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Napoleon II</a> (son of Napoleon I and Marie Louise of Austria as Napoleon Francois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, also known as the Duke of Reichstadt). Those who subscribe(d) to this belief cite(d) the unnaturally close relationship that existed between Sophie and Napoleon II (it was said that Sophie never recovered after his death and that she blamed it on Metternich for the rest of her life) and that, from birth, Maximilian's stature resembled Napoleon II's more than than that of Franz Karl, his older brother, and his younger brothers. (See Maximilian and Carlota by Gene Smith, ISBN-10: 0245524185, ISBN-13: 978-0245524189, and Maximilian and Juarez by Jasper Ridley, ISBN-0-89919-989-5)</p>
<p>He was a particularly clever boy, showing considerable taste for the <a href="arts" class="uri" title="wikilink">arts</a> and displaying an early interest in <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a>, especially <a href="botany" class="uri" title="wikilink">botany</a>. He was trained for the <a href="navy" class="uri" title="wikilink">navy</a>, and threw himself into this career with so much zeal that he quickly rose to high command, and was instrumental in creating the naval port of <a href="Trieste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trieste</a>  and the fleet with which Admiral <a href="Wilhelm_von_Tegetthoff" title="wikilink">Wilhelm von Tegetthoff</a> won his victories in the <a href="Austro-Prussian_War" title="wikilink">Italian War</a>. Very much influenced by the progressive ideas in vogue at the time, he had some reputation as a <a href="Liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a>, and this led, in February <a href="1857" class="uri" title="wikilink">1857</a>, to his appointment as viceroy of the <a href="Kingdom_of_Lombardy-Venetia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia</a>.</p>
<p>He married Princess <a href="Charlotte_of_Belgium" title="wikilink">Charlotte of Belgium</a> (also known as <a href="Empress" class="uri" title="wikilink">Empress</a> Carlota of Mexico), daughter of <a href="Leopold_I_of_Belgium" title="wikilink">Leopold I, King of the Belgians</a>, on <a href="July_27" title="wikilink">July 27</a>, <a href="1857" class="uri" title="wikilink">1857</a>, in <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>They lived as the Austrian regents in <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a> until <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a> when Emperor Franz Josef dismissed Maximilian. The emperor was angered by the liberal policies pursued by his brother in Italy. Shortly after Maximilian's dismissal, Austria lost control of most of its Italian possessions. He then retired into private life, chiefly at Trieste, near which he built the beautiful castle <a href="Miramare" title="wikilink">Miramar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="offer-of-a-mexican-crown">Offer of a Mexican crown</h2>
<p><img src="Maximilian_of_Mexico_Winterhalter.jpg" title="fig:Portrait of Maximilian I of Mexico, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter" alt="Portrait of Maximilian I of Mexico, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter" /> In <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a> he was first approached by Mexican monarchists with a proposal to become the <a href="Emperor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emperor</a> of <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. He did not accept at first, but sought to satisfy his restless desire for adventure with a botanical expedition to the tropical forests of <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>. However, after the <a href="French_intervention_in_Mexico" title="wikilink">French intervention in Mexico</a>, under pressure from <a href="Napoleon_III" title="wikilink">Napoleon III</a> and after General <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;lie-Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Forey" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;lie-Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Forey</a>'s capture of <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> and the <a href="plebiscite" class="uri" title="wikilink">plebiscite</a> which confirmed his proclamation of the empire, he consented to accept the crown in <a href="1863" class="uri" title="wikilink">1863</a> (Maximilian was not told of the dubious nature of the plebiscite, which was held while French troops were occupying most of the territory). His decision involved the loss of all his noble rights in Austria, though he was not informed of this until just before he left. Archduchess Charlotte was thereafter known as &quot;Her Imperial Majesty Empress Carlota&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="emperor-of-mexico">Emperor of Mexico</h2>
<p><img src="Catedral_de_M&lt;U+00E9&gt;xico.jpg" title="fig:Maximilian and Carlota planned to be crowned in 1864 at La Catedral Metropolitana in Mexico City." alt="Maximilian and Carlota planned to be crowned in 1864 at La Catedral Metropolitana in Mexico City." width="310" /> Maximilian landed at <a href="Veracruz_(city)" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a> on <a href="May_28" title="wikilink">May 28</a>, <a href="1864" class="uri" title="wikilink">1864</a> with the backing of Mexican conservatives and <a href="Napoleon_III" title="wikilink">Napoleon III</a>; but from the very outset he found himself involved in serious difficulties since the Mexican liberals, led by <a href="Benito_Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez" title="wikilink">Benito Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez</a>, refused to recognize his rule. There was continuous warfare between his French troops and the Mexican republicans.</p>
<p>The Imperial couple chose as their seat Mexico City. The Emperor and Empress set up their residence at <a href="Chapultepec_Castle" title="wikilink">Chapultepec Castle</a>, located on the top of a hill formerly at the outskirts of <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> that had been a retreat of <a href="Aztec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aztec</a> emperors. Maximilian ordered a wide avenue cut through the city from <a href="Chapultepec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chapultepec</a> to the city center; originally named Avenue of the Empress, it is today Mexico City's famous <em><a href="Paseo_de_la_Reforma" title="wikilink">Paseo de la Reforma</a></em> (The Reform Promenade). They made plans to be crowned at the <a href="Mexico_City_Metropolitan_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Catedral Metropolitana</a>, but the coronation was never actually carried out, due to constant instability of the regime.</p>
<p>As Maximilian and Carlota had no children, they adopted <a href="Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_de_Iturbide_y_Green" title="wikilink">Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Iturbide y Green</a> and his cousin <a href="Salvador_de_Iturbide_y_de_Marz&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Salvador de Iturbide y de Marz&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>, both grandsons of <a href="Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_de_Iturbide" title="wikilink">Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Iturbide</a>, who had briefly reigned as Emperor of Mexico in the 1820s. They gave young Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n the title of &quot;His Highness, the Prince of Iturbide&quot; and intended to groom him as heir to the throne.</p>
<p>To the dismay of his conservative allies, Maximilian upheld several liberal policies proposed by the Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez administration – such as land reforms, religious freedoms, and extending the right to vote beyond the landholding class. At first Maximilian offered Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez an amnesty if he would swear allegiance to the crown, which Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez refused. Later Maximilian ordered all captured followers of Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez to be shot,in response to the republican practice of executing everyone who was a supporter of the Empire. In the end,it proved to be a tactical mistake that only exacerbated opposition to his regime.</p>
<p>After the end of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> began supplying arms to the republicans. By <a href="1866" class="uri" title="wikilink">1866</a> the imminence of Maximilian's <a href="abdication" class="uri" title="wikilink">abdication</a> was apparent to almost everyone outside Mexico.</p>
<p>In <a href="1866" class="uri" title="wikilink">1866</a> Napoleon III withdrew his troops in the face of Mexican resistance and U.S. opposition under the <a href="Monroe_Doctrine" title="wikilink">Monroe Doctrine</a>, but the main reason was to increase his military contingent at home to face the ever growing German power of <a href="Bismarck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bismarck</a>. Carlota travelled to <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, seeking assistance for her husband's regime in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and Vienna and, finally, in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> from <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a> <a href="Pope_Pius_IX" title="wikilink">Pius IX</a>. Her efforts failed, and she suffered a profound emotional collapse (some say insanity) and never went back to Mexico. After her husband was executed by Mexican republicans the following year, she spent the rest of her life in seclusion, first at <a href="Miramare_Castle" title="wikilink">Miramare Castle</a> near <a href="Trieste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trieste</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, and then at <a href="Bouchout_Castle" title="wikilink">Bouchout Castle</a> in <a href="Meise" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meise</a>, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, where she died on <a href="January_19" title="wikilink">January 19</a>, <a href="1927" class="uri" title="wikilink">1927</a>.</p>

<p>Though urged to abandon Mexico by Napoleon III himself, whose withdrawal from Mexico was a great blow to the Mexican Imperial cause, Maximilian refused to desert his followers. Withdrawing, in February <a href="1867" class="uri" title="wikilink">1867</a>, to <a href="Santiago_de_Quer&lt;U+00E9&gt;taro" title="wikilink">Quer&lt;U+00E9&gt;taro</a>, he sustained a <a href="Quer&lt;U+00E9&gt;taro_siege" title="wikilink">siege</a> for several weeks, but on 11 May resolved to attempt an escape through the enemy lines. However the city fell on <a href="May_15" title="wikilink">May 15</a>, <a href="1867" class="uri" title="wikilink">1867</a>, before he could carry out this plan, and he was captured. Following a <a href="court-martial" class="uri" title="wikilink">court-martial</a>, he was sentenced to death. Many of the crowned heads of Europe and other prominent figures (including the eminent liberals <a href="Victor_Hugo" title="wikilink">Victor Hugo</a> and <a href="Giuseppe_Garibaldi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>) sent telegrams and letters to Mexico pleading for Maximilian's life to be spared, but Ju&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez refused to commute the sentence, believing that it was necessary to send a message that Mexico would not tolerate any government imposed by foreign powers.</p>
<p>The sentence was carried out on <a href="June_19" title="wikilink">June 19</a>, <a href="1867" class="uri" title="wikilink">1867</a>, when Maximilian was executed (together with his generals <a href="Miguel_Miram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Miguel Miram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> and <a href="Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s_Mej&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" title="wikilink">Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Mej&lt;U+00ED&gt;a</a>) by a firing squad. His last words were reported to be &quot;Mexicans! today I die for a fair cause: the freedom and Independence of Mexico. May god allow my spilling blood to put an end forever to the disgraces of my new homeland.&lt;U+00A1&gt;Viva M&lt;U+00E9&gt;xico!&quot;. <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/81/5545.htm">1</a> Although he bribed the seven riflemen not to shoot him in the head, one did anyway. Maximilian's body was embalmed and displayed in Mexico before being buried in the <a href="Imperial_Crypt" title="wikilink">Imperial Crypt</a> in <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, early the following year.</p>
