<p><strong>Suicide</strong> (<a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>suicidium</em>, from <em>sui caedere</em>, &quot;to kill oneself&quot;) is the act of intentionally causing one's own <a href="death" class="uri" title="wikilink">death</a>. Suicide is often committed out of <a href="Despair_(emotion)" title="wikilink">despair</a>, or attributed to some underlying <a href="mental_disorder" title="wikilink">mental disorder</a> which includes <a href="major_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">depression</a>, <a href="bipolar_disorder" title="wikilink">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href="schizophrenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="alcoholism" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholism</a> and <a href="drug_abuse" title="wikilink">drug abuse</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Pressures or misfortunes such as <a href="financial_difficulties" title="wikilink">financial difficulties</a> or troubles with <a href="interpersonal_relationship" title="wikilink">interpersonal relationships</a> may play a significant role.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Over one million people die by suicide every year. The <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) estimates that it is the thirteenth-leading cause of death worldwide<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The rate of suicide is far higher in men than in women, with males worldwide three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year worldwide.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Views on suicide have been influenced by broader cultural views on existential themes such as <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a>, <a href="honor" class="uri" title="wikilink">honor</a>, and the <a href="meaning_of_life" title="wikilink">meaning of life</a>. The <a href="Abrahamic_religion" title="wikilink">Abrahamic religions</a> consider suicide an <a href="sin" title="wikilink">offense towards God</a> due to religious belief in the <a href="sanctity_of_life" title="wikilink">sanctity of life</a>. It was often regarded as a serious <a href="Legal_views_of_suicide" title="wikilink">crime</a> and that view is common in modern Western thought. Before the rise of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, suicide was not seen as automatically immoral in ancient <a href="Suicide_in_antiquity" title="wikilink">Greek and Roman</a> culture. Conversely, during the <a href="samurai" class="uri" title="wikilink">samurai</a> era in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="seppuku" class="uri" title="wikilink">seppuku</a> was respected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest. <a href="Sati_(practice)" title="wikilink">Sati</a> is a <a href="Hindu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> <a href="funeral" class="uri" title="wikilink">funeral</a> practice, now outlawed, in which the <a href="Widow#Widows_in_Indian_culture" title="wikilink">widow</a> was expected to <a href="self-immolation" title="wikilink">immolate</a> herself on her husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from the family and in-laws.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the 20th century, suicide in the form of <a href="self-immolation" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-immolation</a> has been used as a form of protest, and in the form of <a href="kamikaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">kamikaze</a> and <a href="suicide_bombing" title="wikilink">suicide bombing</a> as a military or terrorist tactic.</p>

<h3 id="self-harm">Self-harm</h3>

<p><a href="Self-harm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Self-harm</a> is not a suicide attempt; however, initially self-harm was erroneously classified as a suicide attempt. There is a non-causal correlation between self-harm and suicide; both are most commonly a <a href="joint_effect" title="wikilink">joint effect</a> of <a href="clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This may also be classified as Deliberate self-harm and is most common in younger people but has been increasing in recent years in people of all ages.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide">Euthanasia and assisted suicide</h3>

The other person, usually a family member or physician, may help carry out the act if the individual lacks the physical capacity to do so even with the supplied means. Assisted suicide is a contentious moral and political issue in many countries, as seen in the scandal surrounding <a href="Jack_Kevorkian" title="wikilink">Dr. Jack Kevorkian</a>, a <a href="physician" title="wikilink">medical practitioner</a> who supported <a href="euthanasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">euthanasia</a>, was found to have helped patients end their own lives, and was sentenced to prison time.</p>
<h3 id="murderu2013suicide">Murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide</h3>

<p>A murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide is an act in which an individual kills one or more other persons immediately before or at the same time as him or herself.</p>
<p>The motivation for the murder in murder&lt;U+2013&gt;suicide can be purely criminal in nature or be perceived by the perpetrator as an act of care for loved ones in the context of severe <a href="clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>.</p>
<h3 id="suicide-attack">Suicide attack</h3>

<p>A suicide attack is when an attacker perpetrates an act of violence against others, typically to achieve a military or political goal, which results in his or her own death as well. Suicide bombings are often regarded as an act of <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a>. Historical examples include the <a href="assassination" class="uri" title="wikilink">assassination</a> of <a href="Alexander_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Czar Alexander II</a> and the partly successful <a href="kamikaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">kamikaze</a> attacks by Japanese air pilots during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, as well as more recent attacks, such as the <a href="September_11th_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11th attacks</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mass-suicide">Mass suicide</h3>

<p>Some suicides are done under <a href="peer_pressure" title="wikilink">peer pressure</a> or as a group. Mass suicides can take place with as few as two people, in a &quot;suicide pact&quot;, or with a larger number of people. An example is the mass suicide that took place by members of the <a href="Peoples_Temple" title="wikilink">Peoples Temple</a>, an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="cult" class="uri" title="wikilink">cult</a> led by <a href="Jim_Jones" title="wikilink">Jim Jones</a> in <a href="Guyana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guyana</a> in 1978.</p>
<h3 id="suicide-pact">Suicide pact</h3>

<p>A suicide pact describes the suicides of two or more individuals in an agreed-upon plan. The plan may be to die together, or separately and closely timed. Suicide pacts are generally distinct from mass suicide. The latter refers to incidents in which a larger number of people kill themselves together for the same ideological reason, often within a religious, political, military or paramilitary context. Suicide pacts, on the other hand, usually involve small groups of people (such as married or romantic partners, family members, or friends) whose motivations are intensely personal and individual.</p>
<h2 id="risk-factors">Risk factors</h2>
<p><img src="Suicide_circumstances.gif" title="fig:A representative listing of circumstances for suicide in 16 states in the United States. The chart does not include all possible circumstances." alt="A representative listing of circumstances for suicide in 16 states in the United States. The chart does not include all possible circumstances." width="350" /> A number of factors are associated with the risk of suicide including: <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mental illness</a>, <a href="drug_addiction" title="wikilink">drug addiction</a>, availability of methods, family history, and socio-economic factors.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> While external circumstances, such as a <a href="psychological_trauma" title="wikilink">traumatic</a> event, may trigger suicide it does not seem to be an independent cause.</p>
<h3 id="mental-disorders">Mental disorders</h3>
<p><a href="Mental_disorder" title="wikilink">Mental disorders</a> are frequently present at the time of suicide. It is estimated that from 87%<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> to 98% of suicide victims suffer from some type of mental disorder.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> When broken down into type of mental disorder among suicides, <a href="mood_disorders" title="wikilink">mood disorders</a> are present in 30%, <a href="substance_abuse" title="wikilink">substance abuse</a> in 18%, <a href="schizophrenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">schizophrenia</a> in 14%, and <a href="personality_disorders" title="wikilink">personality disorders</a> in 13% of suicides.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> About 5% of people with schizophrenia die of suicide.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The disorders most associated with completed suicide are major depression and alcoholism. In people with <a href="mood_disorder" title="wikilink">mood disorders</a> (major depressive disorders and bipolar disorders) the risk for suicide is approximately 15 percent, with the greatest risk in the early stages of the illness.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Depression, one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> is being diagnosed in increasing numbers in various segments of the population worldwide,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and is often a precipitating factor in suicide. Depression in the United States alone affects 17.6 million Americans each year or 1 in 6 people. Within the next twenty years depression is expected to become the second leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause in high-income nations, including the United States.</p>
<h3 id="substance-abuse">Substance abuse</h3>
<p><a href="Substance_abuse" title="wikilink">Substance abuse</a> is the second most common <a href="risk_factor" title="wikilink">risk factor</a> for suicide after <a href="mood_disorders" title="wikilink">mood disorders</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Both chronic substance misuse as well as acute substance abuse are associated with suicide. This is attributed to the intoxicating and disinhibiting effects of many psychoactive substances; when combined with personal grief such as bereavement the risk of suicide is greatly increased.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> More than 50% of suicides are related to alcohol or drug use and up to 25% of suicides are committed by drug addicts and alcoholics. In adolescents the figure is higher with alcohol or drug misuse playing a role in up to 70% of suicides. It has been recommended that all drug addicts or alcoholics undergo investigation for suicidal thoughts due to their high risk of suicide.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> An investigation in the New York Prison Service found that 90% of inmates who committed suicide had a history of substance abuse.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <a href="Cigarette" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cigarette</a> smoking is also associated.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="cocaine">Cocaine</h4>
<p>Misuse of drugs such as <a href="cocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cocaine</a> have a high correlation with suicide. Suicide is most likely to occur during the &quot;crash&quot; or withdrawal phase of cocaine in chronic cocaine-dependent users. Polysubstance misuse has been found to more often result in suicide in younger adults whereas suicide from alcoholism is more common in older adults. In <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> it was found that 30% of suicides in people under the age of 30 had used cocaine. In <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> during a crack epidemic one in five people who committed suicide were found to have recently consumed cocaine. The &quot;come down&quot; or withdrawal phase from cocaine can result in intense depressive symptoms coupled with other distressing mental effects which contribute to the increased risk of suicide.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="opioids">Opioids</h4>
<p><a href="Heroin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heroin</a> users have a death rate 13 times that of their peers, and deaths among heroin users attributed to suicide range from 3 to 35%.

<h4 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h4>

<p>Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of mental health disorders, and alcoholics have a very high suicide rate.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It has been found that drinking 6 drinks or more per day results in a sixfold increased risk of suicide.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> High rates of <a href="major_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">major depressive disorder</a> occur in heavy drinkers and those who misuse alcohol. Controversy has previously surrounded whether those who misused alcohol who developed major depressive disorder were <a href="self_medication" title="wikilink">self medicating</a> (which may be true in some cases) but recent research has now concluded that chronic excessive alcohol intake itself directly causes the development of <a href="major_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">major depressive disorder</a> in a significant number of alcoholics.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="benzodiazepines">Benzodiazepines</h4>

<p>Chronic prescribed <a href="benzodiazepine" class="uri" title="wikilink">benzodiazepine</a> use or chronic misuse is associated with depression as well as suicide.

<p>An <a href="evolutionary_psychology" title="wikilink">evolutionary psychology</a> explanation for suicide is that suicide may under some circumstances improve the reproductive success of relatives of the person committing suicide and thus also the overall reproductive success (<a href="inclusive_fitness" title="wikilink">inclusive fitness</a>) of the person committing suicide. This may occur if the person committing suicide will not have more children (even if not committing suicide) and takes away resources from relatives by staying alive. This theory predicts that suicide may be especially likely if a person perceives that he or she is a burden to others, especially relatives, and with no hope of future improvement. In support of this several studies have found that perceived burdensomeness to others is a strong predictor of suicidal thoughs, suicidality, lethality of suicide method, and successful suicide. Joiner et al. argue that there is also other research that is be consistent with the theory such that &quot;genuine suicide attempts were often characterize by a desire to make others better off, whereas nonsuicidal self-injury was often characterized by desires to express anger or punish oneself.&quot; An objection is that while some suicides may increase the inclusive fitness of a person, in other cases, such as healthy adolescents committing suicide, this likely decrease overall reproductive success even if also including the reproductive success of relatives. A response is that such cases may be due malfunctioning psychological mechanisms (in the sense of increasing inclusive fitness). Evolutionary psychology argue that many human psychological features are <a href="adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptations</a> to the ancestral envrionment which was very different from the current one. Psychological mechanisms that may have usually increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment may not do so in today's environment.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Dutiful suicide is an act, or non-fatal attempt at the act, of fatal self-violence at one's own hands done in the belief that it will secure a greater good, rather than to escape harsh or impossible conditions. It can be voluntary, to relieve some dishonor or punishment, or imposed by threats of death or reprisals on one's family or reputation (a kind of murder by <a href="remote_control" title="wikilink">remote control</a>). It can be culturally traditional or generally abhorred; it can be heavily ritualized as in seppuku or purely functional. Dutiful suicide can be distinguished from a kamikaze or suicide bomb attack, in which a fighter consumes his own life in delivering a weapon to the enemy.</p>
<p>Disgraced <a href="Nobiles" title="wikilink">Roman aristocrats</a> were sometimes allowed to commit suicide to spare themselves a trial and penalties against their families.

<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>

<p><img src="United_States_Army_Suicide_Prevention_Poster.jpg" title="fig:A United States Army suicide prevention poster" alt="A United States Army suicide prevention poster" /> Suicide prevention is a term used for the collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through prevention measures. Various strategies involving restricting the access to most common methods of suicide, such as firearms or toxic substances like pesticides, have proved to be effective in reducing suicide rates. Studies supported by empirical data have indicated that that adequate prevention, diagnosis and treatment of depression and alcohol and substance abuse can reduce suicide rates, as well as follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> While <a href="crisis_hotline" title="wikilink">crisis hotlines</a> are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>The Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention is a registry of various suicide intervention programs maintained by the American Association of Suicide Prevention. The programs are divided, with those in Section I listing <a href="Evidence-based_practice" title="wikilink">evidence-based</a> programs: interventions which have been subjected to indepth review and for which evidence has been proven that they demonstrated positive outcomes, those in Section III are programs which have been subjected to review.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="screening">Screening</h3>
<p>The U.S. Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at risk of suicide may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> There are various screening tools in the form of self-report <a href="questionnaire" title="wikilink">questionnaires</a> to help identify those at risk such as the <a href="Beck_Hopelessness_Scale" title="wikilink">Beck Hopelessness Scale</a> and <a href="Is_Path_Warm?" title="wikilink">Is Path Warm?</a>. A number of these self-report questionnaires have been tested and found to be valid for use among adolescents and young adults.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> There is however a high rate of false-positive identification and those deemed to be at risk should ideally have a follow-up interview. The predictive quality of these screening questionnaires has not been conclusively validated so it is not possible to determine if those identified at risk of suicide will actually commit suicide.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Asking about or screening for suicide does not appear to increase the risk.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>In approximately 75% of completed suicides the individuals had seen a physician within the prior year before their death, 45%-66% within the prior month. Approximately 33% - 41% of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year, 20% within the prior month.

<p>In the U.S., the rate of suicide is increasing for the first time in a decade. The increase in the overall suicide rate between 1999 and 2005 has been due primarily to an increase in suicides among whites aged 40&lt;U+2013&gt;64, with white <a href="middle-aged" class="uri" title="wikilink">middle-aged</a> women experiencing the largest annual increase.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>


<p>In the Western world, males die much more often by means of suicide than do females, although females attempt suicide more often. Some medical professionals believe this stems from the fact that males are more likely to end their lives through effective violent means, while women primarily use less severe methods such as overdosing on medications. In most countries, drug overdoses account for about two-thirds of suicides among women and one-third among men.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

About 15% of alcoholics commit suicide, and about 33% of suicides in the under 35's have a primary diagnosis of alcohol or other substance misuse; over 50% of all suicides are related to alcohol or drug dependence.

<p>The predominant view of <a href="medicine" title="wikilink">modern medicine</a> is that suicide is a <a href="mental_health" title="wikilink">mental health</a> concern, associated with factors such as difficulty coping with <a href="clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a> or other <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mental disorders</a>, or pressures such as inescapable <a href="suffering" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffering</a> or <a href="fear" class="uri" title="wikilink">fear</a>. A suicide attempt is sometimes interpreted as a cry for help or attention, or an expression of <a href="Despair_(emotion)" title="wikilink">despair</a> and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Most people who attempt suicide do not complete suicide on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions have a significantly higher probability of eventual completion of suicide.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>In the United States, individuals who express the intent to harm themselves may be automatically determined to lack the <em>present mental capacity</em> to refuse treatment, and can be transported to the <a href="emergency_room" title="wikilink">emergency department</a> against their will. An <a href="emergency_physician" title="wikilink">emergency physician</a> will determine whether inpatient care at a <a href="psychiatric_hospital" title="wikilink">mental health care facility</a> is warranted.

A court hearing may be held to determine the individual's <em><a href="competence_(law)" title="wikilink">competence</a></em>. In most states, a <a href="psychiatrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychiatrist</a> may hold the person for a specific time period without a judicial order. If the psychiatrist determines the person to be a threat to himself or others, the person may be admitted involuntarily to a <a href="psychotherapy" title="wikilink">psychiatric treatment</a> facility. This period is usually of three days duration. After this time the person must be discharged or appear in front of a judge.

<p>In most forms of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, suicide is considered a <a href="sin" class="uri" title="wikilink">sin</a>, based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, such as <a href="St._Augustine" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="St._Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>; suicide was not considered a sin under the <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> Christian <a href="code_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">code of Justinian</a>, for instance.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> In <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> doctrine, the argument is based on the <a href="Ten_Commandments" title="wikilink">commandment</a> &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; (made applicable under the <a href="New_Covenant" title="wikilink">New Covenant</a> by <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a> in <a href="Gospel_of_Matthew" title="wikilink">Matthew 19:18</a>), as well as the idea that life is a gift given by <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> which should not be spurned, and that suicide is against the &quot;natural order&quot; and thus interferes with God's master plan for the world.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> However, it is believed that mental illness or grave fear of suffering diminishes the responsibility of the one completing suicide.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Counter-arguments include the following: that the <a href="Ten_Commandments" title="wikilink">sixth commandment</a> is more accurately translated as &quot;thou shalt not murder&quot;, not necessarily applying to the self; that God has given free will to humans; that taking one's own life no more violates God's Law than does curing a <a href="disease" class="uri" title="wikilink">disease</a>; and that a number of suicides by followers of God are recorded in the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> with no dire condemnation.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a> focuses on the importance of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or <a href="mass_suicide" title="wikilink">mass suicide</a> (see <a href="Masada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Masada</a>, <a href="History_of_the_Jews_in_France#First_persecution_of_the_Jews" title="wikilink">First French persecution of the Jews</a>, and <a href="York_Castle" title="wikilink">York Castle</a> for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for &quot;when the knife is at the throat&quot;, for those dying &quot;to sanctify God's Name&quot;. (See: <em><a href="Martyrdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Martyrdom</a></em>). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded both as examples of heroic martyrdom, whilst others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>Suicide is not allowed in <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a>;<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> however, martyring oneself for Allah (during combat) is not considered the same as completing suicide. Suicide in Islam is seen as a sign of disbelief in God.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Hinduism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hinduism</a>, suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. <a href="Hindu_texts" title="wikilink">Hindu Scriptures</a> state that one who commits suicide will become part of the spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not committed suicide.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> However, Hinduism accept a man's <a href="right_to_die" title="wikilink">right to end one's life</a> through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed <em><a href="Prayopavesa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prayopavesa</a></em>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> <a href="Jainism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jainism</a> has a similar practice named <em><a href="Santhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Santhara</a></em>. <a href="sati_(practice)" title="wikilink">Sati</a>, or self-immolation by widows was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p><embed src="The_way_out.jpg&lt;U+200E&gt;" title="fig:The Way Out, or Suicidal Ideation: George Grie, 2007." /> Some see suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice and a human right (colloquially known as the <a href="right_to_die" title="wikilink">right to die</a> movement), and maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age that have no possibility of improvement. Proponents of this view reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. This perspective is most popular in <a href="continental_Europe" title="wikilink">continental Europe</a>, where euthanasia and other such topics are commonly discussed in parliament and has a good deal of support.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>A narrower segment of this group considers suicide something between a grave but condonable choice in some circumstances and a <a href="sacrosanct" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacrosanct</a> right for anyone (even a young and healthy person) who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives. Notable supporters of this <a href="school_(discipline)" title="wikilink">school of thought</a> include German <a href="pessimist" class="uri" title="wikilink">pessimist</a> philosopher <a href="Arthur_Schopenhauer" title="wikilink">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="wikilink">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and Scottish empiricist <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume</a>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Bioethicist <a href="Jacob_M._Appel" title="wikilink">Jacob Appel</a> has become the leading advocate for this position in the United States.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Adherents of this view often advocate the abrogation of statutes that restrict the liberties of people known to be suicidal, such as laws permitting their involuntary commitment to mental hospitals.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>

<p>Some landmarks have become known for high levels of suicide attempts. The four most popular locations in the world are reportedly <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="wikilink">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>'s <a href="Bloor_Street_Viaduct" title="wikilink">Bloor Street Viaduct</a> (before the construction of the <a href="Luminous_Veil" title="wikilink">Luminous Veil</a>),<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>'s <a href="Aokigahara" title="wikilink">Aokigahara Forest</a> and <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>'s <a href="Beachy_Head" title="wikilink">Beachy Head</a>.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In 2005 the Golden Gate Bridge had a count exceeding 1,200 jumpers since its construction in 1937,<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> in 1997 the Bloor Street Viaduct had one suicide every 22 days,<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> and in 2002 Aokigahara had a record of 78 bodies found within the forest, replacing the previous record of 73 in 1998.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The suicide rate of these places is so high that numerous signs, urging potential victims of suicide to seek help, have been posted.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="advocacy-of-suicide">Advocacy of suicide</h3>

<p>Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many <a href="culture" title="wikilink">cultures</a> and <a href="subculture" title="wikilink">subcultures</a>. The <a href="Japanese_military" title="wikilink">Japanese military</a> during World War II encouraged and glorified <a href="kamikaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">kamikaze</a> attacks, and Japanese society as a whole has been described as suicide 'tolerant' (see <a href="Suicide_in_Japan" title="wikilink">Suicide in Japan</a>).</p>
<p><a href="William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel" title="wikilink">William Francis Melchert-Dinkel</a>, 47 years old in May 2010, from <a href="Faribault,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Faribault, Minnesota</a>, a licensed nurse from 1991 until February 2009, stands accused of encouraging people to commit suicide while he watched on a <a href="webcam" class="uri" title="wikilink">webcam</a>.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a><a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>A study by the <a href="British_Medical_Journal" title="wikilink">British Medical Journal</a> found that Web searches for information on suicide are likely to return sites that encourage, and even facilitate, suicide attempts.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> There is some concern that such sites may push the suicidal over the edge.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Some people form <a href="suicide_pact" title="wikilink">suicide pacts</a> with people they meet online.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Becker writes, &quot;Suicidal adolescent visitors risk losing their doubts and fears about committing suicide. Risk factors include peer pressure to commit suicide and appointments for joint suicides. Furthermore, some chat rooms celebrate chatters who committed suicide.&quot;<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>Because suicide was a crime in various countries, including in England and Wales until 1961, the word 'commit' has traditionally been used in reference to it. Organisations such as the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> and the <a href="Samaritans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samaritans</a> have stopped using this word because of its negative connotation. 'Attempt' suicide or other phrases are preferred.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="in-other-species">In other species</h2>
<p>&quot;Suicide&quot; has been observed in <a href="salmonella" class="uri" title="wikilink">salmonella</a> seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> response against them.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Suicidal defences by workers are also noted in a Brazilian ant <em>Forelius pusillus</em> where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
