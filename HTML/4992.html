<p>The circumstances surrounding the <strong><a href="assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">assassination of John F. Kennedy</a></strong> on November 22, 1963, spawned suspicions of a conspiracy. These suspicions were mitigated somewhat when an official investigation by the <a href="Warren_Commission" title="wikilink">Warren Commission</a> concluded the following year that there was no conspiracy. Since then, doubts have arisen regarding the Commission's finding that <a href="Lee_Harvey_Oswald" title="wikilink">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy, and most Americans today believe that others besides Oswald were also involved in the assassination.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Critics have argued that the Commission and the government have covered up crucial information pointing to a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Subsequent official investigations confirmed most of the conclusions of the Warren Commission. However, the <a href="United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations" title="wikilink">United States House Select Committee on Assassinations</a> (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, with &quot;...a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> No person or organization was identified by the HSCA as being a co-conspirator of Oswald.

<p>Immediately after the shooting, many people suspected that the assassination was part of a larger plot.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Ruby's shooting of Oswald compounded initial suspicions.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Among conspiracy theorists, <a href="Mark_Lane_(author)" title="wikilink">Mark Lane</a> has been described as writing &quot;the first literary shot&quot; with his article, &quot;Defense Brief for Oswald,&quot; in the December 19, 1963 edition of the <em><a href="Guardian_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Guardian</a></em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Thomas Buchanan's <em>Who Killed Kennedy?</em>, published in May 1964, has been credited as the first book alleging a conspiracy.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1964, the <a href="Warren_Commission" title="wikilink">Warren Commission</a> concluded that Oswald acted alone and that no credible evidence supported the contention that he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the president.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Commission also indicated that <a href="Dean_Rusk" title="wikilink">Dean Rusk</a>, the Secretary of State; <a href="Robert_S._McNamara" title="wikilink">Robert S.

<p>In 1979, the <a href="United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations" title="wikilink">United States House Select Committee on Assassinations</a> (HSCA) agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but concluded that the Commission's report and the original FBI investigation were seriously flawed. The HSCA concluded that at least four shots were fired with a &quot;high probability&quot; that two gunmen fired at the President, and that a conspiracy was probable.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The HSCA stated that &quot;the Warren Commission failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="John_F._Kennedy_assassination#Ramsey_Clark_Panel" title="wikilink">Ramsey Clark Panel</a> and the <a href="John_F._Kennedy_assassination#Rockefeller_Commission" title="wikilink">Rockefeller Commission</a> both supported the Warren Commission's conclusions, while <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> District Attorney <a href="Jim_Garrison" title="wikilink">Jim Garrison</a> <a href="Trial_of_Clay_Shaw" title="wikilink">unsuccessfully prosecuted</a> <a href="Clay_Shaw" title="wikilink">Clay Shaw</a> for conspiring to assassinate Kennedy.</p>
<h3 id="public-opinion">Public opinion</h3>
<p>According to <a href="John_C._McAdams" title="wikilink">John McAdams</a>: &lt;U+201C&gt;The greatest and grandest of all conspiracy theories is the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Others have frequently referred to it as &quot;the mother of all conspiracies&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The number of books written about the assassination of Kennedy has been estimated to be in the range of 1,000 to 2,000.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> According to <a href="Vincent_Bugliosi" title="wikilink">Vincent Bugliosi</a>, 95% of those books are &quot;pro-conspiracy and anti-Warren Commission&quot;.</p>
<p>Kennedy assassination enthusiasts have been described as belonging to &quot;<a href="conspiracy_theorists" title="wikilink">conspiracy theorists</a>&quot; on one side and &quot;<a href="debunkers" class="uri" title="wikilink">debunkers</a>&quot; on the other.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The great amount of controversy surrounding the event has led to bitter disputes between those who support the conclusion of the Warren Commission and those who reject it or are critical of the official explanation with each side leveling toward the other accusations of &quot;naivete, cynicism, and selective interpretation of the evidence&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Public opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. However, on the question of a government cover-up, different polls show both a minority and majority of Americans who believe the government engaged in one.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> These same polls also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved. A 2003 <a href="The_Gallup_Organization" title="wikilink">Gallup</a> poll reported that 75% of Americans do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> That same year an ABC News poll found that 70% of respondents suspected that the assassination involved more than one person.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> A 2004 <a href="Fox_News_Channel" title="wikilink">Fox News</a> poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy while 74% thought there had been a cover-up.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> As recently as 2009, some 76% of people polled for CBS News said they believed the President had been killed as the result of a conspiracy.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A Gallup Poll released November 15, 2013, approaching the 50th anniversary, still found only 30% of the population believe Oswald acted alone, and continued the run of 50 consecutive years of those believing that Oswald doing it by himself, never reaching a majority.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

On the <a href="CBS_News" title="wikilink">CBS News</a> program <em><a href="Face_the_Nation" title="wikilink">Face the Nation</a></em>, Schweiker also said: &quot;I think the [Warren] report, to those who have studied it closely, has collapsed like a house of cards ... the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was to not use its own investigators, but instead to rely on the CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence officials who directed the cover-up.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="James_H._Fetzer" title="wikilink">James H. Fetzer</a> took issue with a 1998 statement from Federal Judge John R.

Fetzer identified 16 &quot;smoking guns&quot; which he claims prove the official narrative is impossible, and therefore a conspiracy and cover-up occurred. He claims that evidence released by the ARRB substantiates these concerns. These include problems with bullet trajectories, the murder weapon, the ammunition used, inconsistencies between the Warren Commission's account and the autopsy findings, inconsistencies between the autopsy findings and what was reported by witnesses at the scene of the murder, eyewitness accounts that conflict with x-rays taken of the President's body, indications that the diagrams and photos of the President's brain in the <a href="National_Archives_and_Records_Administration" title="wikilink">National Archives</a> are not the President's, testimony by those who took and processed the autopsy photos that the photos were altered, created, or destroyed, indications that the <a href="Zapruder_film" title="wikilink">Zapruder film</a> had been tampered with, allegations that the Warren Commission's version of events conflicts with news reports from the scene of the murder, an alleged change to the motorcade route which facilitated the assassination, an alleged lax Secret Service and local law enforcement security, and statements by people who claim that they had knowledge of, or participated in, a conspiracy to kill the President.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Richard Buyer wrote that many witnesses whose statements pointed to a conspiracy were either ignored or <a href="witness_intimidation" title="wikilink">intimidated</a> by the Warren Commission.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In <em>JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness</em>, a 1992 biography of <a href="Jean_Hill" title="wikilink">Jean Hill</a>, Bill Sloan wrote that <a href="Arlen_Specter" title="wikilink">Arlen Specter</a>, assistant counsel for the Warren Commission, attempted to humiliate, discredit, and intimidate Jean Hill into changing her story. Jean Hill also told Sloan that she was abused by Secret Service agents, harassed by the FBI, and was the recipient of death threats.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>A later book by Sloan, <em>JFK: Breaking the Silence</em>, quotes several assassination eyewitnesses as saying that Warren Commission interviewers repeatedly cut short or stifled any comments casting doubt on the conclusion that Oswald acted alone. An updated version of Sloan's book, retitled <em>The Kennedy Conspiracy: 12 Startling Revelations About the JFK Assassination</em>, was published as an e-book in 2012. It includes the only comprehensive interview ever conducted with the late Ed Hoffman, a deaf-mute eyewitness. Through a sign-language interpreter, Hoffman tells of seeing gunmen behind the wooden fence in Dealey Plaza as Kennedy's motorcade passed by.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Crossfire</em>, <a href="Jim_Marrs" title="wikilink">Jim Marrs</a> gave accounts of several people who said they were intimidated by FBI agents, or intimidated by anonymous individuals, into altering or suppressing what they knew about the assassination, including Richard Carr, Acquilla Clemmons, Sandy Speaker, and A.

<p>The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated another alleged &quot;mysterious death&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;that of <a href="Rose_Cheramie" title="wikilink">Rose Cheramie</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Committee reported that Louisiana State Police Lieutenant <a href="Francis_Fruge" title="wikilink">Francis Fruge</a> traveled to <a href="Eunice,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Eunice, Louisiana</a> on November 20, 1963&lt;U+2014&gt;two days before the assassination&lt;U+2014&gt;to pick up Rose Cheramie, who had sustained minor injuries after she was hit by a car. Fruge drove Cheramie to the hospital and said that on the way there, she &quot;...related to [him] that she was coming from Florida to Dallas with two men who were Italians or resembled Italians.&quot; Fruge asked her what she planned to do in Dallas, to which she replied: &quot;...number one, pick up some money, pick up [my] baby, and ... kill Kennedy.&quot; Cheramie was admitted and treated at State Hospital in <a href="Jackson,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Jackson, Louisiana</a> for alcohol and heroin addiction. State Hospital physician, Dr. Victor Weiss later told a House Select Committee investigator that on November 25&lt;U+2014&gt;three days after the assassination&lt;U+2014&gt;one of his fellow physicians told him &quot;...that the patient, Rose Cheramie, stated before the assassination that President Kennedy was going to be killed.&quot; Dr. Weiss further reported that Cheramie told him after the assassination that she had worked for Jack Ruby and that her knowledge of the assassination originated from &quot;word in the underworld.&quot; After the assassination, Lt. Fruge contacted Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz regarding what he had learned from Cheramie, but Captain Fritz told him he &quot;wasn't interested&quot;. Cheramie was found dead by a highway near <a href="Big_Sandy,_Texas" title="wikilink">Big Sandy, Texas</a> on September 4, 1965; she had been run over by a car.</p>
<p>Another &quot;suspicious death&quot; cited by Jim Marrs was that of Joseph Milteer, director of the Dixie <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Klan</a> of Georgia. Milteer was secretly tape-recorded thirteen days before the assassination telling Miami police informant William Somersett that the murder of Kennedy was &quot;in the working.&quot; Milteer died in 1974 when a heater exploded in his house.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported in 1979 that Milteer's information on the threat to the President &quot;was furnished [to] the agents making the advance arrangements before the visit of the President&quot; to Miami, but that &quot;the Milteer threat was ignored by Secret Service personnel in planning the trip to Dallas.&quot; Robert Bouck, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Secret Service's Protective Research Section, &quot;...testified to the committee that threat information was transmitted from one region of the country to another if there was specific evidence it was relevant to the receiving region.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated the allegation &quot;that a statistically improbable number of individuals with some direct or peripheral association with the Kennedy assassination died as a result of that assassination, thereby raising the specter of conspiracy&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The committee's chief of research testified: &quot;Our final conclusion on the issue is that the available evidence does not establish anything about the nature of these deaths which would indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct or peripheral, caused by the assassination of President Kennedy or by any aspect of the subsequent investigation.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Author <a href="Gerald_Posner" title="wikilink">Gerald Posner</a> points out that Marrs' list was taken from the group of about 10,000 people connected even in the most tenuous way to the assassination, one of the multiple official investigations, or the independent research of conspiracy theorists. He notes that it would be surprising if a hundred people out of ten thousand did not die in &quot;unnatural ways&quot; and points out over half of the people on Marrs' list did not in fact die mysteriously, but of natural causes, such as Secret Service agent <a href="Roy_Kellerman" title="wikilink">Roy Kellerman</a>, who died of heart failure at age 69 in 1984, long after the Kennedy assassination, but is on Marrs' list as someone whose cause of death is &quot;unknown&quot;. Posner also points out that many prominent witnesses and conspiracy researchers continue to live long lives and have not made it onto the mysterious death list.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="allegations-of-evidence-suppression-tampering-and-fabrication">Allegations of evidence suppression, tampering, and fabrication</h2>
<p>According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that the evidence against Oswald was planted, forged, or tampered with is a main argument among those who believe a conspiracy took place.</p>
<h3 id="suppression-of-evidence">Suppression of evidence</h3>
<h4 id="ignored-testimony">Ignored testimony</h4>
<p>Some assassination researchers assert that witness statements indicating a conspiracy were ignored by the Warren Commission. In 1967, Josiah Thompson stated that the Commission ignored the testimony of seven witnesses who saw gunsmoke in the area of the stockade fence on the grassy knoll, as well as an eighth witness who smelled gunpowder at the time of the assassination.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In 1989, Jim Marrs wrote that the Commission failed to ask for the testimony of witnesses on the triple overpass whose statements pointed to a shooter on the grassy knoll.</p>
<h4 id="confiscated-film-and-photographs">Confiscated film and photographs</h4>
<p>Other researchers reported that witnesses who captured the assassination in photographs or on film had their cameras and/or film confiscated by police or other authorities. Author Jim Marrs and documentary producer Nigel Turner presented the account of <a href="Gordon_Arnold" title="wikilink">Gordon Arnold</a> who said that his film of the motorcade was taken by two policemen shortly after the assassination.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Another witness, Beverly Oliver, came forward in 1970 and said she was the &quot;<a href="Babushka_Lady" title="wikilink">Babushka Lady</a>&quot; who is seen, in the <a href="Zapruder_film" title="wikilink">Zapruder film</a>, filming the motorcade. She said that after the assassination she was contacted at work by two men who she thought &quot;...were either FBI or Secret Service agents.&quot; According to Oliver, the men told her that they wanted to develop her film and would return it to her within ten days, but they never returned the film.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="withheld-documents">Withheld documents</h4>
<p>Richard Buyer and others have complained that many documents pertaining to the assassination have been withheld over the years, including documents from the Warren Commission investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation, and the Church Committee investigation.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> These documents at one time included the President's autopsy records. Some documents are still not scheduled for release until 2029.

<p>The existence of large numbers of secret documents related to the assassination, and the long period of secrecy, suggests to some the possibility of a cover-up.

<h4 id="murder-weapon">Murder weapon</h4>
<p>The Warren Commission found that the shots which killed Kennedy and wounded Connally were fired from <a href="John_F._Kennedy_assassination_rifle" title="wikilink">the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle owned by Oswald</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman both initially identified the rifle found in the Texas School Book Depository as a 7.65 <a href="Mauser" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauser</a>. Weitzman signed an affidavit the following day describing the weapon as a &quot;7.65 Mauser bolt action equipped with a 4/18 scope, a thick leather brownish-black sling on it&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig claimed that he saw &quot;7.65 Mauser&quot; stamped on the barrel of the weapon.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Dallas District Attorney <a href="Henry_Wade" title="wikilink">Henry Wade</a> told the press that the weapon found in the Book Depository was a 7.65 Mauser, and this was reported by the media.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> But investigators later identified the rifle as a 6.5 Italian Mannlicher Carcano.  According to Mark Lane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strongest element in the case against Lee Harvey Oswald was the Warren Commission's conclusion that his rifle had been found on the 6th floor of the Book Depository building. Yet Oswald never owned a 7.65 Mauser. When the FBI later reported that Oswald had purchased only a 6.5 Italian Mannlicher-Carcano, the weapon at police headquarters in Dallas miraculously changed its size, its make and its nationality. The Warren Commission concluded that a 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano, not a 7.65 German Mauser, had been discovered by the Dallas deputies.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Matrix for Assassination</em>, author Richard Gilbride suggested that both weapons were involved and that Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz and Lieutenant J. Carl Day might have been conspirators.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Addressing &quot;speculation and rumors&quot;, the Warren Commission identified Weitzman as &quot;the original source of the speculation that the rifle was a Mauser&quot; and stated that &quot;[p]olice laboratory technicians subsequently arrived and correctly identified the weapon as a 6.5 Italian rifle.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="bullets-and-cartridges">Bullets and cartridges</h4>
<p>The Warren Commission determined that three bullets were fired at Kennedy. One of the three bullets missed the vehicle entirely; another bullet hit Kennedy, passed through his body and then struck Governor John Connally; and the third bullet was the fatal head shot to the President. Some claim that the bullet that passed through President Kennedy&lt;U+2019&gt;s body before striking Governor Connally&lt;U+2014&gt;dubbed by critics of the Commission as the &quot;magic bullet&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;was missing too little mass to account for the total weight of bullet fragments later found by the doctors who operated on Connally. Those making this claim included Connally&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief surgeon, Dr. Robert Shaw,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> as well as two of the Kennedy autopsy surgeons, Commander James Humes,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and Lt. Colonel Pierre Finck.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> However, in the book <em>Six Seconds in Dallas</em>, author Josiah Thompson took issue with this claim. Thompson added up the weight of the bullet fragments listed in the doctor reports and concluded that their total weight &quot;could&quot; have been less than the mass missing from the bullet.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>With Connally's death in 1993, forensic pathologist Dr. <a href="Cyril_Wecht" title="wikilink">Cyril Wecht</a> and the <a href="Assassination_Archives_and_Research_Center" title="wikilink">Assassination Archives and Research Center</a> petitioned <a href="Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> <a href="Janet_Reno" title="wikilink">Janet Reno</a> to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally's body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission's <a href="single-bullet_theory" title="wikilink">single-bullet</a>, single-gunman conclusion. The <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Justice Department</a> replied that it &quot;...would have no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally's family gave [it] permission.&quot; Connally's family refused permission.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="allegations-of-multiple-gunmen">Allegations of multiple gunmen</h2>
<p><img src="Dealey_Plaza_2003.jpg" title="fig:Dealey Plaza in 2003." alt="Dealey Plaza in 2003." /> The Warren Commission concluded that &quot;three shots were fired [from the Texas School Book Depository] in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Some assassination researchers, including Anthony Summers, dispute the Commission's findings. They point to evidence that brings into question the number of shots fired, the origin of the shots, and the ability of Oswald to accurately fire three shots in a short amount of time. These researchers suggest the involvement of multiple gunmen.</p>
<p>Governor Connally, seated in the limousine's jump seat directly in front of Kennedy, testified before the Warren Commission that &quot;...the thought immediately passed through my mind that there were either two or three people involved, or more, in this&lt;U+2014&gt;or someone was shooting with an automatic rifle.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="number-of-shots">Number of shots</h3>
<p>Based on the &quot;consensus among the witnesses at the scene&quot; and &quot;in particular the three spent cartridges&quot;, the Warren Commission determined that &quot;the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots were fired&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded there were four shots, one coming from the direction of the grassy knoll.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The Warren Commission, and later the House Select Committee on Assassinations, concluded that one of the shots hit President Kennedy in &quot;the back of his neck&quot;, exited his throat, continued on to strike Governor Connally in the back, exited Connally's chest, shattered his right wrist, and embedded itself in his left thigh.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> This conclusion came to be known as the &quot;<a href="single_bullet_theory" title="wikilink">single bullet theory</a>&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="origin-of-the-shots">Origin of the shots</h3>
<p><img src="JFK_Wooden_Fence.jpg" title="fig:The wooden fence on the grassy knoll." alt="The wooden fence on the grassy knoll." /> The Warren Commission concluded that all of the shots fired at President Kennedy originated from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository. The Commission based its conclusion on the &quot;cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic experts and medical authorities,&quot; including onsite testing, as well as analysis of films and photographs conducted by the FBI and Secret Service.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations agreed to publish a report from Warren Commission critic <a href="Robert_Groden" title="wikilink">Robert Groden</a>, in which he named &quot;nearly [two] dozen suspected firing points in Dealey Plaza&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> These sites included multiple locations in or on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository, the Dal-Tex Building, and the Dallas County Records Building, as well as the railroad overpass, a storm drain located along the north curb of Elm street, and various spots near the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Josiah Thompson concluded that the shots fired on the motorcade came from three locations: the Texas School Book Depository, the area of the grassy knoll, and the Dal-Tex Building.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="testimony-of-eyewitnesses">Testimony of eyewitnesses</h4>
<p>According to some assassination researchers, the grassy knoll was identified by the majority of witnesses as the area from where shots were fired.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In March 1965, Harold Feldman wrote that there were 121 witnesses to the assassination with 51 indicating that the shots that killed Kennedy came from the area of the grassy knoll.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> In 1967, Josiah Thompson examined the statements of 64 witnesses and found that 33 of them thought that the shots emanated from the grassy knoll.</p>
<p>In 1966, <em><a href="Esquire_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Esquire</a></em> magazine credited Feldman with &quot;advanc[ing] the theory that there were two assassins: one on the grassy knoll and one in the Book Depository.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Jim Marrs also wrote that the weight of evidence suggested shots came from both the grassy knoll and the Texas School Book Depository.</p>
<p><a href="Lee_Bowers" title="wikilink">Lee Bowers</a> operated a railroad tower that overlooked the parking lot on the north side of the grassy knoll. He reported that he saw two men behind the picket fence at the top of the grassy knoll before the shooting. The men did not appear to be acting together and did not appear to be doing anything suspicious. After the shooting, Bowers said that one of the men remained behind the fence. Bowers said that he lost track of the second man whose clothing blended into the foliage. When interviewed by Mark Lane, Bowers noted that he saw something that attracted his attention, either a flash of light, or maybe smoke, from the knoll, leading him to believe &quot;something out of the ordinary&quot; had occurred there. Bowers told Lane he heard three shots, the last two in quick succession. Bowers opined that they could not have come from the same rifle.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>William and Gayle Newman were standing at the curb on the north side of Elm St. with their two children. Mr. Newman said that the shot to Kennedy's head was fired from behind him (from the knoll).</p>
<p>Jesse Price was the building engineer for the Terminal Annex Building, located across from the Texas School Book Depository on the opposite side of Dealey Plaza. Price viewed the presidential motorcade from the Terminal Annex Building's roof. In an interview with Mark Lane, Price said that he believed the shots came from &quot;just behind the picket fence where it joins the underpass.&quot; He claimed to have seen a &quot;...man run towards the passenger cars on the railroad siding after the volley of shots.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>Some assassination researchers claim that FBI photographs of the presidential limousine show a bullet hole in its windshield above the rear-view mirror, and a crack in the windshield itself. When Robert Groden, author of <em>The Killing of a President</em>, asked for an explanation, the FBI responded that what Groden thought was a bullet hole &quot;occurred prior to Dallas&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> A researcher later found a Ford Motor employee who had helped build a new windshield for the car, who said he and his co-workers had been told to destroy the old windshield, which had a bullet hole from the front.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="film-and-photographic-evidence">Film and photographic evidence</h4>
<p>Film and photographic evidence of the assassination have led viewers to different conclusions regarding the origin of the shots. In the Zapruder film, the President's head and upper torso move backwards after the last, fatal shot&lt;U+2014&gt;an indication that the bullet was fired from the front. However, close inspection of frames 312 and 313 show Kennedy's head moving forward by as much as 1.9  inches, before his head moves backwards.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Some, including <a href="Robert_Groden" title="wikilink">Robert Groden</a> and <a href="Cyril_Wecht" title="wikilink">Cyril Wecht</a>, state that the film is evidence of a &quot;double hit&quot; to Kennedy's head.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Wecht believes that the film depicts the President's head being &quot;struck twice in a synchronized fashion, from the rear and the right front side.&quot; A further theory says that it was the braking of the car by the driver <a href="William_Greer" title="wikilink">William Greer</a> which caused Kennedy's head to move forward as a frontal shot was fired. Paul Chambers argues that Frame Z313 shows multiple jets of blood, bone and brain matter exiting just above Kennedy's right ear and claims this is consistent with a high velocity (approx. 4,000 ft/sec) rifle rather than the medium velocity (2,000 ft/sec) Mannlicher-Carcano.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Chambers also claims that analysis of the Zapruder film at normal speed shows the President's limousine comes to a complete stop moments before the final fatal head shot.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="acoustical-evidence">Acoustical evidence</h4>
<p>According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a <a href="Dictabelt_evidence_relating_to_the_assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Dictabelt recording of the Dallas Police Department radio dispatch transmissions from November 22, 1963</a> was analyzed to &quot;resolve questions concerning the number, timing, and origin of the shots fired in Dealey Plaza&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The Committee concluded that the source of the recording was from an open microphone on the motorcycle of H.B. McLain escorting the motorcade and that &quot;the scientific acoustical evidence established a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy.&quot;</p>
<p>The acoustical analysis firm hired by the Committee recommended that the Committee conduct an acoustical reconstruction of the assassination in Dealey Plaza to determine if any of the six impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were fired from the Texas School Book Depository or the grassy knoll. The reconstruction would entail firing from two locations in Dealey Plaza&lt;U+2014&gt;the depository and the knoll&lt;U+2014&gt;at particular target locations and recording the sounds through numerous microphones. The purpose was to determine if the sequences of impulses recorded during the reconstruction would match any of those on the dispatch tape. If so, it would be possible to determine if the impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were caused by shots fired during the assassination from shooter locations in the depository and on the knoll.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1978, at the behest of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, members of the Dallas Police Pistol Team participated in an acoustical reconstruction by firing both rifles and pistols from the locations selected by the researchers. During the acoustical reconstruction, the Dallas Police marksmen had no difficulty hitting the targets. The House Select Committee's firearms experts &quot;...testified that given the distance and angle from the sixth floor window to the location of the President's limousine, it would have been easier to use the open iron sights.&quot; The Warren Commission tests had been carried out on the assumption that Oswald, who they and the Committee concluded fired the shots, used the telescopic sight.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>An article which appeared in <em><a href="Science_&amp;_Justice" title="wikilink">Science &amp; Justice</a></em>, a quarterly publication of Britain's Forensic Science Society, found there was a 96% certainty, based on analysis of audio recordings made during the assassination, that a shot was fired from &quot;the grassy knoll&quot; in front of and to the right of the President's limousine.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

<p>Some critics skeptical of the official &quot;<a href="single_bullet_theory" title="wikilink">single bullet theory</a>&quot; state that the trajectory of the bullet, which hit Kennedy above the right shoulder blade and passed through his neck (according to the autopsy), would have had to change course to pass through Connally's rib cage and wrist.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Kennedy's death certificate, signed by his personal physician Dr. <a href="George_Burkley" title="wikilink">George Burkley</a>, locates the bullet at the third thoracic vertebra&lt;U+2014&gt;which some claim is too low to have exited his throat.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Moreover, the bullet was traveling downward, since the shooter was in a sixth floor window.

<p>There is conflicting testimony about the autopsy performed on Kennedy's body, particularly as to when the examination of his brain took place, who was present, and whether or not the photos submitted as evidence are the same as those taken during the examination.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Douglas Horne, the Assassination Record Review Board's chief analyst for military records, said he was &quot;90 to 95% certain&quot; that the photographs in the <a href="National_Archives_and_Records_Administration" title="wikilink">National Archives</a> are not of President Kennedy's brain. Supporting Horne was Dr. Gary Aguilar who stated: &quot;According to Horne&lt;U+2019&gt;s findings, the second brain&lt;U+2014&gt;which showed an exit wound in the front&lt;U+2014&gt;allegedly replaced Kennedy's real brain&lt;U+2014&gt;which revealed much greater damage to the rear, consistent with an exit wound and thus evidence of a shot from the front.&quot;<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="oswalds-marksmanship">Oswald's marksmanship</h3>
<p>The Warren Commission examined the capabilities of the Carcano rifle and ammunition, as well as Oswald's military training and post-military experience, and determined that Oswald had the ability to fire three shots within a time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> According to their report, an army specialist using Oswald's rifle was able to duplicate the feat and even improved on the time.

Also contained in the Commission report is testimony by <a href="Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Marine Corps</a> Major Eugene Anderson confirming that Oswald's military records show that he qualified as &quot;<a href="sharpshooter" class="uri" title="wikilink">sharpshooter</a>&quot; in 1956. But this is confronted with more detailed record of his shooting abilities. According to official Marine Corps records Oswald was tested in shooting, scoring 212 in December 1956 (slightly above the minimum for qualification as a sharpshooter - the intermediate category), but in May 1959 scoring only 191 (barely earning the lower designation of marksman - the lowest category of skilled shooter, but still above undesignated shooters). He never approached the highest marksmanship category in the Marine Corps - the Expert. Conspiracy theorists such as Walt Brown and authors such as <a href="Richard_H._Popkin" title="wikilink">Richard H. Popkin</a> contend that Oswald was a notoriously poor shot, his rifle was inaccurate, and that no one has ever been able to duplicate his ability to fire three shots within the time frame given by the Warren Commission.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> FBI marksman Robert Frazier who tested the rifle in two sets of tests testified to the Warren Commission that he could not reach the 5.6 second mark for firing three shots and all his shots fired five inches high and five inches to the right due to an uncorrectable deficiency in the telescopic sight.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p>Assassination researchers differ as to the role of Oswald in the assassination of President Kennedy. Many believe that Oswald was an uninvolved patsy, while others believe he was actively involved in a plot. Oswald's ability to move to Russia, then return as an avowed communist to the United States with help from the State Department &lt;U+2013&gt; who gave him a repatriation loan of $435.71<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; has led theorists to speculate that he was working for the CIA and/or the FBI.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>Oswald contacted the FBI twice in 1963. The first occasion was on August 9 when Oswald was arrested in New Orleans for disturbing the peace. After his arrest, Oswald asked to speak with an FBI agent. Agent John Quigley arrived and spent over an hour talking to Oswald.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Also, Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office in November 1963, about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, and attempted to deliver a note to Special Agent <a href="James_Hosty" title="wikilink">James Hosty</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>New Orleans D.A.

And then when the time came, they took the scapegoat&lt;U+2014&gt;the man who thought he was working for the United States government&lt;U+2014&gt;and killed him real quick. And then the machinery, <a href="disinformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">disinformation</a> machinery, started turning and they started making a villain out of a man who genuinely was probably a hero.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>James Botelho, a former roommate of Oswald who would later become a California judge, stated in an interview with Mark Lane, &quot;Oswald, it was said, was the only Marine ever to defect from his country to another country, a Communist country, during peacetime.... When the Marine Corps and American intelligence decided not to probe the reasons for the 'defection', I knew then what I know now: Oswald was on an assignment in Russia for American intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald &quot;...killed Dallas Police Officer <a href="J._D._Tippit" title="wikilink">J. D. Tippit</a> in an apparent attempt to escape.&quot; The evidence that formed the basis for this conclusion was: &quot;(1) two eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald's possession at the time of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald's jacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.&quot;</p>
<p>Some researchers have alleged that the murder of Officer Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Jim Marrs hypothesized that &quot;the slaying of Officer J. D. Tippit may have played some part in [a] scheme to have Oswald killed, perhaps to eliminate co-conspirator Tippit or simply to anger Dallas police and cause itchy trigger fingers.&quot; Researcher James Douglass said that &quot;...the killing of [Tippit] helped motivate the Dallas police to kill an armed Oswald in the Texas Theater, which would have disposed of the scapegoat before he could protest his being framed.&quot; Harold Weisberg offered a simpler explanation: &quot;Immediately, the [flimsy] police case [against Oswald] required a willingness to believe. This was proved by affixing to Oswald the opprobrious epithet of 'cop-killer.'&quot; <a href="Jim_Garrison" title="wikilink">Jim Garrison</a> alleged that evidence was altered to frame Oswald, stating: &quot;If Oswald was innocent of the Tippit murder the foundation of the government's case against him collapsed.&quot;<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p>Some critics doubt that Tippit was killed by Oswald and assert he was shot by other conspirators.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> They allege discrepancies in witness testimony and physical evidence which they feel call into question the Commission's conclusions regarding the murder of Tippit. According to Jim Marrs, Oswald's guilt in the assassination of Kennedy is placed in question by the presence of &quot;a growing body of evidence to suggest that [he] did not kill Tippit&quot;. Others say that multiple men were directly involved in Tippit's killing. Conspiracy researcher <a href="Kenn_Thomas" title="wikilink">Kenn Thomas</a> has alleged that the Warren Commission omitted testimony and evidence that two men shot Tippit and that one left the scene in a car.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>William Alexander&lt;U+2014&gt;the Dallas assistant district attorney who recommended that Oswald be charged with the Kennedy and Tippit murders&lt;U+2014&gt;later became skeptical of the Warren Commission's version of the Tippit murder. He stated that the Commission's conclusions on Oswald's movements &quot;don't add up,&quot; and that &quot;certainly [Oswald] may have had accomplices.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a href="Brian_McKenna" title="wikilink">Brian McKenna</a>'s review of Henry Hurt's book, <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, Hurt reported that &quot;Tippit may have been killed because he impregnated the wife of another man&quot; and that Dallas police officers lied and altered evidence to set up Oswald to save Tippit's reputation.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="allegations-regarding-witness-testimony-and-physical-evidence">Allegations regarding witness testimony and physical evidence</h4>
<p>The Warren Commission identified Helen Markham and Domingo Benavides as two witnesses who actually saw the shooting. Conspiracy theorist <a href="Richard_Belzer" title="wikilink">Richard Belzer</a> criticized the Commission for, in his description, &quot;relying&quot; on the testimony of Markham whom he described as &quot;imaginative&quot;.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Jim Marrs also took issue with Markham's testimony, stating that her &quot;credibility ... was strained to the breaking point&quot;. Joseph Ball, senior counsel to the Commission, referred to Markham's testimony as &quot;full of mistakes,&quot; characterizing her as an &quot;utter screwball.&quot; The Warren Commission addressed concerns regarding Markham's reliability as a witness and concluded: &quot;However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit.&quot;</p>
<p>Domingo Benavides initially said that he did not think he could identify Tippit's assailant and was never asked to view a police lineup,<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> even though he was the person closest to the killing. Benavides later testified that the killer resembled pictures he had seen of Oswald.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Other witnesses were taken to police lineups. However, critics have questioned these lineups in that they consisted of people who looked very different from Oswald.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, witnesses who did not appear before the Commission identified an assailant who was not Oswald. Acquilla Clemons saw two men near Tippit&lt;U+2019&gt;s car just before the shooting.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> After the shooting, she ran outside of her house and saw a man with a gun whom she described as &quot;kind of heavy.&quot; He waved to the second man, urging him to &quot;go on.&quot; Frank Wright emerged from his home and observed the scene seconds after the shooting. He described a man standing by Tippit&lt;U+2019&gt;s body who had on a long coat and who ran to a parked car and drove away.</p>
<p>Critics have questioned whether the cartridge cases recovered from the scene were the same as those that were subsequently entered into evidence. Two of the cases were recovered by witness Domingo Benavides and turned over to police officer J.M. Poe. Poe told the FBI that he marked the shells with his own initials, &quot;J.M.P.&quot; to identify them.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Sergeant Gerald Hill later testified to the Warren Commission that it was he who had ordered police officer Poe to mark the shells.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> However, Poe's initials were not found on the shells produced by the FBI six months later.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a>Testifying before the Warren Commission, Poe said that although he recalled marking the cases, he &quot;couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t swear to it.&quot;<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> The identification of the cases at the crime scene raises more questions. Sergeant Gerald Hill examined one of the shells and radioed the police dispatcher, saying: &quot;The shell at the scene indicates that the suspect is armed with an automatic .38 rather than a pistol.&quot;<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> However, Oswald was reportedly arrested carrying a <em>non</em>-automatic .38 Special revolver.</p>
<h4 id="allegations-regarding-timeline">Allegations regarding timeline</h4>
<p>The Warren Commission investigated Oswald's movements between the time of the assassination and the shooting of Tippit, to ascertain whether Oswald might have had an accomplice who helped him flee the Book Depository. The Commission concluded &quot;...through the testimony of seven witnesses [that] Oswald was always alone.&quot; According to their final report, Oswald was seen by his housekeeper leaving his rooming house shortly after 1:00 pm and had enough time to travel nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 km) to the scene where Tippit was killed at 1:16 pm.</p>
<p>Some Warren Commission critics believe that Oswald did not have enough time to get from his house to the scene where Tippit was killed. The Commission&lt;U+2019&gt;s own test and estimation of Oswald&lt;U+2019&gt;s walking speed demonstrated that one of the longer routes to the Tippit shooting scene took 17 minutes and 45 seconds to walk.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> No witness ever surfaced who saw Oswald walk from his rooming house to the murder scene.</p>
<p>Conspiracy researcher Robert Groden believes that Tippit's murder may have occurred earlier than the time given in the Warren Report.  He notes that the Commission established the time of the shooting as 1:16 pm from police tapes that logged Domingo Benavides' use of the radio in Tippit's car. However, Benavides testified that he did not approach the car until &quot;a few minutes&quot; after the shooting, because he was afraid that the gunman might return.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> He was assisted in using the radio by witness T.

<p>Witness Helen Markham initially told the FBI that the shooting occurred &quot;possibly around 1:30 pm,&quot;<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> but she later told the Warren Commission: &quot;I wouldn't be afraid to bet it wasn't 6 or 7 minutes after 1.&quot;<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> In an unpublished manuscript titled <em>When They Kill a President</em>, Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig stated that when he heard the news that Tippit had been shot, he noted that the time was 1:06 pm.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> However, in a later statement to the press, Craig seemed confused about the time of the shooting.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>Warren &quot;Butch&quot; Burroughs, who ran the concession stand at the <a href="Texas_Theater" title="wikilink">Texas Theater</a> where Oswald was arrested, told author <a href="James_W._Douglass" title="wikilink">James Douglass</a> in 2007 that Oswald came into the theater between 1:00 and 1:07 pm, which if true would make Oswald's alleged 1:16 pm shooting of Officer J.

<p>Earlier, in the spring of 1963, Oswald had written to the <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> headquarters of the pro-Castro <a href="Fair_Play_for_Cuba_Committee" title="wikilink">Fair Play for Cuba Committee</a>, proposing to rent &quot;...a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans.&quot;<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> As the sole member of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswald ordered 1,000 leaflets with the heading, &quot;Hands Off Cuba&quot; from a local printer.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> On August 16, 1963, Oswald passed out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets in front of the <a href="International_Trade_Mart" title="wikilink">International Trade Mart</a> in New Orleans,<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>

Banister's office was involved in anti-Castro and private investigative activities in the New Orleans area.

<p>In the late-1970s, the <a href="House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations" title="wikilink">House Select Committee on Assassinations</a> (HSCA) investigated the possible relationship of Oswald to Banister's office. While the committee was unable to interview <a href="Guy_Banister" title="wikilink">Guy Banister</a> (who died in 1964), the committee did interview his brother Ross Banister. Ross &quot;...told the committee that his brother had mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba literature on one occasion.

<p>Guy Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, would later tell author <a href="Anthony_Summers" title="wikilink">Anthony Summers</a> that she saw Oswald at Banister's office, and that he filled out one of Banister's &quot;agent&quot; application forms.

<p>In 1966, New Orleans <a href="District_Attorney" title="wikilink">District Attorney</a> <a href="Jim_Garrison" title="wikilink">Jim Garrison</a> began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

<p>Gaeton Fonzi, an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, wrote that investigators were pressured not to look into the relationship between <a href="Lee_Harvey_Oswald" title="wikilink">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> and the CIA.

<p>Some argue that the lack of Secret Service protection occurred because Kennedy himself had asked that the Secret Service make itself discreet during the Dallas visit. However, Vince Palamara, who interviewed several Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, disputes this. Palamara reports that Secret Service driver Sam Kinney told him that requests&lt;U+2014&gt;such as removing the bubble top from the limousine in Dallas, not having agents positioned beside the limousine's rear bumper, and reducing the number of Dallas police motorcycle outriders near the limousine's rear bumper&lt;U+2014&gt;were not made by Kennedy.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a><a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a><a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a></p>

<p>The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote: &quot;The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved&quot;.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>
<p>With the 1959 <a href="Cuban_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cuban Revolution</a> that brought Fidel Castro to power, thousands of Cubans left their homeland to take up residence in the United States. Many exiles hoped to overthrow Castro and return to Cuba. Their hopes were dashed with the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, and many exiles blamed President Kennedy for the failure.</p>
<p>The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that some militant Cuban exiles might have participated in Kennedy's murder. These exiles worked closely with CIA operatives in violent activities against Castro's Cuba. In 1979, the committee reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Kennedy's popularity among the Cuban exiles had plunged deeply by 1963. Their bitterness is illustrated in a tape recording of a meeting of anti-Castro Cubans and right-wing Americans in the Dallas suburb of Farmer's Branch on October 1, 1963.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>

When Maheu contacted Roselli, Maheu hid the fact that he was sent by the CIA, instead portraying himself an advocate for international corporations. He offered to pay $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli declined any pay. Roselli introduced Maheu to two men he referred to as &quot;Sam Gold&quot; and &quot;Joe.&quot; &quot;Sam Gold&quot; was <a href="Sam_Giancana" title="wikilink">Sam Giancana</a>; &quot;Joe&quot; was <a href="Santo_Trafficante,_Jr." title="wikilink">Santo Trafficante, Jr.</a>, the Tampa, Florida boss and one of the most powerful mobsters in pre-revolution Cuba.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> Glenn Kessler of <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em> explained: &quot;After Fidel Castro led a revolution that toppled a friendly government in 1959, the CIA was desperate to eliminate him.

Many Cuban exiles and Mafia bosses disliked President Kennedy, blaming him for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. They also disliked his brother, the young and idealistic Attorney General <a href="Robert_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Robert Kennedy</a>, who had conducted an unprecedented legal assault on organized crime. This was especially provocative because several Mafia &quot;families&quot; had allegedly worked with JFK's father, <a href="Joseph_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Joseph Kennedy</a>, to get JFK elected. Both the Mafia and the anti-Castro Cubans were experts in assassination&lt;U+2014&gt;the Cubans having been trained by the CIA.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> Bonanno reported that he recognized the high degree of involvement of other Mafia families when Jack Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster <a href="Sam_Giancana" title="wikilink">Sam Giancana</a>.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a></p>
<p>Some conspiracy researchers have alleged a plot involving elements of the Mafia, the CIA and the anti-Castro Cubans, including Anthony Summers who stated: &quot;Sometimes people sort of glaze over about the notion that the Mafia and U.S. intelligence and the anti-Castro activists were involved together in the assassination of President Kennedy.

Anderson said that although he was never able to independently confirm Roselli's entire story, many of Roselli's details checked out. Anderson said that Oswald may have played a role in the assassination, but that more than one gunman was involved. Johnny Roselli, as previously noted, had worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.</p>
<p>The <a href="History_(U.S._TV_channel)" title="wikilink">History Channel</a> program, <em><a href="The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy" title="wikilink">The Men Who Killed Kennedy</a></em> presented additional evidence for organized crime involvement.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> Christian David was a <a href="Corsican_Mafia" title="wikilink">Corsican Mafia</a> member interviewed in prison.

According to David, there were three shooters. He provided the name of one&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Lucien_Sarti" title="wikilink">Lucien Sarti</a>. David said that since the other two shooters were still alive, it would break a code of conduct for him to identify them. When asked what the shooters were wearing, David noted their <em>modus operandi</em> was to dress in costumes such as official uniforms. Much of Christian David's testimony was confirmed by former Corsican member Michelle Nicole, who was part of the <a href="DEA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DEA</a> witness protection program.</p>
<p>The book <em>Ultimate Sacrifice</em>, by <a href="Lamar_Waldron" title="wikilink">Lamar Waldron</a> and <a href="Thom_Hartman" title="wikilink">Thom Hartman</a>, attempted to synthesize these theories with new evidence. The authors argued that government officials felt obliged to help the assassins cover up the truth because the assassination conspiracy had direct ties to American government plots to assassinate Castro. Outraged at <a href="Robert_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Robert Kennedy</a>'s attack on organized crime, mob leaders had President Kennedy killed to remove Robert from power. A government investigation of the plot was thwarted, the authors allege, because it would have revealed embarrassing evidence of American government involvement with organized crime in plots to kill Castro.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lyndon-b.-johnson-conspiracy">Lyndon B. Johnson conspiracy</h3>
<p>A 2003 Gallup poll indicated that nearly 20% of Americans suspected <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> of being involved in the assassination of Kennedy. Critics of the Warren Commission have accused Johnson of plotting the assassination because he hated the <a href="Kennedy_family" title="wikilink">Kennedys</a> and feared that he would be dropped from the Democratic ticket for the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1964" title="wikilink">1964 election.</a> With his 1968 book <em>The Dark Side of Lyndon Baines Johnson</em>, Joachim Joesten is credited as being the first conspiracy author to accuse Johnson of having a role in the assassination. According to Joesten, Johnson &quot;played the leading part&quot; in a conspiracy that involved &quot;the Dallas oligarchy and ... local branches of the CIA, the FBI, and the Secret Service&quot;. Other assassination authors who have indicated there was complicity on the part of Johnson include <a href="Jim_Marrs" title="wikilink">Jim Marrs</a>, Ralph D. Thomas, J. Gary Shaw, Larry Harris, Walt Brown, Noel Twyman, <a href="Barr_McClellan" title="wikilink">Barr McClellan</a>, Craig Zirbel, <a href="Penn_Jones,_Jr." title="wikilink">Penn Jones, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Madeleine_Brown" title="wikilink">Madeleine Brown</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, researcher Barr McClellan published the book, <em>Blood, Money &amp; Power</em>.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> McClellan claims that Johnson, motivated by the fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination with the help of his friend, <a href="Austin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austin</a> attorney <a href="Edward_A._Clark" title="wikilink">Edward A. Clark</a>. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate <a href="Malcolm_&quot;Mac&quot;_Wallace" title="wikilink">Malcolm &quot;Mac&quot; Wallace</a>, and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including <a href="Clint_Murchison,_Sr." title="wikilink">Clint Murchison</a> and <a href="H._L._Hunt" title="wikilink">H. L. Hunt</a>. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil depletion allowance to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over 100 million dollars to the American oil industry. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, <em><a href="The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy" title="wikilink">The Men Who Killed Kennedy</a></em>. The episode, entitled &quot;The Guilty Men&quot;, drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, President Johnson's former aides, and ex-Presidents <a href="Gerald_Ford" title="wikilink">Gerald Ford</a> and <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a> following its airing on <a href="History_(U.S._TV_channel)" title="wikilink">The History Channel</a>.

<p>Madeleine Brown, who alleged she was the mistress of Johnson, also implicated him in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. In 1997, Brown said that Johnson, along with H. L. Hunt, had begun planning Kennedy's demise as early as 1960. Brown claimed that by its fruition in 1963, the conspiracy involved dozens of persons, including the leadership of the FBI and the Mafia, as well as prominent politicians and journalists.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> In the documentary <em><a href="The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy" title="wikilink">The Men Who Killed Kennedy</a></em>, Madeleine Brown and May Newman (an employee of Texas oilman Clint Murchison) both placed J.

In the same documentary, several other Johnson associates also voiced their suspicions of Johnson.</p>
<p>Suspicions that Johnson was involved in covering-up facts about the assassination were supported by Parkland Hospital doctor <a href="Charles_Crenshaw" title="wikilink">Charles Crenshaw</a>. While treating Oswald, Crenshaw said he received a phone call from Johnson. Crenshaw gave his account of the phone conversation in his book <em>Trauma Room One</em>:</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Crenshaw: &quot;Mr. President, he's holding his own at the moment.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Johnson: &quot;Would you mind taking a message to the operating surgeon?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crenshaw: &quot;Dr. Shires is very busy right now, but I will convey your message.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Johnson: &quot;Dr. Crenshaw, I want a death-bed confession from the accused assassin. There's a man in the operating room who will take the statement. I will expect full cooperation in this matter.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crenshaw: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

In 2012, investigative biographer <a href="Robert_Caro" title="wikilink">Robert Caro</a> published his fourth volume on Johnson's career, <em>The Passage of Power</em>, which detailed Johnson's communications and actions as vice president, and described the events leading up to the assassination.<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> Caro wrote that &quot;nothing that I have found in my research&quot; points to involvement by Johnson.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a></p>

<p>The Warren Commission reported that they investigated &quot;dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban Government&quot; and that they found no evidence that Cuba was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: &quot;The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy&quot;.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a></p>
<p>Conspiracy theories frequently implicate <a href="Fidel_Castro" title="wikilink">Fidel Castro</a> as having ordered the assassination of Kennedy in retaliation for the CIA's previous attempts to assassinate him.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, <a href="Clare_Booth_Luce" title="wikilink">Clare Booth Luce</a>, wife of <a href="Time-Life" class="uri" title="wikilink">Time-Life</a> publisher <a href="Henry_Luce" title="wikilink">Henry Luce</a>, was one of a number of prominent Americans who sponsored anti-Castro groups. This support included funding exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba. In 1975, Clare Luce said that on the night of the assassination, she received a call from a member of a commando group she had sponsored. According to Luce, the caller's name was &quot;something like&quot; Julio Fernandez and he claimed he was calling her from New Orleans.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Luce, Fernandez told her that Oswald had approached his group with an offer to help assassinate Castro. Fernandez further claimed that he and his associates eventually found out that Oswald was a communist and supporter of Castro. He said that with this new-found knowledge, his group kept a close watch on Oswald until Oswald suddenly came into money and went to <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> and then Dallas.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a> Finally, according to Luce, Fernandez told her, &quot;There is a Cuban Communist assassination team at large and Oswald was their hired gun.&quot;</p>
<p>Luce said that she told the caller to give his information to the FBI. Subsequently, Luce would reveal the details of the incident to both the <a href="Church_Committee" title="wikilink">Church Committee</a> and the HSCA. Both committees investigated the incident, but were unable to uncover any evidence to corroborate the allegations.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1967, CIA Director <a href="Richard_Helms" title="wikilink">Richard Helms</a> told President Lyndon Johnson that the CIA had tried to assassinate Castro. Helms further stated that the CIA had employed members of the Mafia in this effort, and &quot;...that CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro dated back to August of 1960&lt;U+2014&gt;to the Eisenhower Administration.&quot; Helms also said that the plots against Castro continued into the Kennedy Administration and that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had known about both the plots and the Mafia's involvement.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>
<p>On separate occasions, Johnson told two prominent television newsmen that he believed that JFK's assassination had been organized by Castro as retaliation for the CIA's efforts to kill Castro. In October 1968, Johnson told veteran newsman <a href="Howard_K._Smith" title="wikilink">Howard K. Smith</a> of <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> that &quot;Kennedy was trying to get to Castro, but Castro got to him first.&quot; In September 1969, in an interview with <a href="Walter_Cronkite" title="wikilink">Walter Cronkite</a> of <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>, Johnson said that in regard to the assassination he could not &quot;honestly say that I've ever been completely relieved of the fact that there might have been international connections,&quot; and referenced unnamed &quot;others.&quot; Finally, in 1971, Johnson told his former speechwriter Leo Janos of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine that he &quot;never believed that Oswald acted alone&quot;.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1977, Castro was interviewed by newsman <a href="Bill_Moyers" title="wikilink">Bill Moyers</a>. Castro denied any involvement in Kennedy's death, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would have been absolute insanity by Cuba.... It would have been a provocation.

<p>President Lyndon Johnson also implicated the CIA in the assassination.

<p>The Warren Commission reported that they found no evidence that the Soviet Union was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.

<p>According to a 1966 FBI document, Colonel Boris Ivanov&lt;U+2014&gt;chief of the KGB at the time of the assassination&lt;U+2014&gt;stated that it was his personal opinion that the assassination had been planned by an organized group, rather than a lone individual.

<h3 id="decoy-hearse-and-wound-alteration">Decoy hearse and wound alteration</h3>
<p><a href="David_Lifton" title="wikilink">David Lifton</a> presented a scenario in which conspirators on <a href="Air_Force_One" title="wikilink">Air Force One</a> removed Kennedy's body from its original bronze casket and placed it in a shipping casket, while en route from Dallas to Washington. Once the presidential plane arrived at <a href="Andrews_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Andrews Air Force Base</a>, the shipping casket with the President's body in it was surreptitiously taken by helicopter from the side of the plane that was out of the television camera's view.

<p>Part of Lifton's theory comes from a House Select Committee on Assassinations report of an interview of Lt. Richard Lipsey on January 18, 1978 by committee staff members Donald Purdy and Mark Flanagan. According to the report, Lt. Richard Lipsey said that he and General Wehle had met President Kennedy's body at Andrews Air Force Base. Lipsey &quot;...placed [the casket] in a hearse to be transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Lipsey mentioned that he and Wehle then flew by helicopter to Bethesda and took [the body of] JFK into the back of Bethesda.&quot; Lipsey said that &quot;a decoy hearse had been driven to the front [of Bethesda].&quot;<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> With Lipsey's mention of a &quot;decoy hearse&quot; at Bethesda, Lifton theorized that the casket removed by Lipsey from Air Force One&lt;U+2014&gt;from the side of the plane exposed to television&lt;U+2014&gt;was probably also a decoy and was likely empty.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a><a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a></p>
<p>Laboratory technologist Paul O'Connor was one of the major witnesses supporting another part of David Lifton's theory that somewhere between Parkland and Bethesda the President's body was made to appear as if it had been shot only from the rear. O'Connor said that President Kennedy's body arrived at Bethesda inside a body bag in &quot;a cheap, shipping-type of casket&quot;, which differed from the description of the ornamental bronze casket and sheet that the body had been wrapped in at Parkland Hospital.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> O'Connor said that the brain had already been removed by the time it got to Bethesda,<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> and that there were &quot;just little pieces&quot; of brain matter left inside the skull.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a></p>
<p>Researcher <a href="David_Wrone" title="wikilink">David Wrone</a> dismissed the theory that Kennedy's body was surreptitiously removed from the presidential plane, stating that as is done with all cargo on airplanes for safety precautions, the coffin and lid were held by steel wrapping cables to prevent shifting during takeoff and landing and in case of air disturbances in flight.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> According to Wrone, the side of the plane away from the television camera &quot;was bathed in klieg lights, and thousands of persons watched along the fence that bent backward along that side, providing, in effect, a well-lit and very public stage for any would-be body snatchers&quot;.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="federal-reserve-conspiracy">Federal Reserve conspiracy</h3>
<p>Jim Marrs, in his book <em>Crossfire</em>, presented the theory that Kennedy was trying to rein in the power of the <a href="Federal_Reserve" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve</a>, and that forces opposed to such action might have played at least some part in the assassination.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a><a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> According to Marrs, the issuance of <a href="Executive_Order_11110" title="wikilink">Executive Order 11110</a> was an effort by Kennedy to transfer power from the Federal Reserve to the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">United States Department of the Treasury</a> by replacing <a href="Federal_Reserve_Notes" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve Notes</a> with <a href="Silver_Certificate" title="wikilink">Silver Certificates</a>.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a> Actor and author <a href="Richard_Belzer" title="wikilink">Richard Belzer</a> named the responsible parties in this theory as American &quot;billionaires, power brokers, and bankers ... working in tandem with the CIA and other sympathetic agents of the government.&quot;<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a></p>
<p>A 2010 article in <em><a href="Research_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Research</a></em> magazine discussing various controversies surrounding the Federal Reserve stated that &quot;the wildest accusation against the Fed is that it was involved in Kennedy's assassination.&quot;<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> Critics of the theory note that Kennedy called for and signed legislation phasing out Silver Certificates in favor of Federal Reserve Notes, thereby enhancing the power of the Federal Reserve; and that Executive Order 11110 was a technicality that only delegated existing presidential powers to the <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Treasury</a> for administrative convenience during a period of transition.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a><a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a></p>

<li><em>Appointment in Dallas</em> (1975) by Hugh McDonald suggests that Oswald was lured into a plot that he was told was a staged fake attempt to kill JFK to embarrass the Secret Service and to alert the government of the necessity for beefed-up Secret Service security. Oswald&lt;U+2019&gt;s role was to shoot at the motorcade but deliberately miss the target. The plotters then killed JFK themselves and framed Oswald for the crime. McDonald claims that, after being told the &quot;truth&quot; about JFK's death by CIA agent Herman Kimsey in 1964, he spent years trying to locate a man known as &lt;U+201C&gt;Saul.&lt;U+201D&gt; Saul was supposedly the unidentified man who was photographed exiting the Russian embassy in Mexico City in September 1963, whose photos were subsequently sent to the FBI in Dallas on the morning of November 22, 1963 (before the assassination), and mislabelled &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;. McDonald claims to have finally tracked Saul down in London in 1972 at which time Saul revealed the details of the plot to him.</li>

His conclusions were: (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife&lt;U+2019&gt;s professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations.
