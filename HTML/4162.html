<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Denise is married to <a href="LTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">LTC</a> Frank Sherwood and they have been married for 20 years. They have a son Jeremy. Jeremy in the first season was physically abusing his own mother and out of guilt joined the <a href="U.S._Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a>. Denise and Frank filed for divorce, because Denise had an affair with a patient, Mac, while Frank was away in Iraq. Frank found out about the affair through another soldier and was sent home to deal with his marital affairs. Frank also had reasons to be suspicious, because when Dr. Chris Ferlhingetti (Getti) was still alive, Denise and Getti got extremely close, and after Getti's motorcycle wreck while he was in the hospital, Frank saw Denise kissing his hand.</p>
<p>Frank and Denise have since abandoned the divorce and are currently trying to work things out.</p>
<p>In the Season 3 finale, after Jeremy witnessed the death of his friend in combat, the show ended with Denise and Frank returning home from Michael's promotion ceremony to hear a gunshot from inside the house, knowing Jeremy's the one inside. The fate of the Sherwoods is left unknown until the next season.</p>
<p>In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Jeremy did in fact set off the gun on purpose, but shot at his face in a mirror rather than shoot himself. He's taken to Mercer Army Medical Center and put on a 72-hour suicide watch and denied visits from Frank or Denise. <a href="Dr._Roland_Burton" title="wikilink">Roland Burton</a> takes Jeremy's case and becomes his counselor. Jeremy pretends to take his sedatives and hides them in his bed before having an emotional breakdown with Roland, wherein he admits to why he thinks he should die. Jeremy is currently seeking help and the premiere ended with him hugging his mother and father.</p>
<p>After Roxy has a <a href="miscarriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">miscarriage</a> in Season 4, Denise finds out she's pregnant (this is due to the actress <a href="Catherine_Bell" title="wikilink">Catherine Bell</a> becoming pregnant in real life). She tells Frank by giving him a box with a mobile in it when he's in bed. In &quot;Army Strong&quot;, Denise finds out that they are expecting a girl. She and Frank plan to name their daughter Molly. In the season finale, Denise gives birth to Molly.</p>
