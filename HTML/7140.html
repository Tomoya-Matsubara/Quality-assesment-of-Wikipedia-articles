He was drafted by his hometown Pirates in the first round of the <a href="2004_Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">2004 MLB Draft</a>.</p>

He graduated in 2004 as a star catcher on the baseball team and an outstanding wide receiver for the football team. Walker, who also played on the Rams' basketball team until his senior year, was a two-time <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> Male Athlete of the Year.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His baseball jersey, #24, was retired from Pine-Richland during a pre-game ceremony before the Pittsburgh Pirates' July 22, 2010 game.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Walker was signed by Pittsburgh Pirates' scout Jon Mercurio. After three minor league seasons,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Neil started 2007 rated No. 74 on <a href="Baseball_America" title="wikilink">Baseball America</a>'s list of Top 100 prospects, and No. 3 in the Pirates' organization behind <a href="Andrew_McCutchen" title="wikilink">Andrew McCutchen</a> and <a href="Brad_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Brad Lincoln</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Walker was invited to the Pirates' 2007 spring training as a non-roster invitee, where he was converted from his drafted position of <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a> to <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third base</a>. He was sent back to the Pirates Double-A affiliate <a href="Altoona_Curve" title="wikilink">Altoona Curve</a> where he spent the majority of the season. On May 15, 2007, he became the first Curve player to have a four-hit game, going 4-for-4 with a home run, double and two RBI against the <a href="Portland_Sea_Dogs" title="wikilink">Portland Sea Dogs</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Walker hit a pair of two-run home runs on May 27, 2007, helping the Curve end a 10-game losing streak against the <a href="Bowie_Baysox" title="wikilink">Bowie Baysox</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He hit a <a href="grand_slam_(baseball)" title="wikilink">grand slam</a> and drove in five runs on June 28, 2007 in the second game of a double-header against the <a href="Trenton_Thunder" title="wikilink">Trenton Thunder</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Walker was promoted to the Triple-A <a href="Indianapolis_Indians" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Indians</a> for the 2008 season, where he played 133 games, compiling a .242 average with 16 home runs, 80 RBI and 10 stolen bases.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="section">2009</h3>
<p>Walker spent the majority of the season again with the Pirates Triple-A affiliate <a href="Indianapolis_Indians" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Indians</a>. In 95 games, he hit .264 with 69 RBI and 5 stolen bases. He received his first Major League call-up on September 1, 2009 and served as a pinch-hitter for Pirates starter <a href="Charlie_Morton" title="wikilink">Charlie Morton</a> that night against the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>. His first career hit came five days later against <a href="Jason_Motte" title="wikilink">Jason Motte</a> of the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, a single to right field. He never became an every day regular player and finished the season hitting .194 in 17 games.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2010</h3>
<p>Walker spent most of <a href="spring_training" title="wikilink">spring training</a> with the Pirates in <a href="Bradenton,_Florida" title="wikilink">Bradenton, Florida</a> before being reassigned back to the Indians. He hit .321 with six home runs, 26 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 43 games with Indianapolis and on May 25, 2010, he was called back up to the Pirates when <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first baseman</a> <a href="Steve_Pearce_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Steve Pearce</a> was placed on the <a href="disabled_list" title="wikilink">disabled list</a> with a sprained ankle.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>He made his first Major League start of the year that night against the Cincinnati Reds, playing at <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third base</a>. He hit an RBI double in the 8th inning off Reds starter <a href="Mike_Leake" title="wikilink">Mike Leake</a>. But his role on the team was initially in question, as <a href="Andy_LaRoche" title="wikilink">Andy LaRoche</a> had been the Pirates every day third baseman. With high-priced free agent signing <a href="Akinori_Iwamura" title="wikilink">Akinori Iwamura</a> struggling, Pirates manager <a href="John_Russell_(catcher)" title="wikilink">John Russell</a> decided to give Walker a try at <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second base</a> - a position where he had only played 23 career games at any level.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>But the position change stuck and Walker quickly established himself as the new second baseman. He hit his first Major League home run on June 1, 2010 off <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> starter <a href="Ted_Lilly" title="wikilink">Ted Lilly</a>, a two-run shot that propelled the Pirates to a 3-2 victory. &quot;This goes back to being 5 or 6 years old at <a href="Three_Rivers_Stadium" title="wikilink">Three Rivers Stadium</a>, sitting in peanut heaven,&quot; Walker said after the game. &quot;Getting drafted by the Pirates, this is just a Cinderella story. It's incredible.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Walker missed hitting for the cycle by only a <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triple</a> on June 25, 2010 against the <a href="Oakland_Athletics" title="wikilink">Oakland Athletics</a>. He doubled and scored a run in the first inning, singled in the third and then hit his 3rd home run off Athletics starter <a href="Ben_Sheets" title="wikilink">Ben Sheets</a>. However, he was forced to leave the game after being nearly knocked unconscious by teammate <a href="Ryan_Church" title="wikilink">Ryan Church</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s knee when the two accidentally collided going for a fly ball.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He then missed the following seven games with concussion-like symptoms before returning to action on July 3.</p>
<p>Walker scored a career-high three times in a 12-6 win over the <a href="Houston_Astros" title="wikilink">Houston Astros</a> on July 17, 2010. He hit 3rd in the Pirates batting order, going 3-for-5 with 3 runs and 2 RBI. He set another career high three days later, recording five hits in one game against the <a href="Milwaukee_Brewers" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, finishing the night 5-for-5 with a run scored and an RBI. Walker became the first Pirate rookie since fellow Pittsburgh native <a href="John_Wehner" title="wikilink">John Wehner</a> in 1991 to have a five-hit game.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His hitting tear was finally ended on July 23, 2010 against the <a href="San_Diego_Padres" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a>, after recording six straight multi-hit games. He was batting .593 in that time (16-for-27) with four runs scored and eight RBIs.</p>
<p>Walker kicked off August with perhaps his best offensive performance in the big leagues. He had three hits and drove in a career-high four runs in a 7-6 win over the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> on August 3, 2010.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Walker played a pivotal role in a series win over the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, driving in three runs against <a href="Cy_Young_Award" title="wikilink">Cy Young</a> hopeful <a href="Adam_Wainwright" title="wikilink">Adam Wainwright</a> on August 24 and then repeating the feat the very next day against <a href="Jake_Westbrook" title="wikilink">Jake Westbrook</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Walker finished the 2010 season batting .296 with 12 home runs and 66 RBIs.</p>
<p>He was named the second baseman on <em>Baseball America</em>'s 2010 All-Rookie Team.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
