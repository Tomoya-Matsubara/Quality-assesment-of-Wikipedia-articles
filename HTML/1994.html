<p><strong>William Hickling Prescott</strong> (May 4, 1796 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 29, 1859) was an American historian and <a href="hispanist" class="uri" title="wikilink">hispanist</a>. He is widely recognized by <a href="historiography" title="wikilink">historiographers</a> to have been the first American scientific historian. Despite serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading normally, Prescott became one of the most eminent historians of the 19th century. He is also noted for his <a href="eidetic_memory" title="wikilink">eidetic memory</a>.</p>
<p>A direct descendent of the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">revolutionary</a> American officer <a href="William_Prescott" title="wikilink">William Prescott</a>, after growing up in <a href="Boston" title="wikilink">Boston, Massachusetts</a> Prescott attended <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>. His poor health prevented him from working professionally, and he therefore dedicated himself to a life of writing. After a few years as a freelance writer, he specialised in the study of late <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> Spain and the early <a href="Spanish_Empire" title="wikilink">Spanish Empire</a>. His works on the subject, <em>The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic</em> (1837), <em>The History of the Conquest of Mexico</em> (1843), <em>A History of the Conquest of Peru</em> (1847) and the unfinished <em>History of the Reign of Phillip II</em> (1856&lt;U+2013&gt;8) have become classic works in the field, and have had a great impact on the study of both Spain and <a href="Mesoamerica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesoamerica</a>. He has become the most widely translated American historian, and was the first writer to use <a href="citations" title="wikilink">bibliographical citations</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1821, Prescott abandoned the idea of a legal career because of his poor health and resolved to devote himself to literature.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Although he initially studied a very wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, <a href="History_of_North_America" title="wikilink">American history</a>, <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a> and <a href="political_philosophy" title="wikilink">political philosophy</a>, Prescott came to focus on <a href="Italian_poetry" title="wikilink">Italian poetry</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's <em><a href="La_Divina_Commedia" title="wikilink">La Divina Commedia</a></em> and Boccacio's <em><a href="Decameron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decameron</a></em>. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review&lt;U+2014&gt;both on the subject. The first of these, published in 1824,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> was titled <em>Italian Narrative Poetry</em>, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by <a href="Lorenzo_Da_Ponte" title="wikilink">Lorenzo Da Ponte</a>, the librettist of <a href="Mozart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozart</a>'s <a href="Don_Giovanni" title="wikilink">Don Giovanni</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the <em>North American Review</em> of July 1825.

<p>Prescott had a deep interest in aiding the blind and partially sighted.

He published an article in support of education for the blind in the <em>North American Review</em> of July 1830, and helped to raise $50,000 for the organisation in May 1833.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="History_of_Ferdinand_and_Isabella_1838_title_pages.jpg" title="fig:Title pages of 1838 edition" alt="Title pages of 1838 edition" width="300" /> His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion&lt;U+2014&gt;previously an agnostic, his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the Bible, the works of the theologian <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">William Paley</a> as well as more sceptical works such as <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">Hume's</a> <em>On Miracles</em>, he came to acknowledge the &quot;moral truth&quot; of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Despite this, and continued ill health, Prescott had gathered sufficient material to start drafting the <em>History</em> in October 1829.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> At around this time, Prescott read the works of <a href="Gabriel_Bonnot_de_Mably" title="wikilink">Gabriel Bonnot de Mably</a>, including his historiographical piece <em>De l&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tude de l&lt;U+2019&gt;histoire</em>. He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably's romantic ideal, and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He also encountered <em>Elogia de la R&lt;U+00E9&gt;ina Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Isabel</em>, by his Spanish contemporary <a href="Diego_Clemenc&lt;U+00ED&gt;n" title="wikilink">Diego Clemenc&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>, which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs' political roles. Due to further problems with his eyesight, it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the <em>History</em>. It was largely finished by 1834, but Prescott dedicated two years to <a href="abridgement" title="wikilink">abridging</a> and redrafting it. He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of <a href="Charles_Brockden_Brown" title="wikilink">Charles Brockden Brown</a> for <a href="Jared_Sparks" title="wikilink">Jared Sparks</a>' <em>Library of American Biography</em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> This work was largely based on other contemporary biographies of Brown, and did not become an authoritative work on the subject.

Despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work, he was at first unsure about publishing it. However, his father argued that refusing to publish it would amount to cowardice, and this swayed him.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first, and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a Colonel Aspinwall for consideration.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> However, both <a href="Longman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longman</a> and Murray, which were at the time the leading British publishers, refused the work, and Prescott decided to postpone.</p>

In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the <em>History of Ferdinand and Isabella</em>, Prescott started drafting the <em>History of the Conquest of Mexico</em> in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on <a href="Aztec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aztec</a> civilisation, and Prescott dismissed much of it as &quot;speculation&quot;, which meant he had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of <a href="Humboldt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Humboldt</a>).

<h3 id="research-on-philip-ii">Research on Philip II</h3>
<p>Shortly after the publication of the <em>Conquest of Peru</em>, Prescott turned his mind to writing a history of <a href="Philip_II_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Philip II of Spain</a>, which he had been contemplating for several years.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <a href="John_Lothrop_Motley" title="wikilink">John Lothrop Motley</a>, who planned to write an independent work on the subject, was aided by Prescott, who gave him access to his library.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Although the two corresponded, there seems to have been little collaboration on their respective works. Prescott had started searching for sources as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II. The principal archives of historical material were held in <a href="Simancas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Simancas</a>, but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the <em>Conquest of Mexico</em>) nor Middleton were able to gain access to them.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained.

<h3 id="final-works">Final works</h3>
<p>Prescott spent the winter in Boston, and returned to the composition of his work.

Compared to his previous works, the <em>History</em> received little coverage in the press or in academic journals. It was suggested to him that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of <a href="William_Robertson_(historian)" title="wikilink">William Robertson</a> on the subject to be definitive.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson's <em>The History of the reign of Charles V</em> in May 1855; it was published in December 1856.

Prescott himself was the origin of several now common elements of academic writing, including the use of <a href="citations" title="wikilink">bibliographical citations</a> and critical notes.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> As the work of an amateur historian, the <em>History of Ferdinand and Isabella</em> was an outstanding achievement, and it arguably was the best English-language work on the subject published until then.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The major problems with the work to the modern day historian are not related to the quality of the research or Prescott's understanding of the period, but rather that his focus is on the major political and military events as opposed to social and economic conditions. It has also been argued that Prescott partially subscribed to the <a href="Great_Man_theory" title="wikilink">Great Man theory</a>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The <em>Conquest of Mexico</em> has endured more than any other of Prescott's work: it is regarded as his greatest literary accomplishment.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> However, modern scholarship agrees that there are problems with Prescott's characterisation of the conquest. David Levin has argued that the Conquest shows &quot;inadequate attention to detail&quot; and remains a broad and general account of events.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In contrast to the <em>Conquest of Mexico</em>, the <em>Conquest of Peru</em> has received relatively little modern scholarly attention, perhaps due to some key similarities in style and structure.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> However, it is generally thought that the work was the authoritative account until the 20th century, and that Prescott used a broader range of source material than any previous writer on the subject.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> However, the <a href="archeological" class="uri" title="wikilink">archeological</a> and <a href="anthropology" title="wikilink">anthropological</a> aspects of both works have been heavily criticised by historians since the end of the 19th century. Prescott had never visited archeological sites in Mesoamerica and his understanding of <a href="Inca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inca</a> and <a href="Aztec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aztec</a> culture was weak.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In defence of Prescott, it has been argued that despite advances in archeological understanding, and a reconceptualization of the nature of pre-Columbian society, the works remain broadly historically accurate, and Prescott's elaborations on fact were due to a fundamental lack of source material.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> In contrast, <em>Phillip the Second</em> is considered essentially an inferior piece&lt;U+2014&gt;it lacks the epic structure and literary merits of Prescott's other work, and the work has not received more critical attention than other contemporary accounts of the monarch's life.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>There is a popular misconception that Prescott was completely blind, which seems to have stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to <em>The Conquest of Mexico</em>, in which he stated &quot;Nor have I ever corrected, or even read, my own original draft&quot;.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the <em>Conquest</em>, and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred&lt;U+2014&gt;Samuel Moreson, writing in a 1959 article for <a href="The_Atlantic_Monthly" title="wikilink">The Atlantic Monthly</a>, claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although there is no evidence to suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticise his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>Four biographies of Prescott have been written. In 1864, <a href="George_Ticknor" title="wikilink">George Ticknor</a> published a long personal memoir to his friend, which has become invaluable to later historians. Rollo Ogden wrote a biography in 1904, which essentially supplements Ticknor. <a href="Harry_Thurston_Peck" title="wikilink">Harry Thurston Peck</a>'s 1905 account is considered useful, but academically inferior.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> C. G. Gardiner's 1969 work is the definitive critical biography of Prescott, taking into account a wide range of unpublished documents that were unavailable to earlier biographers.</p>
<p>The town of <a href="Prescott,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Prescott</a> in Arizona was named in his honour, as was <a href="Headquarters_House_(Boston,_Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Headquarters House</a>.
