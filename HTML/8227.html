<p><strong>Drax Power Station</strong> is a large <a href="Fossil_fuel_power_plant" title="wikilink">coal-fired</a> <a href="power_station" title="wikilink">power station</a> in <a href="North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Yorkshire</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, capable of <a href="co-firing" class="uri" title="wikilink">co-firing</a> <a href="biomass" class="uri" title="wikilink">biomass</a> and <a href="petcoke" class="uri" title="wikilink">petcoke</a>. It is situated near the <a href="River_Ouse,_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">River Ouse</a> between <a href="Selby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Selby</a> and <a href="Goole" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goole</a>, and its name comes from the nearby village of <a href="Drax,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Drax</a>. Its generating capacity of 3,960 <a href="megawatt" title="wikilink">megawatts</a> is the highest of any power station in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, providing about 7% of the United Kingdom's electricity supply.</p>
<p>Opened in 1974 and extended in the mid-1980s, the station was initially operated by the <a href="Central_Electricity_Generating_Board" title="wikilink">Central Electricity Generating Board</a>, but since <a href="privatisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">privatisation</a> in 1990 the station has changed owner several times, and is currently operated by <a href="Drax_Group" title="wikilink">Drax Group plc</a>. Completed in 1986, Drax is the most recently built coal-fired power station, and by implementing technologies such as <a href="flue_gas_desulphurisation" title="wikilink">flue gas desulphurisation</a>, is one of the cleanest and most efficient coal-fired power stations in the UK.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, because of its large size, it is also the UK's single largest emitter of <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a>. In an attempt to reduce these emissions, the station is currently co-firing biomass and undergoing a turbine refurbishment, and there are plans to build a biomass only fired plant alongside the station, known as <a href="Drax_Ouse_Renewable_Energy_Plant" title="wikilink">Drax Ouse Renewable Energy Plant</a>.</p>

This will contribute to the station's aim to cut its CO<sub>2</sub> emmissions by 15%.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The station burns a large range of biomass fuels, but among them, the most used are <a href="wood_pellet" title="wikilink">wood pellets</a>, <a href="Sunflower" title="wikilink">sunflower pellets</a>, <a href="olive" class="uri" title="wikilink">olive</a>, <a href="peanut" title="wikilink">peanut shell husk</a> and <a href="rapeseed" title="wikilink">rape meal</a>. The majority of the station's biomass comes from overseas.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The station started to trial the co-firing of petcoke in one of its boilers in June 2005.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The trial ended in June 2007.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Over this period the boiler burned 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned in the station to make the price of the station's electricity more competetive as the price of running the station's FGD equipment was making the station's electricity more expensive. The <a href="Environment_Agency" title="wikilink">Environment Agency</a> (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by <a href="Friends_of_the_Earth" title="wikilink">Friends of the Earth</a> and <a href="Selby_(district)" title="wikilink">Selby Council</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> To meet their concerns, the station's emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the fuel's emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007, Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock anything up to 6,000 tonnes of the material on site.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

Coal is considered to be &quot;easily the most carbon-intensive and polluting form of energy generation available&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In 2007 Drax produced 22,160,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>, making it the largest single source of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Between 2000 and 2007, there has been a net increase in carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> of over 3,000,000 tonnes.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Drax power station also has the highest estimated emissions of <a href="nitrogen_oxide" title="wikilink">nitrogen oxide</a> (NO<sub>x</sub>) in the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, in a move to try and lower the station's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, Drax Group signed a &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 million contract with <a href="Siemens_Power_Generation" title="wikilink">Siemens Power Generation</a> to re-blade the station's steam turbines over the course of four years. This is the largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in the UK, and will increase the station's efficiency. This, coupled with the co-firing of <a href="biomass" class="uri" title="wikilink">biomass</a>, is part of a target to reduce the station's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 15% by 2011.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="protests-and-industrial-action">Protests and industrial action</h2>
<h3 id="climate-camp">Climate Camp</h3>
<p>On 31 August 2006, over 600 people attended a protest against the power station's high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the <a href="Camp_for_Climate_Action" title="wikilink">Camp for Climate Action</a> group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces were reported to have been drafted in for the duration of the protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested during the protest after after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="train-protest">Train protest</h3>
<p>At 8:00 am on 13 June 2008, more than 30 climate change campaigners halted a <a href="EWS" class="uri" title="wikilink">EWS</a> coal train en-route to Drax power station by disguising themselves as rail workers by wearing <a href="high-visibility_clothing" title="wikilink">high-visibility clothing</a> and waving <a href="red_flag" title="wikilink">red flags</a>. Stopping the train on a bridge crossing the <a href="River_Aire" title="wikilink">River Aire</a>, they scaled the wagons with the aid of the bridge's girders. They then mounted a banner reading &quot;Leave it in the ground&quot; to the side of the wagon and tied the train to the bridge, preventing it moving. They then shoveled more than 20 tonnes of coal on to the railway line. The protest lasted the whole day, until several protesters were removed from the train by police that night. The station's management said that the protest had no effect on power station's output. The action was also coordinated by Camp for Climate Action.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="worker-strike">Worker strike</h3>
<p>On 18 June 2009, less than 200 workers and contractors walked out of or failed to show up at Drax Power Station in a <a href="wildcat_strike" title="wikilink">wildcat strike</a>, showing solidarity with workers at the <a href="Lindsey_Oil_Refinery" title="wikilink">Lindsey Oil Refinery</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire</a> where 51 workers had been laid off while another employer on the site was employing.

<h3 id="biomass-power-station">Biomass power station</h3>

<p><a href="Drax_Group" title="wikilink">Drax Group</a> have applied for planning permission to build a new 300 MW power station, fueled entirely by biomass, to the north of the current power station site. The Ouse Renewable Energy Plant is expected to burn 1,400,000 tonnes of biomass each year, saving 1,850,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per annum. If the plans go ahead, 850 construction jobs will be created and 150 permanent jobs created once opened through direct and contract employment.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Plans were submitted for review by the <a href="Department_of_Energy_and_Climate_Change" title="wikilink">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> in July 2009.

Drax currently has made no statement on the viability of CCS technology at the power station. If it was necessary to install CCS technology at Drax, it would require the construction of new turbines and boilers, and a secure way of transporting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions  to the Yorkshire coast.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> <a href="Drax_Power_Limited" title="wikilink">Drax Power Limited</a> are sponsoring development studies into the technology and its application.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
