<h2 id="prelude-to-nazi-anti-tobacco-campaign">Prelude to Nazi anti-tobacco campaign</h2>
<p>Anti-tobacco sentiment and criticism of smoking existed in <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Germany</a> in the early 1910s, long before the <a href="Nazi#History" title="wikilink">advent of the Nazis</a>. Critics of smoking organized the first group in the country named the <em>Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher</em> (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for a brief period only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner</em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in <a href="Trautenau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trautenau</a>, <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a>. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of <a href="Hanover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanover</a> and <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a>. In 1920, a <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei</em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, after <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a> was separated from <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> at the end of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. A <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in <a href="Deutsch&lt;U+00F6&gt;sterreich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deutsch&lt;U+00F6&gt;sterreich</a></em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Austria) was established in <a href="Graz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Graz</a> in 1920.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>These groups started publishing journals critical of smoking. The first such <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German language</a> journal was <em>Der Tabakgegner</em> (The Tobacco Opponents), published by the Bohemian organization. This journal was published between 1912 and 1932. The <em>Deutsche Tabakgegner</em> (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden, and was the second journal on this issue, being published from 1919 to 1935.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Apart from opposing tobacco smoking, the anti-tobacco organizations were against consumption of <a href="Ethanol#Alcoholic_beverages" title="wikilink">alcohol</a> also.

<p>Hitler felt regret over the fact that military personnel were permitted to smoke, and during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> he said on March 2, 1942, &quot;it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war&quot;. He also said that it was &quot;not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking&quot;. He promised to terminate the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged people who he knew very well not to smoke and rewarded those who <a href="Smoking_cessation" title="wikilink">quit smoking</a>. However Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco was not the main cause behind Nazi anti-tobacco movement; it was only one of several catalysts behind the anti-smoking campaign.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reproductive-policies">Reproductive policies</h2>
<p>The Nazi <a href="Nazi_Germany#Women&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">reproductive policies</a> were a significant factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature <a href="ageing" title="wikilink">aging</a> and loss of <a href="physical_attractiveness" title="wikilink">physical attractiveness</a> and were generally viewed as being not very suitable for their roles as wives and mothers of a German family. Werner Huttig of the <a href="Nazi_Party" title="wikilink">Nazi Party</a>'s <em><a href="Office_of_Racial_Policy" title="wikilink">Rassenpolitisches Amt</a></em> (Office of Racial Politics) claimed that <a href="breast_milk" title="wikilink">breast milk</a> of smoking mothers was revealed to contain <a href="nicotine" class="uri" title="wikilink">nicotine</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Martin Staemmler, a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in increasing the number of <a href="stillbirth" title="wikilink">stillbirths</a> and <a href="miscarriage" title="wikilink">miscarriages</a>. The responsibility of smoking for miscarriages was also supported by well-known female <a href="racial_hygiene" title="wikilink">racial hygienist</a> Agnes Bluhm, who in a book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted the German women to give birth to more children. An article published in a German <a href="gynaecology" class="uri" title="wikilink">gynaecology</a> journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more prone to remain childless compared to women who did not smoke.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Research and studies on the effects of tobacco on the health of the population was more advanced in Germany than any nation by the time the Nazis came to power.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>. The <a href="Lung_cancer#Smoking" title="wikilink">link</a> between <a href="lung_cancer" title="wikilink">lung cancer</a> and tobacco was first proved in Germany before the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> contrary to the popular belief that <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> and <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> scientists first discovered it in the 1950s.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The term &quot;<a href="passive_smoking" title="wikilink">passive smoking</a>&quot; (&quot;<em>Passivrauchen</em>&quot;) was coined in Germany<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> by Prof. Fritz Lickint, who also outlined the link between active smoking and lung cancer as part of his pioneering work on the health consequences of tobacco. In 1930, Lickint published a paper entitled &quot;Tobacco and tobacco smoke as <a href="Etiology" title="wikilink">aetiological</a> factors for carcinoma&quot;, which was one the earliest, if not the first review papers on the subject. This paper included 167 literature citations. Lickint belonged to the <a href="Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> (SPD), a party opposed to the Nazis, which Hitler banned in 1933. He was also a member of the <em>Vereins sozialistischer &lt;U+00C4&gt;rzte</em> (Association of socialist doctors) and was dismissed in 1934 from his position at K&lt;U+00FC&gt;chwald hospital in <a href="Chemnitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chemnitz</a> by the Nazis.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's 1939 medical dissertation was the world's first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer. Apart from mentioning the increasing incidents of lung cancer and the general causes behind it like dust, exhaust gas from cars, <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, X-ray and pollutants emitted from factories, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's paper pointed out that &quot;the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Physicians in the Third Reich were aware of the fact that smoking is responsible for <a href="cardiac_disease" title="wikilink">cardiac diseases</a>, which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of <a href="myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">myocardial infarction</a> in the country. In the later years of World War II, nicotine was viewed by researchers as a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">Eastern Front</a>. A pathologist of the <a href="Heer_(1935-1945)" title="wikilink">Heer</a> examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were &quot;enthusiastic smokers.&quot; He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are &quot;a coronary poison of the first order.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

Some well-known health magazines like the <em>Gesundes Volk</em> (Healthy People) published warnings regarding the effects of smoking. Posters showing the harmful effects of smoking were published and anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces. Anti-smoking messages were spread through the <a href="Hitler_Youth" title="wikilink">Hitler-Jugend</a> (HJ) and the <a href="League_of_German_Girls" title="wikilink">Bund Deutscher M&lt;U+00E4&gt;del</a> (BDM).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the <em>Reichsstelle f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Rauschgiftbek&lt;U+00E4&gt;mpfung</em> (Bureau for the Struggle against Addictive Drugs) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign.

<p>After recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis.

Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or smoking as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also made illegal.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Restrictions on smoking were introduced in the Wehrmacht also. Any soldier in the Wehrmacht was not given more than six cigarettes a day. Often extra cigarettes were sold to the soldiers, especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground, however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht's <a href="Women%27s_roles_in_the_World_Wars#Germany" title="wikilink">female auxiliary personnel</a>. Medical lectures were also arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking. An ordinance was enacted on November 3, 1941 which raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80%-95% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany for more than 25 years after the <a href="Nazi_Germany#Capitulation_of_German_forces" title="wikilink">collapse of the Nazi regime</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="racism-and-anti-smoking-sentiment">Racism and anti-smoking sentiment</h3>
<p>There is some controversy over the attitude of the Nazis for the anti-tobacco movement as they equated the anti-tobacco campaign with both <a href="racism" class="uri" title="wikilink">racism</a> and <a href="antisemitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">antisemitism</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Apart from the public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The anti-tobacco movement was influenced by the ideological concept of <a href="racial_hygiene" title="wikilink">racial hygiene</a> and bodily purity.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Nazi leaders held a view that it was not right for the <a href="master_race" title="wikilink">master race</a> to smoke<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> and tobacco consumption became equal to &quot;racial degeneracy&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> According to the Nazi view, tobacco was a &quot;genetic poison&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> and racial hygienists opposed tobacco out of the fear that tobacco would &quot;corrupt&quot; the &quot;German germ plasm&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a &quot;vice&quot; of the &quot;degenerate&quot; <a href="African" title="wikilink">Africans</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antisemitism-in-the-anti-tobacco-campaign">Antisemitism in the anti-tobacco campaign</h3>
<p>The Nazis often equated the <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jews</a> with the harmful effects of tobacco. The <a href="Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="wikilink">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> <a href="Johann_von_Leers" title="wikilink">Johann von Leers</a>, editor of the <em>Nordische Welt</em> (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the <em>Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren</em> in 1941, proclaimed that &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot; was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a>, which was the principal European entry point of <em><a href="Nicotiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicotiana</a></em>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="after-world-war-ii">After World War II</h2>
<p>After the collapse of the Nazi Germany at the <a href="End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe" title="wikilink">end of World War II</a>, <a href=":Category:Tobacco_companies_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American cigarette manufactures</a> quickly entered the German market. Illegal <a href="smuggling" class="uri" title="wikilink">smuggling</a> of tobacco became prevalent,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and the majority of the leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were silenced by various methods.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In 1949, approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month. In 1954, nearly two billion <a href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. As part of the <a href="Marshall_Plan" title="wikilink">Marshall Plan</a>, the United States sent tobacco free of cost to Germany: the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24000 tons and reaching as many as 69000 tons in 1949. The <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Federal government of the United States</a> spent $70 million in this scheme, to the delight of cigarette manufacturing companies in the United States, who were making a huge profit out of it.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in <a href="History_of_Germany_since_1945" title="wikilink">post-war Germany</a> steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963. The present day anti-tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939-1941 and the situation of German tobacco health research at the end of the 20th century is described by <a href="Robert_N._Proctor" title="wikilink">Robert N. Proctor</a> as being &quot;muted&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
