Lunn transferred to Ford plant in <a href="Dagenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dagenham</a> as the car&lt;U+2019&gt;s product planning manager to follow the 105-E into <a href="mass_production" title="wikilink">mass production</a>.</p>
<p>He <a href="Emmigration" title="wikilink">emigrated</a> to the United States in 1958 and became manager of the Ford Advanced Vehicle center. He participated in the development of a  <a href="gross_vehicle_weight_rating" title="wikilink">gross vehicle weight rating</a> highway <a href="truck" class="uri" title="wikilink">truck</a>, as well as the Cardinal, Ford&lt;U+2019&gt;s first <a href="front-wheel_drive" title="wikilink">front-wheel drive</a> automobile that became the 15-M <a href="Ford_Taunus" title="wikilink">Taunus</a>.</p>
<p>In 1962, Lunn became a U.S. citizen. In 1962, Lunn and his team of engineers developed a two-seat <a href="Ford_Mustang_I" title="wikilink">Ford Mustang I</a> prototype in just 100 days.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was also put on a special assignment to design and develop a GT racing car along with Ray Geddes and <a href="Donald_N._Frey" title="wikilink">Donald N. Frey</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Ford's CEO, <a href="Henry_Ford_II" title="wikilink">Henry Ford II</a>, conceived this racing program after his attempt to purchase <a href="Ferrari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ferrari</a> collapsed. In 1963, under the direction of Lunn, work began on an all-new racecar, loosely based on the <a href="Lola_Racing_Cars" title="wikilink">Lola GT</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In April 1964, the <a href="Ford_GT40" title="wikilink">Ford GT40</a> was presented to the press for the first time.</p>

Lunn was charged to build the &quot;ultimate Mustang&quot; and worked with Kar Kraft, the <a href="Brighton,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Brighton, Michigan</a>, specialty shop that built many of Ford's racing cars at the time, to produce the <a href="Boss_429" title="wikilink">Boss 429</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="american-motors">American Motors</h2>
<p>Lunn joined American Motors in 1971 as the director of engineering for <a href="Jeep" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jeep</a>, which had recently been purchased by AMC from Kaiser. Lunn quickly advanced at AMC to the position of Vice President of Engineering. His notable accomplishments include the <a href="AMC_Eagle" title="wikilink">AMC Eagle</a>, the compact <a href="Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ)" title="wikilink">Jeep Cherokee (XJ)</a>, which was the first of the modern range of SUV vehicles, as well as the development of the <a href="AMC_Straight-4_engine" title="wikilink">AMC Straight-4 engine</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the Jeep 4.0 Liter engine that were based on the &quot;modern era&quot; <a href="AMC_Straight-6_engine" title="wikilink">AMC Straight-6 engine</a>.</p>
<p>As Jeep's chief engineer, Lunn orchestrated 4WD's next leap ahead when he joined the <a href="AMC_Concord" title="wikilink">AMC Concord</a> body with a reconstituted Jeep driveline. According to former AMC chairman, <a href="Gerald_C._Meyers" title="wikilink">Gerald C. Meyers</a>, &quot;our initial reaction to Lunn's concoction was, 'What the hell is it?' The body was raised an extra four inches for transfer-case clearance and the wheel wells were wide open.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This became the AMC Eagle, which was America&lt;U+2019&gt;s first four-wheel drive car.</p>
<p>Lunn was also active in the <a href="Society_of_Automotive_Engineers" title="wikilink">Society of Automotive Engineers</a> (SAE International) becoming their technical committee chairman in 1983. He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1985.</p>
<p>He completed his career at American Motors by forming and becoming President of Renault Jeep Sport to centralize all AMC and Renault racing activities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Lunn also designed and put into production a low-cost racing car for the <a href="Sports_Car_Club_of_America" title="wikilink">Sports Car Club of America</a> (SCCA), of which more than 864 <strong>Sports Renault</strong> purpose-built race cars (later: <a href="Spec_Racer_Ford" title="wikilink">Spec Racer Ford</a>) have been built.</p>
<p>In 1984 he headed the first American entry to drive the <a href="Dakar_Rally" title="wikilink">Paris-Dakar rally</a>. He retired in 1985 and was immediately called back to become vice president of engineering for the <a href="AM_General" title="wikilink">AM General</a> division of AMC. The <a href="High_Mobility_Multipurpose_Wheeled_Vehicle" title="wikilink">High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle</a> military Jeep (Hummer) was going into production and Lunn was charged with overseeing the corrective actions to achieve acceptance by the U.S. Army.</p>
