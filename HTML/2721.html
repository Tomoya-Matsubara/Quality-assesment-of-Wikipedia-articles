<h2 id="world-war-i">World War I</h2>

<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>
<p>In 1938 Chamberlin became assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of <a href="United_States_War_Department" title="wikilink">War Department</a> General Staff.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> At this time the United States was embarking on a military build up in response to a worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated to construction under the Expansion Program, as it became known.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On 7 May 1940, the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, Major General <a href="Richard_C._Moore" title="wikilink">Richard C. Moore</a>, G-4 of the War Department General Staff asked for an estimate of the cost to house an additional 1,200,000 men and was baulked at the estimate he received of $800 per head.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> To save on the cost of cantonments, Moore decided not paint them. Chamberlin disagreed on the grounds that paint would reduce maintenance costs. <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Franklin_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin Roosevelt</a> intervened and directed that the buildings be painted. As a result, an order was placed for  of paint, resulting in an $11 million budget shortfall.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Chamberlin was promoted to <a href="Colonel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">colonel</a> on 14 February 1941.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Commenting after the war on the construction program, he wrote: </p>
<p>In January 1942, Chamberlin was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, of US Army Forces in Australia, arriving by air from Washington, D.C., on 9 January. He soon became Chief of Staff of US Army Forces in Australia, first under Major General <a href="Julian_F._Barnes" title="wikilink">Julian F. Barnes</a>, and then under his successor, <a href="Lieutenant_General_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George_Brett_(general)" title="wikilink">George H. Brett</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Chamberlin was promoted to <a href="Brigadier_General_(United_States)" title="wikilink">brigadier general</a> on 15 February 1942.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="General_(United_States)" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> arrived in Australia on 17 March to become <a href="Supreme_Commander" title="wikilink">Supreme Commander</a> of the newly established <a href="South_West_Pacific_Area_(command)" title="wikilink">Southwest Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), which now included the US Army Forces in Australia.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On 19 April, MacArthur formally established his General Headquarters (GHQ), and Chamberlin was appointed its Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>As G-3, Chamberlin was one of the most highly rated members of the GHQ staff, although not being part of the &quot;Bataan Gang&quot; - the group of officers who had escaped with MacArthur from the Philippines - made him something of an outsider at GHQ.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Chamberlin was responsible for planning and overseeing execution of MacArthur's major operations, including the <a href="New_Guinea_Campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>, <a href="Philippines_campaign_(1944&lt;U+2013&gt;45)" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and <a href="Borneo_Campaign_(1945)" title="wikilink">Borneo</a> campaigns. One member of the staff later recalled: </p>
<p>Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin differed with one of his planners, Brigadier General <a href="Bonner_Fellers" title="wikilink">Bonner Fellers</a>, over a proposed landing at <a href="Hansa_Bay" title="wikilink">Hansa Bay</a>. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>One of Chamberlin's challenges was working with the Australians. Their decentralised mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of great frustration, as it was difficult to extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General <a href="Frank_Berryman" title="wikilink">Frank Berryman</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>When MacArthur began looking for a new chief of staff to replace Lieutenant General <a href="Richard_K._Sutherland" title="wikilink">Richard K. Sutherland</a> in 1945, he consider but rejected giving the post to Chamberlin.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Chamberlin became Deputy Chief of Staff in February 1946, and was briefly acting as Chief of Staff from 2 May to 10 June 1946. For his services in the Southwest Pacific and the <a href="Occupation_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Occupation of Japan</a>, Chamberlin was awarded three <a href="Army_Distinguished_Service_Medal" title="wikilink">Army Distinguished Service Medals</a> and the <a href="Silver_Star" title="wikilink">Silver Star</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In September 1946, he was one of five American major generals who was made an honorary <a href="Commander_of_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Commander of Order of the British Empire</a> in the Military Division for his work with US Army Forces in Australia and GHQ SWPA.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
