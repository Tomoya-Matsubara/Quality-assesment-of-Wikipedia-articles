<p>The National Rail Administration has developed a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, which may or may not be built as a <a href="tram-train" class="uri" title="wikilink">tram-train</a>, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.</p>
<p>The &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd Line is a  long railway which branches from the S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rland Line at Ganddal. It runs via <a href="Foss-Eikeland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foss-Eikeland</a> and <a href="Figgjo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Figgjo</a> to <a href="&lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd</a>,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and was opened on 20 December 1924.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Passenger services were terminated on on 1 November 1955, making it the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to be closed. Feight trains operated until the 1988.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The first  are used for freight trains to access a cement factory. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The annual traffic potential for the &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd Line is 600,000 passengers. Plans call for stations at <a href="Vagle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vagle</a>, Figgjo, <a href="Kongeparken" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kongeparken</a> and &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd. It is possible to operate the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd without new infrastructure investments to the S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rland Line. However, the line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. &lt;U+00C5&gt;lg&lt;U+00E5&gt;rd is also a good location for a <a href="park_and_ride" title="wikilink">park and ride</a> for <a href="European_route_E39" title="wikilink">European Route E39</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>A branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to <a href="Sola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sola</a> and the airport. The line would branch from the S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, <a href="Solakrossen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solakrossen</a>, <a href="Forus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forus</a> West, <a href="Statoil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Statoil</a>'s head office and possibly the shopping center <a href="Kvadrat_(shopping_centre)" title="wikilink">Kvadrat</a>. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. This will give about 2.5 million annual passengers.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="J&lt;U+00E5&gt;tt&lt;U+00E5&gt;v&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen_holdeplass.JPG" title="fig:J&lt;U+00E5&gt;tt&lt;U+00E5&gt;v&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen Station opened in 2009 along the new double track section" alt="J&lt;U+00E5&gt;tt&lt;U+00E5&gt;v&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen Station opened in 2009 along the new double track section" /> Plans have been made that would either double or triple the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to N&lt;U+00E6&gt;rbo terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the J&lt;U+00E6&gt;ren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between . However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>When the J&lt;U+00E6&gt;ren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rland Line, the station was moved  north of the city center. <a href="Egersund_Station" title="wikilink">Egersund Station</a> has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rland Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Rogaland County Municipality is in the planning process of building a light rail in Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a  line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a  branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the light rail at Stavanger, Paradis, J&lt;U+00E5&gt;tt&lt;U+00E5&gt;v&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
