Two light novels written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi were published in April 2004 and December 2007; four official guidebooks written and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi have also been released.</p>
<p><a href="Del_Rey_Manga" title="wikilink">Del Rey Manga</a> publishes the English translation of <em>School Rumble</em>. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to preserve <a href="pun" title="wikilink">puns</a> based on the characters' names. <a href="Funimation_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Funimation Entertainment</a> published the first and second anime seasons and the <em>Extra Class</em> OVAs in English. <em>School Rumble</em> has been translated into additional languages, although the final two episodes, the video games, and guidebooks have yet to be released outside Japan.</p>
<p>The manga was well received by Japanese-language readers; several volumes have appeared in the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered around some of the jokes and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and&lt;U+2014&gt;for the English-language translation&lt;U+2014&gt;critics. The decision by <a href="Media_Factory" title="wikilink">Media Factory</a> to aggressively pursue its <a href="intellectual_property_rights" title="wikilink">intellectual property rights</a> for <em>School Rumble</em> is believed to have had a negative impact on the franchise's release and sales in the <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American</a> market.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p><em>School Rumble</em> is a romantic comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, as well as their friends and families. The main female <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> is <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Tenma" title="wikilink">Tenma Tsukamoto</a>, an unremarkable second-year high school student<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Oji_Karasuma" title="wikilink">Oji Karasuma</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Oji. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in <a href="curry" class="uri" title="wikilink">curry</a>. The main male protagonist, <a href="Juvenile_delinquency" title="wikilink">delinquent</a> <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Harima" title="wikilink">Kenji Harima</a>, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Harima complicates the <a href="love_triangle" title="wikilink">love triangle</a> through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Eri_Sawachika" title="wikilink">Eri Sawachika</a>, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Yakumo" title="wikilink">Yakumo Tsukamoto</a>, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Haruki_Hanai" title="wikilink">Haruki Hanai</a>, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared <a href="surname" class="uri" title="wikilink">surname</a> causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.</p>
<p>Although <em>School Rumble</em> focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Mikoto_Suo" title="wikilink">Mikoto Suo</a>, who runs a <a href="kenp&lt;U+014D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">kenp&lt;U+014D&gt;</a> <a href="dojo" class="uri" title="wikilink">dojo</a> where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Akira_Takano" title="wikilink">Akira Takano</a>, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.</p>
<p>The series ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, the status of his relationship with Yakumo is uncertain.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development-and-production">Development and production</h2>
<p><a href="Jin_Kobayashi" title="wikilink">Jin Kobayashi</a> began writing <em>School Rumble</em>, his debut work, in 2002.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He stated to an audience at <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a>'s 2006 <a href="Kawaii_Kon" title="wikilink">Kawaii Kon</a> convention that he started writing the series because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Kobayashi's favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates &quot;about 30%&quot; of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that <a href="List_of_School_Rumble_characters#Ryuuhei_Suga" title="wikilink">Ryuuhei Suga</a>, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he heard the voice actors' (<em><a href="seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;</a></em>) interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes &quot;if there's no misunderstanding then there's no funny story.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Kobayashi and his editor collaborated on the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic illustrations for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> As the series' <em><a href="mangaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">mangaka</a></em>, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano,, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she should be on the cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of <em>School Rumble Z</em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>An anime adaption of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi, and he was skeptical of the project when first approached. Negotiations and preparation took some time, but he claims to be happy with the end result.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On viewing the first anime footage, Kobayashi was astonished; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time, stating &quot;I was incredibly touched by it. Completely overcome.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Impressed with the adaptation of his work, he praises the anime staff for their achievement, although conceding that <em>School Rumble</em> probably lent itself to the anime format.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He cites the fishing episode, for which he supplied the voice acting for several minor parts, as his favorite.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Kobayashi allowed the <em>seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> who voiced his characters significant freedom to interpret them as they chose.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> There were a number of cast changes throughout the production; <a href="Ami_Koshimizu" title="wikilink">Ami Koshimizu</a>, the <em>seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> for Tenma, had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and between <em>School Rumble</em>{{'}}s first and second seasons the <em>seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;</em> for both Karen Ichijou and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. <a href="Mako_Sakurai" title="wikilink">Mako Sakurai</a> took over Karen's role from <a href="Yuuka_Nanri" title="wikilink">Yuuka Nanri</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and <a href="Aya_Hirano" title="wikilink">Aya Hirano</a> replaced <a href="Akiko_Kurumado" title="wikilink">Akiko Kurumado</a> as Yoko.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The artbox design for <a href="Funimation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funimation</a>'s <a href="Region_1" title="wikilink">North American</a> release of the <em>School Rumble</em> anime resembles a miniature metal locker, and each of the individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets.

<h2 id="sales">Sales</h2>
<p>The <em>School Rumble</em> manga had a successful sales run in Japan and the North American English market. In Japan, several volumes managed to chart: Volume 13 was the ninth best-selling manga for the week of June 21, 2006, before falling to tenth the following week;<ref></p>

<p></ref> Volume 15 reached 4th place for the week of December 20, also falling to 10th the following week;<ref></p>

<p>Similarly, the anime adaptation of <em>School Rumble</em> also sold very well in Japan according to the <a href="Oricon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oricon</a> charts. The Japanese DVD release of <em>First Semester</em> saw fluctuating sales for each volume with each charting within the top 45.<ref></p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<h3 id="manga-series">Manga series</h3>
<p>Although generally well-received, the manga has also attracted some criticism. Eduardo M. Chavez, of Mania.com, recalls being initially put off by the title, which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional. After glancing through the first volume, he was surprised to find his assumption wrong, and concluded that it was appropriately named. While he gives a largely positive review, Chavez finds the series' artwork &quot;simple&quot; and unimpressive.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi's ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the <em>mangaka</em> for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing <em>School Rumble</em> from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the &quot;flat&quot; chapters dealing with Yakumo.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> In the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters &quot;grow up&quot;, although acknowledging that while the manga's style suits his personal preferences it will not be not to everyone's taste.<ref></p>

<p></ref></p>
<p>Sakura Eries, also of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, and eight to eleven positive ratings overall.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> She noted that volume five may appeal to readers more interested in the side characters, and that appreciating Kobayashi's humor in the second half of chapter eight &quot;requires a bit more mental effort&quot;.<ref></p>

<p></ref> In volume ten, she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used clich&lt;U+00E9&gt; of a disastrous school play, he manages to add enough twists to make it unique. The play's climax, however, confused her more than it amused her.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>Carlo Santos, of <a href="Anime_News_Network" title="wikilink">Anime News Network</a>, gave the English releases of volumes two, three, four, and seven mixed&lt;U+2014&gt;but largely favorable&lt;U+2014&gt;B-range reviews. Volume nine he awards a C rating. He approved of the character of Harima, particularly enjoying jokes comparing him to <a href="St._Francis_of_Assisi" title="wikilink">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Santos found the bonus chapters in volumes three and four, that deal with Yakumo, touching.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> On the other hand, he criticizes various aspects of the artwork and, by volume seven, laments the staleness of recycled jokes.<ref></p>

<p></ref><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Despite volume nine's strong start, by its end he relates that, although there were some funny moments, he had become weary of its repetitive plot.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> A fellow reviewer from Anime News Network, Carl Kimlinger, decided after reviewing four volumes that while the early volumes do not assist plot development, neither do they detract from the manga's appeal; he too had a positive impression overall.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Kimlinger found the later volumes better and more entertaining, although not always during the romantic moments.<ref></p>

<p></ref></p>
<p>Chavez praised Del Rey's translation for retaining the manga's original identity; the header, bumper artwork, character biographies, and front covers are all but identical to the Japanese.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Eries also thanked Del Rey's translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her,<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anime-series">Anime series</h3>
<p>Like the manga, the anime has been well received but does not avoid criticism; in particular the quality of the animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stories are really quite simple as well as being things we've seen done dozens of times before. Yet it manages to infuse it with a great deal of fun and humor even if it is familiar. There's a certain energy here that works in the shows  favor as well as bringing in some different elements in terms of the characters. It also doesn't hurt that several of the characters really are quite dim which is a nice contrast from the usual kind of leads.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer,<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>While <em>School Rumble</em> is generally recognised as a <a href="sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen_manga" title="wikilink">sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen</a> title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for <a href="About.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">About.com</a>, refers to it as a <a href="sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo_manga" title="wikilink">sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo</a> title aimed at girls and young women.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Lisa Marie, reviewer for <a href="RightStuf" class="uri" title="wikilink">RightStuf</a>'s <em>Anime Today</em> <a href="podcast" class="uri" title="wikilink">podcast</a>, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Luther calls the first DVD &quot;the perfect back-to-school accessory&quot;,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> while Marie characterizes <em>School Rumble</em> as &quot;insane&quot;, asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like <em><a href="Excel_Saga" title="wikilink">Excel Saga</a></em> and <em><a href="Har&lt;U+00E9&gt;_+_Guu" title="wikilink">Har&lt;U+00E9&gt; + Guu</a></em>. However, it uses its &quot;cast to break[...]every rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [that] it takes you a moment to realize what just happened doesn't make any sense.&quot;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> A fan of the sub-genre, she praises the anime it for its <a href="surreal_humour" title="wikilink">surreal humour</a>,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> and for being &quot;anime newbie friendly&quot; in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin&lt;U+2014&gt;such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" title="wikilink">Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;giving the series broad appeal.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>Anime News Network's reviewers found much to enjoy about the first series, although Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be &quot;watched in small doses, as trying to tackle too much of it in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Carl Kimlinger comments that &quot;from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times&quot;,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> and that the title is &quot;two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon&quot;.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that &quot;although this disc technically marks the end of [the first season of] <em>School Rumble</em>, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value,<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, foundhis early indifference fading as the story develops.<ref name="Moure2"></p>

<p></ref> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>'s Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five.<ref></p>





<p></ref> Jakub Lhota of the <a href="cz:Czechoslovak_Anime_E-Zine" title="wikilink"><em>Czechoslovak Anime E-Zine</em></a> rated the first season a 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> and the style&lt;U+2014&gt;if not always the color<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for <em>School Rumble</em>{{'}}s English translation of the first season was welcomed.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Theron Martin, the OVA series <em>School Rumble: Extra Class</em> was made mostly for devoted fans; claiming that familiarity with the series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came to the view that it may also be useful as a sampler of the series.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that &quot;make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker&quot;. However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to <em>School Rumble</em>, due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post commentary on the preview announcement for the second season, claiming &quot;we assume if you loved <em>School Rumble</em>, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?&quot;<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> David F. Smith from IGN gave the first part of season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for <a href="sight_gag" title="wikilink">sight gags</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;something he notes that other companies do.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive,<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. He complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
