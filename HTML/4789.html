Her foundation charter gave to the college the land and buildings of White Hall, a university hall that had experienced a decline in student numbers. Price added new buildings to those of White Hall, and construction work continued after his death in 1574. The first of the college's <a href="Quadrangle_(architecture)" title="wikilink">quadrangles</a>, which included the hall, chapel, and principal's lodgings, was completed between 1621 and 1630. Construction of the second quadrangle began in the 1630s; but was interrupted by the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a> and was not completed until about 1712. Further buildings were erected in a third quadrangle during the 20th century, including science laboratories (now closed), a library for undergraduates, and additional accommodation for students and <a href="Oxbridge_Fellow" title="wikilink">fellows</a>. In addition to the main site, the college owns flats in east and north Oxford, and a sports ground.</p>
<p>The chapel, which was dedicated in 1621 and extended in 1636, was extensively altered in 1864 under the supervision of the architect <a href="George_Edmund_Street" title="wikilink">George Edmund Street</a>. The alterations have had their supporters and their critics; one historian of the college (<a href="Ernest_George_Hardy" title="wikilink">Ernest Hardy</a>, principal from 1921 to 1925) described the work as &quot;ill-considered&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The hall's original <a href="hammerbeam_roof" title="wikilink">hammerbeam roof</a> was hidden by a plaster ceiling in 1741 when rooms were installed in the roofspace. The principal's lodgings, the last part of the first quadrangle to be constructed, contain wooden panelling from the early 17th century. The Fellows' Library in the second quadrangle dates from 1679 and contains 11,000 antiquarian books; it was restored at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;700,000 in 2007. A new <a href="Junior_Common_Room" title="wikilink">Junior Common Room</a>, about twice the size of its predecessor, was completed in the third quadrangle in 2002, and a &lt;U+00A3&gt;7.3 million project to build new student and teaching rooms in Ship Street, opposite the college, is due to be completed in June 2010.</p>
<p>Eleven parts of the college are <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed buildings</a>, including all four sides of the first and second quadrangles. Nine parts, including the chapel, hall, and principal's lodgings, have the highest Grade I designation, given to buildings of exceptional interest. Two other parts (an external wall and an early 20th-century addition in the third quadrangle) have a Grade II designation, given to buildings of national importance and special interest. The architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus_Pevsner" title="wikilink">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a> described the first quadrangle as &quot;small and pretty&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and said that the <a href="reredos" class="uri" title="wikilink">reredos</a> behind the chapel altar was &quot;heavily gorgeous&quot;;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> he was, however, critical of the Old Members' Building in the third quadrangle, opened in 1971, describing it as a &quot;mannered and modish design&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The historian <a href="John_Julius_Norwich" title="wikilink">John Julius Norwich</a> said that the first quadrangle had &quot;a curious charm&quot;,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> while the second quadrangle had &quot;a strong feeling of unity owing to the somewhat relentless succession of ogival gables&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The poet <a href="John_Betjeman" title="wikilink">Sir John Betjeman</a> said that the clear planning of the first and second quadrangles, coupled with the relationship of their size to the heights of the buildings around them, &quot;make what would be undistinguished buildings judged on their detail, into something distinguished&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, he regarded the early 20th-century additions in the third quadrangle as &quot;dull&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

The charter also gave the buildings of White Hall, one of a number of university halls in this location.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Halls provided lodgings and meals for students at the university, and sometimes lectures and tuition as well.

As part of the work, carried out by the architects Maguire &amp; Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new <a href="Junior_Common_Room" title="wikilink">Junior Common Room</a> (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a> The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fellows-garden">Fellows' Garden</h3>
<p>The Fellows' Garden runs behind the west side of the second quadrangle, behind the SCR; it can be reached from there or from the third quadrangle. It dates from 1683, when 3s 6d<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a> was spent on making a garden; it would have been about  long and between  wide, but a further purchase of land in 1735 extended its length to about . It is now overshadowed by adjoining buildings (including the Old Members' Building).<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> The college archivist, Brigid Allen, has described it as &quot;a kind of gated tunnel between high buildings, paved, scattered with seats and tables, and filled with gloomy foliage of the purple-leaved plum&quot;.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-buildings">Other buildings</h2>
<p><img src="Ship_Street_houses.jpg" title="fig:Houses on Ship Street" alt="Houses on Ship Street" /> The college purchased  of land in east Oxford (near the <a href="Cowley_Road,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Cowley Road</a>) in 1903 for use as a sports ground.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a> The 1905 pavilion was replaced in 1998 by a new pavilion on the opposite side of the sports ground; the old pavilion is now used as a table-tennis room (ground floor) with a three-bedroomed flat for graduates above. Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House).<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a><a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> Writing in 1974, Pevsner said that Thelwall House was one of the recent college buildings that deserved note.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a></p>
<p>A further development, known as Hazel Court (after <a href="Alfred_Hazel" title="wikilink">Alfred Hazel</a>, principal 1925&lt;U+2013&gt;1944), was built in 2000, bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> Writing in the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire &amp; Co., for their &quot;crispness of detail&quot; and &quot;richness of composition&quot;; he said that &quot;the sense of ordered space ... recalls the way in which the traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university&quot;.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a> He noted that, whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with the air of a courtyard garden, &quot;closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility&quot;;<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> there was, he wrote, &quot;the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use&quot;.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> However, he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside, the furniture &quot;would not look out of place in a motorway hotel&quot;.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
<p>Donations from <a href="Edwin_Stevens" title="wikilink">Edwin Stevens</a>, an Old Member of the college, enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north Oxford on the <a href="Woodstock_Road" title="wikilink">Woodstock Road</a>, named &quot;Stevens Close&quot; in his honour.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> The flats were opened by <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1976.<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> The college also owns a number of houses on Ship Street, which are used for student accommodation.<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> It has purchased a further site in Ship Street at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.8M, which will be converted at a projected cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;5.5M to provide 31 student rooms with en-suite facilities, a 100-seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a><a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a> The site includes a <a href="bastion" class="uri" title="wikilink">bastion</a> from the Oxford city wall, which is a <a href="scheduled_ancient_monument" title="wikilink">scheduled ancient monument</a>.<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"><sup>368</sup></a> The plans provide for the inner curve of the bastion to be used as a featured alcove in the ground floor reception area and for study bedrooms on the upper floors.<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a> The project is due to be completed in June 2010.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a></p>
