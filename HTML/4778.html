After Williams College, Waller considered being a <a href="lawyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawyer</a>, <a href="businessman" class="uri" title="wikilink">businessman</a> or government worker. However, after his brother William advised against Waller's becoming a government worker or businessman, he decided instead to become a minister. He attended the <a href="Princeton_Theological_Seminary" title="wikilink">Princeton Theological Seminary</a>. Here Waller also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He graduated from this institution in 1837.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Waller preached in <a href="Espy,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Espy</a> since at least 1857.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Due to the size of his ministry, he was never able to preach at a given church more than once every two weeks. Most churches he only preached at once a month. Despite this, he typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. His ministry was started on a small wood church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. Initially his salary was $600.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Waller was also a counsel in <a href="ecclesiastical" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecclesiastical</a> trials. He went to the <a href="General_Assembly_(presbyterian_church)" title="wikilink">General Assemblies</a> in 1844, 1853, 1861, 1865 to 1867, 1876, 1886, and 1890.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He was interested in foreign <a href="Mission_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">missions</a> and devoted one service per month to news from foreign missions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Waller was chosen to be a member of the Board of Foreign Missions in 1865.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He was elected to the position of Moderator of Presbytery in 1842, 1851, and 1881. At that time he was the only person to be elected to that position more than once.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to preaching at churches, Waller also revived, organized, or founded a number of them. In 1839 he revived the Hidlay Church and a church at Berwick. Waller and two other people officially organized the <a href="Presbyterian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> church in Orangeville in October 1843. Waller and three other people also attempted to organize a church it Catawissa but this attempt was unsuccessful. In 1856 Waller traveled to <a href="Schuylkill_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Schuylkill County</a> and preached in churches there numerous times. In 1857 he and two other people organized a church in <a href="Ashland,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Ashland</a> in Schuylkill County.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="land-purchase-and-sale">Land purchase and sale</h2>
<p>Waller owned 20 percent (900 acres) of the land in Bloomsburg at some time, which is more than any other person has held in the town to date as well as some land in other parts of Columbia County and the <a href="Wyoming_Valley" title="wikilink">Wyoming Valley</a>. Waller's lands in Bloomsburg primarily included northeastern, southeastern, and south-central Bloomsburg, but also included some small areas of land near Bloomsburg's border with <a href="Hemlock_Township,_Columbia_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Hemlock Township</a>. He sold some of his land, but also donated parts of it by selling those areas for $1.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Waller developed a number of community features on this land, including five churches, the Columbia County Courthouse and Jail, and several industries such as the Magee Carpet Company and the Bloomsburg Silk Mills. In 1870 Waller sold three acres of land on Seventh Street in Bloomsburg for the purpose of building a <a href="park" class="uri" title="wikilink">park</a>, but the land was instead used for athletic competitions. In 1890 he sold two lots at the corner of Sixth Street and Iron Street to <a href="Paul_E._Wirt" title="wikilink">Paul E. Wirt</a>, a <a href="fountain_pen" title="wikilink">fountain pen</a> manufacturer. Waller also hired the town engineer <a href="Samuel_Neyhard" title="wikilink">Samuel Neyhard</a> to <a href="housing_development" title="wikilink">develop</a> Bloomsburg from Fifth Street to the Susquehanna River. Most of this work was done after Waller was no longer a minister.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1869 Waller purchased 330 acres of land along <a href="Fishing_Creek_(North_Branch_Susquehanna_River)" title="wikilink">Fishing Creek</a> from the <a href="Bloomsburg_Iron_Company" title="wikilink">Bloomsburg Iron Company</a> and for $3000 and later sold it for $19,037. Waller sold some land in <a href="Mount_Pleasant_Township,_Columbia_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Mount Pleasant Township</a> for a place to house <a href="poverty" title="wikilink">poor</a> people. Waller gave some land Waller also made a number of a number of purchases of land near the end of his life. These included 93 acres at the confluence of Fishing Creek and Raven Creek in 1890 and 22.5 acres along the Susquehanna River in <a href="Scott_Township,_Columbia_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Scott Township</a> and Bloomsburg in May 1893.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1854 Waller and two other people were chosen to find a location for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg. This was partly Waller's land, so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 <a href="perch_(unit)" title="wikilink">perches</a> of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490. Waller was president of the company from 1856 to his death in 1893.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="work-in-industries">Work in industries</h2>
<p>Waller was also involved in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877 he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the <a href="Delaware,_Lackawanna_and_Western_Railroad" title="wikilink">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a> for the purpose of a new railroad station.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He was also involved in the construction of the <a href="North_and_West_Branch_Railway" title="wikilink">North and West Branch Railway</a> between 1880 and 1881.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the <a href="Panic_of_1873" title="wikilink">Panic of 1873</a> but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but Waller managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> on November 23, 1881 but remained its own company for approximately 20 years.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888 Waller sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the <a href="Bloomsburg_and_Sullivan_Railroad" title="wikilink">Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad</a> through it.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Waller also successfully convinced the <a href="Lackawanna_and_Bloomsburg_Railroad" title="wikilink">Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad</a> to move its Bloomsburg station to Waller's land on Market Street.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Waller was involved in the process of mining <a href="anthracite" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthracite</a> and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837 he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in <a href="Plymouth_Township,_Luzerne_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Plymouth Township</a> (now <a href="Larksville,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Larksville</a>) with his uncle, <a href="Oristus_Collins" title="wikilink">Oristus Collins</a>. Waller and Collins divided the land into their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878 Waller purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from <a href="Joseph_Jaquish" title="wikilink">Joseph Jaquish</a>'s heirs. Altogether Waller's coal-mining lands outputted 50,000 <a href="ton" title="wikilink">tons</a> (45,454 <a href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonnes</a>) per year, although this was only a small portion of the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister Waller also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near <a href="Chattanooga,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Chattanooga</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-endeavours">Other endeavours</h2>
<p>Waller began most of his industrial and commercial work shortly after retiring from being a minister in 1871.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1834 Waller went to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> to serve as a <a href="tutor" class="uri" title="wikilink">tutor</a>, but left after three or four weeks. This was the last time in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still made a number of contributions to the field of education.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In the same year, Waller made a successful attempt to open a <a href="classical_school" title="wikilink">classical school</a> in Bloomsburg. The school was built in 1839, and Waller contributed $3500 to it.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, Waller organized a <a href="singing" class="uri" title="wikilink">singing</a> school. He also created a <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> class in 1839 and the class continue until after his death.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Waller played a role in the opening of Bloomsburg's State Normal School.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Waller was appointed a trustee of <a href="Lafayette_College" title="wikilink">Lafayette College</a> in 1849 by the <a href="Synod_of_Philadelphia" title="wikilink">Synod of Philadelphia</a>. He held that position until 1879.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In 1856 Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute. He was one of the nine trustees who initially had that position.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However Waller resigned from this position in 1866, following a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, however, Waller still was involved in the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1876, Waller ran as a Republican candidate for <a href="US_Congress" title="wikilink">US Congress</a>. He lost the election by a large margin to <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> lawyer <a href="Francis_Dolan_Collins" title="wikilink">Francis Dolan Collins</a>. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He was also the proprietor of a furnace on <a href="Roaring_Creek_(Pennsylvania)" title="wikilink">Roaring Creek</a> and built the Bloomsburg <a href="Sanatorium" title="wikilink">Sanitarium</a> at the corner of Sixth Street and Market Street in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. Waller extended Market Street in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Along with John Ramsay, he also built First Street in Bloomsburg and sold the lots on it to <a href="Welsh_people" title="wikilink">Welsh</a> immigrants. This happened some time before 1847. He also laid out numerous other residential streets. Waller was a proponent of moving the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> of <a href="Columbia_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Columbia County</a> from <a href="Danville,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Danville</a> to Bloomsburg,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866 Waller was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>On May 23, 1839 Waller married <a href="Philadelphia" title="wikilink">Philadelphian</a> Julia Ellmaker. It is likely that Waller first met Ellmaker while visiting friends in <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> during his time at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The couple had nine children between 1840 and 1858,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> six of whom survived to adulthood<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> five of whom were alive in 1893.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Waller lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the <a href="Susquehanna_River" title="wikilink">Susquehanna River</a>, Railroad Street, and Ferry Road in Bloomsburg. In 1871 Waller suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and due to this, he needed to walk with crutches for the remainder of his life.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Waller also suffered from <a href="rheumatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">rheumatism</a> and <a href="neuralgia" class="uri" title="wikilink">neuralgia</a> due to extensive travelling.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Waller died in on December 7, 1893<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> at the age of 79.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The services for his death were held in his home.

Battle also made note of Waller's hospitality. Waller was interested in <a href="geology" class="uri" title="wikilink">geology</a> and for this reason another Presbyterian minister gave him a large <a href="mineralogy" class="uri" title="wikilink">mineralogy</a>-related collection in 1848.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
