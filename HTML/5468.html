<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Empire Hotel has long played a major role in Dunedin culture. Originally named <em>The Queen's Arms</em>, it was built on its present site in 1858, only 10 years after the founding of Dunedin. At that time, before much of the harbourside land was <a href="land_reclamation" title="wikilink">reclaimed</a>, its site near the city's main wharf made it a central gathering place providing accommodation, food, and drink. When the <a href="Otago_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Otago Gold Rush</a> broke, three years later, it became the central building in a thriving entertainment district. The current brick building, designed by Thomas Bedford Cameron,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> replaced the original structure in 1879, and was renamed the Empire Hotel in 1898.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The tavern became a pivotal venue for the development of Dunedin's distinctive music scene of the 1980s, known worldwide as the <a href="Dunedin_Sound" title="wikilink">Dunedin Sound</a>. Under the ownership of John and Maureen Simpson, the upstairs bar became a principal venue for performances by such bands as <a href="The_Chills" title="wikilink">The Chills</a>, <a href="The_Verlaines" title="wikilink">The Verlaines</a>, and <a href="The_Clean" title="wikilink">The Clean</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Even now, several years after the closure of the venue, the Empire is still regarded by many as the home of the Dunedin Sound:</p>

<h2 id="the-building">The building</h2>
<p>The Empire Hotel is part of a historic precinct containing numerous <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian_architecture" title="wikilink">Edwardian</a> buildings, several of which have NZHPT classification. Rising three storeys, it has a plain, plastered frontage with a metal fire escape. Two arched entrance doors stand at either end of the ground-level frontage. The hotel was originally built with more decoration on its fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, but much of this was removed during the late 20th century.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
