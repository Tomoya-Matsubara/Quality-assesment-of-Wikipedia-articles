<h2 id="cast-creation-and-influences">Cast creation and influences</h2>
<p><img src="Laguna_squall1.jpg" title="fig:Full motion video depictions of Laguna (left) and Squall, two of the main protagonists" alt="Full motion video depictions of Laguna (left) and Squall, two of the main protagonists" width="250" /> Scenario writer <a href="Kazushige_Nojima" title="wikilink">Kazushige Nojima</a> stresses the dynamic of players' relationships with the main character in <em>Final Fantasy</em> games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, protagonist <a href="Cloud_Strife" title="wikilink">Cloud Strife</a>'s reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This approach led to the inclusion of numerous instances of internal monologue, giving insight into what Squall thinks of other characters and recent developments.</p>
<p>Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director <a href="Yoshinori_Kitase" title="wikilink">Yoshinori Kitase</a> during the period between the development of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>, suggested that the game should have a &quot;school days&quot; feel. Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called &quot;Gardens&quot;, in which students would train to become &quot;SeeD&quot; mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game&lt;U+2014&gt;Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group of twenty years in the past&lt;U+2014&gt;to highly contrast with one another. Laguna's group consists of characters in their late twenties and have a lot of combat experience. They are also close friends who have fought together for a long time and trust one another. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Kitase expressed a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere (&quot;foreign&quot; being in relation to <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>); his objective with the environment was to create a largely <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> was Squall,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's <a href="full_motion_video" title="wikilink">full motion video</a> designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series as technology has advanced.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Guardian Forces&quot;, creatures who are brought into battle to attack enemies or support the party, are the version of summons appearing in <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>. Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to &quot;become the actual monsters&quot;, so he took great care in their design.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ramuh&lt;U+2014&gt;an old wizard from earlier <em>Final Fantasy</em> games&lt;U+2014&gt;was replaced; other human-like designs were re-imagined nude and with creature-like elements. Nomura, also the director of the Guardian Force animation sequences, wanted to create a greater impact than the summons of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Leviathan was created as a test and included in a <a href="game_demo" title="wikilink">game demo</a>. Garnering a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In a <em><a href="Famitsu" title="wikilink">Famitsu Weekly</a></em> interview with Kitase, Nomura, and Yuusuke Naoi, the team agreed that <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> reflects Nomura's preferred technique, as opposed to <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, which featured characters that &quot;weren't really his style&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The team also decided to use realistically proportioned characters. The higher level of full motion video technology would have otherwise created an inconsistency between the in-game graphics and the higher definition full motion video graphics. Additionally, Kitase explained that the main logo of the game&lt;U+2014&gt;Squall and Rinoa embracing&lt;U+2014&gt;was inspired by the team's efforts to express emotion through body language.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="creatures-and-races">Creatures and races</h2>

<p>The world of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> is predominantly occupied by humans. Another prominent race is the &quot;Shumi&quot;, a small tribe of creatures with yellow skin and large arms. The tribe lives in an underground village on the Trabian continent.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Shumi frown upon showing off their large hands; <a href="Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII#NORG" title="wikilink">NORG</a>, the owner of Balamb Garden, was exiled from the tribe for his ostentation. All Shumi undergo a biological <a href="metamorphosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">metamorphosis</a> at some point in their lives; a qualified Shumi will become an Elder while another may become a mute &quot;Moomba&quot;. Moombas are covered in red fur, which the Shumi attribute to &quot;the passionate ingenuity in their hearts&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Additionally, Moombas have appeared in several <em>Final Fantasy</em> spin-offs, including <em><a href="Chocobo_World" title="wikilink">Chocobo World</a></em> and <em><a href="Chocobo_Racing" title="wikilink">Chocobo Racing</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="Chocobo" title="wikilink">Chocobos</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;large <a href="galliform" class="uri" title="wikilink">galliform</a> birds common throughout the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series&lt;U+2014&gt;are featured in the game. In this title, Chocobos are generally undomesticated and can be found in various forests throughout the world. Each forest has a minigame where the player must corral baby Chocobos to locate the mother. If the player catches a bird, a baby Chocobo (a Chicobo) named Boko will follow the player around.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Boko has his own game called <em><a href="Minigames_of_Final_Fantasy#Chocobo_World" title="wikilink">Chocobo World</a></em> that can be downloaded from the <a href="PlayStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a> disc onto a <a href="PocketStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PocketStation</a> game unit.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Series composer <a href="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="wikilink">Nobuo Uematsu</a> created two Chocobo themes for <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>: &quot;Mods de Chocobo&quot; and &quot;Odeka de Chocobo&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> also features an array of common real world creatures, such as cats and dogs.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The game also includes <a href="Character_design_of_Final_Fantasy#Monsters" title="wikilink">numerous monsters</a>, many of which have appeared earlier in the series. Popular recurring monsters include Adamantoise, Behemoth, Bomb, Cactuar, Iron Giant, Malboro, and Tonberry.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="playable-characters">Playable characters</h2>
<h3 id="squall">Squall</h3>


<p>is the primary protagonist and a young student at Balamb Garden, identifiable by the scar on his face that a fellow student, <a href="#Seifer" title="wikilink">Seifer</a>, inflicted. He rarely speaks and has the reputation of being a <a href="lone_wolf_(trait)" title="wikilink">lone wolf</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> As Squall's story unfolds, he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing out in the rain at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where &quot;<a href="#Ellone" title="wikilink">Sis</a>&quot; went.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Squall's weapon is a <a href="pistol_sword" title="wikilink">gunblade</a>, a <a href="sword" class="uri" title="wikilink">sword</a> that uses components of a <a href="revolver" class="uri" title="wikilink">revolver</a> to send vibrations through the blade when triggered.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called <em>Renzokuken</em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rinoa">Rinoa</h3>

<p>is the primary female protagonist. She is the seventeen-year-old<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> daughter of <a href="#General_Caraway" title="wikilink">General Caraway</a>, a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and <a href="#Julia" title="wikilink">Julia Heartilly</a>, a successful pianist and singer. Rinoa is a member of the <a href="#Forest_Owls" title="wikilink">Forest Owls</a>, a resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation. When Squall and his party of SeeD help the resistance movement fight Galbadia, Rinoa decides to stay with them; as a result she ends up falling in love with Squall.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In battle, she uses a weapon called a &quot;Blaster Edge&quot;,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> which consists of an arm holster and a projectile that returns like a <a href="boomerang" class="uri" title="wikilink">boomerang</a>. In her <em>Combine</em> Limit Break, she attacks in unison with her dog, Angelo.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> When Rinoa gains Sorceress powers, she acquires a second Limit Break, <em>Angel Wing</em>, which increases her spell-casting ability, along with rendering her in a state of &quot;magic&quot; berserk for the remainder of the battle. <img src="FFVIIIgirls.jpg" title="fig:From left, Tetsuya Nomura&#39;s designs of Selphie, Rinoa, and Quistis" alt="From left, Tetsuya Nomura&#39;s designs of Selphie, Rinoa, and Quistis" width="220" /></p>
<p>When designing Rinoa, <a href="Tetsuya_Nomura" title="wikilink">Tetsuya Nomura</a> emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in <a href="full_motion_video" title="wikilink">full motion video</a> technology become the entire focus, believing that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters &quot;too beautiful&quot; and focus more on physical appearance than personality. With this concern in mind, Nomura set out with the intention to avoid making Rinoa gorgeous, and to simply make her &quot;<a href="cuteness" title="wikilink">cute</a>&quot; instead. To further emphasize this, he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa's character that he felt conveyed this idea of &quot;cute, not gorgeous&quot;, and sent them to Nojima along with the character's design.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Squall and Rinoa clearly develop a relationship, it is never explicit until the final cutscene. <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> criticized this, stating that &quot;considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens&lt;U+2014&gt;not to mention forming the central image of the box art&lt;U+2014&gt;it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <a href="Game_Revolution" title="wikilink">Game Revolution</a>, however, stated &quot;Frankly, you don't even have to play the game to know that love will win out in some way... very 'Hollywood.' But it is the way in which they tell the story that sets it apart from being just some teen-angst drama&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In terms of Rinoa herself, when the Game Revolution reviewer cited the wish that the game had <a href="voice_acting" title="wikilink">voice acting</a>, he specifically mentioned Rinoa, stating &quot;there is something sorely missing when I can't hear Rinoa talk&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> She is also the subject of numerous fansites, as well as an 8.0 rating on WomenGamers.com.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="GamesRadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">GamesRadar</a> wrote an article about the top seven lazy character cliches, using Rinoa amongst others as an example of the &quot;pure hearted love interest.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> They again mentioned her, including her in an article of characters who are hot in their art and in cutscenes but ugly in their in-game graphics. In the cutscenes, they describe Rinoa as lovable and pretty while wearing a dress a normal person would wear, her in-game appearance was nowhere near as attractive.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="laguna">Laguna</h3>

<p>is a man whose past and relation to the main characters are revealed slowly throughout the game. Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear in the form of &quot;dreams&quot; experienced by the protagonists. Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna's point of view, although he does not think too highly of Laguna.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Laguna attacks with a machine gun and his Limit Break is <em>Desperado</em>,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> which involves a swinging rope, a grenade, and a lot of bullets. During the dream segments, he is a twenty-seven-year-old soldier in the Galbadian army who travels with his companions, <a href="#Kiros" title="wikilink">Kiros Seagill</a> and <a href="#Ward" title="wikilink">Ward Zabac</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He is also an aspiring journalist whose real weapon of choice is writing.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>During the first two dream segments, Laguna and his team are shown getting lost and visiting the hotel where singer <a href="#Julia" title="wikilink">Julia Heartilly</a>, Laguna's romantic interest, performs.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> After a scouting mission at Centra, the three soldiers are separated and Laguna is injured. A young woman named <a href="#Raine" title="wikilink">Raine</a> takes him to Winhill where he is nursed back to health.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He falls in love with and marries her. However, he is drawn away from his new home when a young girl in their care, Ellone, is kidnapped. Laguna tracks her down in Esthar, where he helps liberate the nation from the despotic rule of <a href="#Adel" title="wikilink">Sorceress Adel</a>. The people of Esthar elect Laguna as their president and Ellone is sent back to Winhill without him.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> After Raine dies, her child (whom Ward and Kiros imply to be Squall in a conversation aboard the Ragnarok) and Ellone are sent to an orphanage.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Laguna is unable to leave his post to visit her and remains president of Esthar to present day.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Ellone and Laguna are reunited in space,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and Laguna helps the party prepare for their fight against <a href="#Ultimecia" title="wikilink">Ultimecia</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of two main characters was planned since the beginning of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted charisma, and Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Laguna is ranked seventh in <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em>'s list of the top ten video game politicians.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Laguna Loire is set to appear in <em><a href="Dissidia_012_Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a></em>, where he will be voiced by <a href="Hiroaki_Hirata" title="wikilink">Hiroaki Hirata</a> in the Japanese version.</p>
<h3 id="seifer">Seifer</h3>

<p>is a classmate and rival of Squall, who can only be controlled by the player during the Dollet sequence. He reappears as a <a href="Boss_(video_games)" title="wikilink">boss</a> later in the game. He acts as a <a href="foil_(literature)" title="wikilink">foil</a> to Squall in many respects, having dated Rinoa before she met Squall,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and assuming a leadership position among his friends.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Like Squall, Seifer wields a gunblade which he calls &quot;<a href="Hyperion_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Hyperion</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> His Limit Break, <em>Fire Cross</em>, allows him to use an attack called <em>No Mercy</em>. He later uses the more powerful techniques <em>Demon Slice</em> and <em>Bloodfest</em> against the player. Seifer has a short temper and is often depicted as a bully who desires attention.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He is also fiercely independent and is often punished for his recklessness.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He is the leader of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with his friends <a href="#Fujin" title="wikilink">Fujin</a> and <a href="#Raijin" title="wikilink">Raijin</a>. After joining Ultimecia, he becomes the leader of the Galbadian army.</p>
<p>During the introduction sequence, Seifer cuts Squall across the left side of his face with his gunblade, leaving a scar. Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and <a href="#Zell" title="wikilink">Zell</a>, abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he <a href="defection" title="wikilink">defects</a> to <a href="#Edea" title="wikilink">Sorceress Edea</a> so he could be her &quot;knight&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> From his point of view, Squall and the others are &quot;evil&quot; and he recognizes himself as a hero.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends. Eventually, Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Ironically Seifer's dream of being a knight, and subsequent combat style, was inspired by the B-Movie starring Squall's alleged father Laguna Loire (again in contrast to Squall's distaste for his 'father'). At the end of the game, Seifer is seen fishing and having fun with Fujin and Raijin again.</p>
<p>Nomura had originally intended Seifer not only as Squall's rival, but also as part of the <a href="love_triangle" title="wikilink">love triangle</a> between him, Squall, and Rinoa. Although this concept was not thoroughly explored in the final script, Seifer remains Squall's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall's. They have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces and their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters use gunblades; Squall's gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts_II" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> as a member of the Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin. Seifer in the virtual Twilight Town is a rival of the main character, Roxas, and at one point mentions that he does not wish to cooperate with destiny.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In the English version, he is voiced by <a href="Will_Friedle" title="wikilink">Will Friedle</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The book &quot;Converging Traditions in the Digital Moving Image: Architectures of Illusion, Images of Truth&quot; discusses that while Seifer is seen as a show-off and a troublemaker, protagonist <a href="Squall_Leonhart" title="wikilink">Squall Leonhart</a> identifies with him.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> listed Seifer as the 91st best video game villain, stating that he makes for a great rival due to the similarities between him and Squall.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="quistis">Quistis</h3>

<p>is an eighteen-year-old instructor at Balamb Garden, where Squall, Zell, and Seifer are students.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> She uses a <a href="chain_whip" title="wikilink">chain whip</a> in battle,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> and her Limit Break, <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_character_classes#Blue_Mage" title="wikilink">Blue Magic</a></em>, a common ability found throughout the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, allows her to imitate monsters' attacks.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Early in the game, Quistis is discharged as an instructor because she &quot;[lacks] leadership qualities&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Afterwards, she maintains a more informal relationship with the other characters as a fellow member of SeeD.</p>
<p>As a child, Quistis stayed at an orphanage with most of the main characters. She then lived with <a href="foster_care" title="wikilink">foster parents</a>, with whom she never developed any intimacy, before moving to Galbadia Garden <a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> at age ten.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> As a result, Squall stops paying attention to her, which leads to Quistis asking if he is paying attention. Squall rudely tells her to go &quot;talk to a wall&quot;, a famous comical line in the game, and not to burden him with her problems. This furthers the player's perception of Squall's awkwardness and anti-social tendencies. When Irvine refreshes the main characters' memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall's asocial behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>When designing the characters, Nomura had wanted at least one female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around the same age as the rest of the group.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="selphie">Selphie</h3>

<p>is a student at Balamb Garden who recently transferred from Trabia Garden. She is active and energetic, although slightly clumsy.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> She participates in many extracurricular activities, such as planning the Garden Festival<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and running the school's website. She wields <a href="nunchaku" class="uri" title="wikilink">nunchaku</a> in battle,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> and her Limit Break <em>Slot</em> allows the player to cast a random spell numerous times as well as certain magic used exclusively in her limit break.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> In addition to battle, she pilots the Ragnarok starship.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Selphie first appears when running into Squall while late for class. She asks Squall to show her around because she recently transferred. During the Dollet exam, Selphie joins Squall's team after Seifer abandons them.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> She becomes a SeeD with Squall and Zell, and the three are assigned to the same team. When Galbadia launches missiles at Trabia Garden, she reacts with outrage and helps destroy the missile base.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Throughout the game, she revisits her childhood closeness with Irvine,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> who serves as her copilot on the Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Selphie was the second character that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized that none of the characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In the <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts_(series)" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of <a href="Universe_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Destiny_Islands" title="wikilink">Destiny Islands</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> This Selphie uses a <a href="jump_rope" title="wikilink">jump rope</a> instead of <a href="nunchaku" class="uri" title="wikilink">nunchaku</a> and is voiced by <a href="Molly_Keck" title="wikilink">Molly Keck</a> in the English release.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="zell">Zell</h3>

<p>is a student at Balamb Garden with Squall and Seifer. Seventeen years old,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Zell is a <a href="martial_arts" title="wikilink">martial artist</a> who fits the role of unarmed character, just like <a href="Tifa_Lockhart" title="wikilink">Tifa Lockhart</a> did in the previous game, <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. Zell attacks with punches and kicks, his weapons being gloves,<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and his Limit Break, <em>Duel</em>, requires the player to input button combinations on the controller to deal damage.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Zell is slightly impulsive and overconfident in his own skill; however, he is loyal to his friends.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Seifer gives him the nickname &quot;<em>chicken-wuss</em>&quot; and other characters begin using it as well.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He also has a passion for <a href="hot_dog" title="wikilink">hot dogs</a>; a recurring gag is that they are always sold out by the time he reaches the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Zell lived at the same orphanage as many of the other protagonists; this is where Seifer first began to bully him. He was later adopted by the Dincht family in the town of Balamb.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> His motivation for enrolling at Garden is to live up to the memory of his grandfather, a famous soldier.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> It is also implied that Zell suffers from heavy <a href="ADHD" class="uri" title="wikilink">ADHD</a>.</p>
<p>Zell was designed to look and act like the main character of a <a href="sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen" class="uri" title="wikilink">sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen</a> <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> (Japanese <a href="comic_book" title="wikilink">comic books</a> intended primarily for boys);<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> his neighbors in Balamb describe him as a &quot;'comic-bookish' type of hero&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He also thinks of himself as Seifer's rival, despite not being the main character.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The inspiration for the tattoo on his face came from an <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a> that featured a man with a <a href="full_body_tattoo" title="wikilink">full body tattoo</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Zell's ultimate weapon is named <em><a href="Ehrgeiz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ehrgeiz</a></em>, directly referencing the game of the same name which came out around the same time <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> did. Also, continuing the similarities to <a href="Tifa_Lockhart" title="wikilink">Tifa Lockhart</a> of <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Zell's final limit break is <em>My Final Heaven</em>, while Tifa's was called just <em>Final Heaven</em>.</p>
<h3 id="irvine">Irvine</h3>

<p>is a student at Galbadia Garden, one of the three mercenary academies in the game. He is one of the Garden's elite sharpshooters,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> always carrying his rifle.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> His Limit Break is <em>Shot</em>, which deals damage and inflicts <a href="status_effect" title="wikilink">status effects</a> depending on the type of ammunition.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Irvine is depicted as a <a href="cowboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">cowboy</a>, tall and fair-skinned with long brown hair that he wears pulled back in a ponytail.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> He also enjoys <a href="flirting" class="uri" title="wikilink">flirting</a> with the female characters,<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> He acts like a carefree, but misunderstood loner;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> however, this is merely a fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sorceress Edea becomes the Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is introduced as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall that he always chokes under pressure.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he and most of the other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_classes#Summoner" title="wikilink">Guardian Forces</a> (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>With Irvine, Nomura tried to strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not becoming too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="kiros">Kiros</h3>

<p>is one of Laguna's comrades in the Galbadian Army. He fights with <a href="Katara_(sword)" title="wikilink">Kataras</a> (&lt;U+0915&gt;&lt;U+091F&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+0930&gt;) (dual blades), with which he repeatedly slices his enemies in his Limit Break, <em>Blood Pain</em>. His weapons' name is given as &quot;katal&quot; in the English localization of the game. Following the failed mission in Centra, Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward. He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army, but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement. His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> When Laguna is forced to leave Winhill to find Ellone, Kiros accompanies him, helping him earn money as an amateur actor to fund the expedition.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Kiros remains by Laguna's side throughout his adventures in Esthar, earning a place as Laguna's advisor when he becomes president.

<h3 id="ward">Ward</h3>

<p>is Laguna's other comrade. An imposing man, he wields a large harpoon in battle; in his Limit Break, <em>Massive Anchor</em>, he uses it to crush his opponents from above. During the incident at Centra, he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> After being separated from Laguna and Kiros, he becomes a janitor at the D-District Prison. When Laguna becomes president of Esthar, Ward joins Kiros as an advisor, directing affairs with gestures and <a href="ellipsis" title="wikilink">ellipses</a>.

This Limit Break is depicted in a cutscene during Edea's coronation as head of Galbadia, when she (possessed by Ultimecia) attacks Squall with it.</p>
<p>Edea is one of three character concepts, along with <a href="#Fujin" title="wikilink">Fujin</a> and <a href="#Raijin" title="wikilink">Raijin</a>, to have been created before <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VIII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>. <a href="Tetsuya_Nomura" title="wikilink">Tetsuya Nomura</a> had designed Edea even before the development of <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, based on the style of <a href="Yoshitaka_Amano" title="wikilink">Yoshitaka Amano</a>, who was the character illustrator of <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VI" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> and previous games.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In the upcoming <em><a href="Dissidia_012_Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a></em>, Edea's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's.</p>

<h3 id="adel">Adel</h3>

<p>is a sorceress from Esthar who initiated the Sorceress War some years ago before the start of the game. As the ruler of Esthar, she ordered her soldiers to abduct every girl to find a suitable successor for her powers, including the young <a href="#Ellone" title="wikilink">Ellone</a>.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> During the Esthar revolution, <a href="#Laguna" title="wikilink">Laguna</a> and <a href="#Dr._Odine" title="wikilink">Dr. Odine</a> devised an artifact to cancel the sorceress power, and placed her in <a href="suspended_animation" title="wikilink">suspended animation</a> in outer space.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> In the present, after <a href="#Edea" title="wikilink">Edea</a> is released from <a href="#Ultimecia" title="wikilink">Ultimecia's</a> control, Ultimecia possesses the new sorceress, <a href="#Rinoa" title="wikilink">Rinoa</a>, and commands her to free Adel, so she can become Ultimecia's new and more powerful vessel.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Adel is successfully freed, so Rinoa is discarded as a host. However, in order to defeat Ultimecia, Dr. Odine plans for Ultimecia to once again possess Rinoa. Eventually, <a href="#Squall" title="wikilink">Squall's</a> party defeats Adel when she tries to absorb Rinoa at the Lunatic Pandora, thus Adel's powers transfer to Rinoa,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Ultimecia possesses her again, and using Ellone's powers, they start &quot;Time Compression&quot;, which leads to the final battle.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cid">Cid</h3>


<p>is the headmaster of Balamb Garden. After the failed assassination attempt on Edea, the Garden Master, <a href="#NORG" title="wikilink">NORG</a>, attempts to seize power from Cid and reconcile with Edea.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> This sparks an internal conflict, in which the students and personnel side with either Cid or NORG.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> However, Squall and <a href="#Minor_SeeD_members" title="wikilink">Xu</a> quell the conflict and return Cid to power. Afterward, Cid aggressively confronts NORG, who started the conflict over financial issues.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Cid is the husband of Sorceress Edea, with whom he ran an orphanage and founded the SeeD organization. They are estranged for most of the game, however, because they lead opposing factions until Ultimecia releases her magical possession of Edea.</p>
<p>Because most <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles include a character named &quot;Cid&quot;, Nomura wanted to design someone with differences from the past Cids in the series. He gave this version of Cid the appearance and personality of an older, benevolent character who would watch over Squall's party and offer them advice and motivation. Nojima decided that this type of good-natured character would work best as the headmaster of Balamb Garden.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="ellone">Ellone</h3>

She uses this talent to send Squall's party into <a href="#Laguna" title="wikilink">Laguna's</a> past adventures, hoping that they would alter the past; however, she eventually realizes that her abilities can only view history, not alter it.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> <a href="#Ultimecia" title="wikilink">Ultimecia</a> needs this power to achieve &quot;Time Compression&quot;, so she uses <a href="#Edea" title="wikilink">Edea</a> and the Galbadian military to find her.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Ellone is an important character in the story, tying the relationships between some of the characters, and being the primary objective of Ultimecia. However, Ellone's importance is mostly told in the flashbacks, and explained gradually. After Ellone's parents were killed by Esthar soldiers, under orders of <a href="#Adel" title="wikilink">sorceress Adel</a>, she lived with <a href="#Raine" title="wikilink">Raine</a> in the small Winhill <a href="village" class="uri" title="wikilink">village</a>, where she also developed a close relationship with her adoptive uncle, <a href="#Laguna" title="wikilink">Laguna</a>. These peaceful times lasted until she was finally captured by Esthar.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Then, Laguna travelled to Esthar to rescue her, at the same time he participated in Esthar's rebellion to overthrow Adel. After Adel's incarceration in space, Laguna having to remain in Esthar as <a href="president" class="uri" title="wikilink">president</a>, and then Raine's death, Ellone moved to <a href="#Cid" title="wikilink">Cid</a> and <a href="#Edea" title="wikilink">Edea's</a> <a href="orphanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">orphanage</a>, where she became an older sister figure to Squall and the other orphans, and eventually she also followed Cid to Balamb Garden. Early in the game, Squall's party finds Ellone in the <a href="library" class="uri" title="wikilink">library</a> of Balamb Garden, but the characters don't have further interactions. It is later explained that the &quot;Guardian Forces&quot; (GF) which the SeeDs use in battle cause <a href="memory_loss" title="wikilink">memory loss</a>, thus explaining why Squall doesn't remember Ellone, Edea and his past in the orphanage.</p>

<p>is a young woman with pale skin, short silver hair and an eye patch. She is a member of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Raijin; the three of them form a close &quot;posse&quot;,<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> even when Seifer leaves Garden. Fujin prefers to speak in terse sentences, often with only a single word, such as &quot;RAGE!&quot; and &quot;LIES!&quot; (in the Japanese version she only spoke in <a href="Kanji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kanji</a>). However, near the end of the game, she explains to Squall that she will temporarily break ties with Seifer because of his recent behavior.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> In battle, Fujin wields a <a href="chakram" class="uri" title="wikilink">chakram</a> and uses wind-based magic.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The characters of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> have received praise by reviewers. The <em>Gaming Age</em> reviewer was originally concerned with the shift to consistently realistically proportioned characters, but he ultimately found them more appealing.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Moreover, the review stated that the character designs and graphical quality allowed the characters to &quot;convey emotions much more dramatically&quot;.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> <em>Game Revolution</em> cited similar praise, agreeing that the change &quot;really makes the graphics impressive&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Jeff Lundigran of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> commented that the &quot;low-polygon characters of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only look better the closer they get&quot;.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> agreed with the transition, claiming that &quot;involving, personal, and emotional stories are far more believable when they come from, well, people, not short, bizarrely shaped cartoon characters&quot;.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>The cast itself has received criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized the manner in which romantic interactions play out, stating that &quot;considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens&lt;U+2014&gt;not to mention forming the central image of the box art&lt;U+2014&gt;it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever&quot;.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> With Squall, he felt that &quot;FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill&quot;.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> However, <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> felt that <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> shifts the story from the &quot;epic&quot; concepts of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> to the &quot;personal&quot;, in that &quot;the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny&quot;.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves &quot;one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication&quot;.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Although the reviewer at <em><a href="Official_U.S._PlayStation_Magazine" title="wikilink">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a></em> acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that &quot;it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced&quot;.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>

I don't know if his aspirations as a journalist are going to come true... Every time I try to have a serious converation, he avoids it... I can't stand his snoring and he talks in his sleep...&quot; (<em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>)<a href="#fnref175" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn181"><strong>Headmaster Cid:</strong> &quot;He is from the Shumi tribe. A black sheep of the tribe, one might say. We met while I was running around trying to find funds to build the Garden. He became interested in building the Garden, and we hit it off. Thanks to his funding, it was completed. However, we needed an enormous amount of funds to run the Garden. So we began dispatching SeeDs around the world as a means of supporting the Garden. NORG's idea was right on the money. An enormous amount of capital began flowing into the Garden. And the Garden began to change. Lost sight of our high ideals, the truth was covered up... That's probably enough. In the end, it was my fault, for giving up control.&quot; (<em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>)<a href="#fnref181" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
