<p>The University has its origins in seven previously independent <a href="art" class="uri" title="wikilink">art</a>, <a href="design" class="uri" title="wikilink">design</a>, <a href="fashion" class="uri" title="wikilink">fashion</a> and <a href="media_studies" title="wikilink">media</a> colleges, which were brought together for administrative purposes to form the <strong>London Institute</strong> in 1986.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> They were: <a href="Saint_Martin&#39;s_School_of_Art" title="wikilink">Saint Martin's School of Art</a>; <a href="Chelsea_College_of_Art_and_Design#Chelsea_School_of_Art" title="wikilink">Chelsea School of Art</a>; the <a href="London_College_of_Printing" title="wikilink">London College of Printing</a>; the <a href="Central_School_of_Art_and_Design" title="wikilink">Central School of Art and Design</a>; <a href="Camberwell_College_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts</a>; the <a href="College_for_Distributive_Trades" title="wikilink">College for Distributive Trades</a>; and the <a href="London_College_of_Fashion" title="wikilink">London College of Fashion</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The colleges were originally established from the mid 19th century to the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="Education_Reform_Act_1988" title="wikilink">Education Reform Act 1988</a>, the London Institute became a single legal entity, and the first court of governors were instated the following year in 1989. The first appointed <a href="Rector_(academia)" title="wikilink">Rector</a> was John McKenzie. The London Institute was incorporated as a <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> body in 1991 and was later granted <a href="academic_degree" title="wikilink">academic degree</a> awarding powers in 1993 by the <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a>. <a href="Will_Wyatt" title="wikilink">Will Wyatt</a> was appointed Chairman of Governors during the same year.

<p>On the retirement of Sir William Stubbs, Sir <a href="Michael_Bichard" title="wikilink">Michael Bichard</a> was appointed as Rector in 2001 and encouraged the London Institute to apply for University status. The London Institute originally chose not to apply because its individual colleges were internationally recognised in their own right.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 2003, the London Institute received Privy Council approval for university status and was renamed <strong>University of the Arts London</strong> in 2004.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Wimbledon School of Art joined the university as a sixth college in 2006, and was renamed <a href="Wimbledon_College_of_Art" title="wikilink">Wimbledon College of Art</a>.

<p>UAL's current research projects include:</p>
<p><strong>Catalytic clothing</strong> - a fashion-science partnership between Helen Storey (London College of Fashion) and Tony Ryan (University of Sheffield) to harness the pollution-busting properties of titanium dioxide to create clothes that cleanse the air. The researchers are working with Ecover to develop a laundry additive that enables the oxide, which naturally reacts with light and air to break down pollutants, to grip onto fibres in materials.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Mapping Web Application</strong> - a collaboration between Amanda Windle (London College of Communication), Microsoft Research Ltd and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to improve the accuracy and usability of the IUCN's Red List of species at risk. The new application will allow researchers and conservationists to see threats to species and actions taken to protect them in a dynamic way, live on a global map, and ebable them to edit, add and research new data as it is generated.</p>
<p><strong>TED's ten</strong> - the Textiles Environmental Design group has created a toolkit of design rules - TED's ten - that tackle fashion's often inconsistent approach to sustainability. The strategies for fashion and textile designers promote approaches that build reuse and recycling into the design process and eradicate waste. The group is testing the strategies as part of the Swedish government-funded Future Fashion consortium, which is developing a new fibre called CelluNova using wood from pine trees.</p>
<p>The university's research outputs, many of them free to download, can also be found in the university's institutional research repository.

<h3 id="students-union">Students' Union</h3>
<p>SUArts is based at UAL's High Holborn HQ with representatives and activities at all Colleges. It lobbies and campaigns on issues important to creative students, including campaigning against unpaid interships. Clubs and societies cover sports, nationality, politics and identity, and hobbies and interests from dance, drama and fashion to chess, knitting and food.</p>
<h3 id="student-hub">Student Hub</h3>
<p>The Student Hub is the central university office at <a href="High_Holborn" title="wikilink">High Holborn</a>, which is used for administrative purposes, learning resources, support services and a students' union cafe/bar. The Hub includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Learning Zone</strong> - a space for collaborative and private study; facilities include computers, laptop hire and rooms for presentations/rehearsals;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>International Centre</strong> - manages international student recruitment and its network of local representatives based across the world. The centre and the local representatives offer specialist advice, such as course information and University services, as well as advice on immigration and fees; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Language Centre</strong> - enables prospective students to study <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> and other modern languages, before and during their course.</li>

<h3 id="publications">Publications</h3>
<p>The Student Union publishes <em>Less Common More Sense</em>, a magazine that serves to showcase student work from all six colleges. The University also publishes <em>Arts London News</em>, a weekly newspaper distributed throughout three terms of the year, which is produced, managed and edited during term time by Journalism and Photojournalism students at the London College of Communication. The paper is published in conjunction with <a href="News_International" title="wikilink">News International</a>.</p>
<h3 id="student-enterprise-and-employability-service">Student Enterprise and Employability service</h3>
<p>Creative graduates typically have less clearly defined career paths than those of other disciplines. They are highly entrepreneurial &lt;U+2013&gt; 18% of UAL graduates are self-employed three years after graduating compared to the national average of 5% - and tend to pursue flexible and varied &lt;U+2018&gt;portfolio&lt;U+2019&gt; careers, made up of self-employment, part-time and short-term contracts, freelancing, and creative practice.</p>
<p>To make sure that students and graduates are prepared for the careers they will enter and that basic career skills and knowledge are built into the University&lt;U+2019&gt;s curricula right from the start, UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s Student Enterprise and Employability service was set up in September 2011.&lt;U+00A0&gt;The service provides advice, mentoring, events and surgeries focused on the basic skills that creative graduates need &lt;U+2013&gt; effective networking, business planning, pitching, presenting and marketing &lt;U+2013&gt; as well as more technical skills for successful entrepreneurship, including protecting your intellectual property,understanding legal contracts, accessing start-up funding, plus taking advantage of new models for business success, such as crowd funding and selling online.</p>
<p>SEE is a delivery partner for the Government&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em><a href="Start_Up_Loans_Scheme" title="wikilink">Start Up Loans Scheme</a></em>, offers annual Creative Enterprise Awards for graduates and provides grants for early-stage businesses through its SEED Fund.&lt;U+00A0&gt;The service also offers relevant paid employment through ArtsTemps, UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s in-house temp agency set up to help students and recent graduates develop employment skills as well as earn. ArtsTemps is the preferred supplier of temp staff across the University, and has now paid out over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million in salaries.</p>
<p>SEE also helps students and graduates to find work placements and paid internships in organisations and businesses throughout the creative sector.&lt;U+00A0&gt;</p>
<p>SEE&lt;U+2019&gt;s third main focus is on supporting artists and craftspeople to develop their practice. It supports Artquest, a service providing practical peer support and networking to develop their ability to make, sell and find work. It has also set up Showroom &lt;U+2013&gt; a high profile shop and gallery at the front of UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s Central London HQ that displays and sells work by UAL students and graduates.</p>
<h3 id="student-housing">Student housing</h3>
