It has been dated to between 30 thousand to 50 thousand years old.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The skull is that of an adult woman, with typical Neanderthal features.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While the skull was one of the first to be found, it was also possibly from one of the last surviving Neanderthal populations.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Being found more than ten years before the publication of <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>'s <a href="Origin_of_Species" title="wikilink">Origin of Species</a> however, the significance of the find was not understood at the time, and the skull simply labelled as &quot;an ancient human&quot;.
