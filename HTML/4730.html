<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Dodge was born at <a href="Bedford_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Liberty, Virginia</a> in the Piedmont near Lynchburg. In 1879, his mother, Mary de Leftwich Dodge, an aspiring artist, moved her family to Europe. After living initially in Munich they moved to Paris, where she worked on art. Dodge later followed her example and became an artist. He spent most of his childhood years in France, where his mother was working on art. He studied at the <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;cole_des_Beaux_Arts" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;cole des Beaux Arts</a> and took first place in the examinations in 1881. He also studied under <a href="Jean-L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on_G&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00F4&gt;me" title="wikilink">Jean-L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on G&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00F4&gt;me</a> and with <a href="Rapha&lt;U+00EB&gt;l_Collin" title="wikilink">Rapha&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Collin</a> at the <a href="Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie_Colarossi" title="wikilink">Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie Colarossi</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and traveled to <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> for studies there.</p>

<p>Dodge received early commissions that gained him attention in the United States, first at the <a href="Columbian_Exposition_of_1893" title="wikilink">Columbian Exposition of 1893</a> in Chicago. He was living in Paris when he applied for commissions for mural works for the <a href="Library_of_Congress" title="wikilink">Library of Congress</a>, which he completed in 1895. This work enabled him to marry Francesca (Fanny) Theodora Bland Pryor, daughter of <a href="Sara_Agnes_Rice_Pryor" title="wikilink">Sara Agnes Rice Pryor</a> and <a href="Roger_Atkinson_Pryor" title="wikilink">Roger Atkinson Pryor</a> of Virginia and New York. Her mother was a civic activist and author who published several books in the early 1900s; her father was an attorney and became a justice on the New York State Supreme Court.</p>

<p>After he and his family settled in New York, Dodge taught at the <a href="Art_Students_League_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Art Students League of New York</a> and at <a href="Cooper_Union" title="wikilink">Cooper Union</a>.</p>
<p>He became known as a muralist when the genre was at a peak of popularity, commissioned for major public buildings as well as hotels and mansions. Murals were seen as a kind of art that could reach directly to the people. Dodge drew on a variety of styles for his murals, settling on a heroic, neoclassical look. Achieving success with commissions for his murals, in 1906 Dodge designed the classical <em>Villa Francesca,</em> named after his wife, as their family home in <a href="Setauket-East_Setauket,_New_York" title="wikilink">Setauket, Long Island</a>.</p>
<p>In his private work, Dodge's paintings show the influence of <a href="Impressionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Impressionism</a> and <a href="Fauvism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fauvism</a>. Toward the end of his career, Dodge became interested in <a href="Maya_civilization" title="wikilink">Mayan</a> art. His work is held in the permanent collections of the <a href="Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="National_Academy_of_Design" title="wikilink">National Academy of Design</a>.</p>
