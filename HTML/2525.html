<p><strong>Dennis Keith Rodman</strong> (born May 13, 1961) is a retired <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> professional <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player of the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a>'s (NBA) <a href="Detroit_Pistons" title="wikilink">Detroit Pistons</a>, <a href="San_Antonio_Spurs" title="wikilink">San Antonio Spurs</a>, <a href="Chicago_Bulls" title="wikilink">Chicago Bulls</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a> and <a href="Dallas_Mavericks" title="wikilink">Dallas Mavericks</a>. Born in <a href="Trenton,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, he was nicknamed &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and &quot;Worm&quot; and was known for his fierce <a href="Defense_(sports)" title="wikilink">defensive</a> and <a href="rebound_(basketball)" title="wikilink">rebounding</a> abilities. Playing <a href="small_forward" title="wikilink">small forward</a> in his early years before becoming a <a href="Power_forward_(basketball)" title="wikilink">power forward</a>, Rodman earned <a href="NBA_All-Defensive_Team" title="wikilink">NBA All-Defensive First Team</a> honors seven times and was voted <a href="NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a> twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships (1989, 1990, 1996, 1997, 1998). His biography at NBA.com states that he is &quot;arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history&quot;.</p>
<p>Experiencing an unhappy childhood, Rodman was shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as the prototypical &quot;bad boy&quot; and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He dyed his hair in artificial colors, presented himself with many <a href="Body_piercing" title="wikilink">piercings</a> and <a href="tattoo" title="wikilink">tattoos</a> and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a <a href="wedding_dress" title="wikilink">wedding dress</a> to promote his <a href="autobiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">autobiography</a>. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a> and was briefly married to actress <a href="Carmen_Electra" title="wikilink">Carmen Electra</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from basketball, Rodman is a part-time <a href="professional_wrestler" title="wikilink">professional wrestler</a>. He was a member of the <a href="New_World_Order_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">nWo</a> and fought alongside <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a> at two <em><a href="Bash_at_the_Beach" title="wikilink">Bash at the Beach</a></em> events. He had his own TV show, <em><a href="The_Rodman_World_Tour" title="wikilink">The Rodman World Tour</a></em>, and had lead roles in the action films <em><a href="Simon_Sez" title="wikilink">Simon Sez</a></em> and <em><a href="Double_Team_(film)" title="wikilink">Double Team</a></em> alongside <a href="Jean-Claude_Van_Damme" title="wikilink">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>. Both films were severely critically panned, with the latter earning Rodman a triple <a href="Razzie_Award" title="wikilink">Razzie Award</a>. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of <em><a href="The_Mole_(U.S._Season_4)" title="wikilink">Celebrity Mole</a></em>. Rodman also won the first ever <a href="Hulk_Hogan&#39;s_Celebrity_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">Celebrity Championship Wrestling</a> tournament.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Dennis Rodman was born in <a href="Trenton,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Trenton</a>, <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman Jr., an <a href="Air_force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> pilot and veteran of the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>. When he was three, his father deserted his family and went on to eventually father 27 children with four different women.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Shirley subsequently took many odd jobs&lt;U+2014&gt;at times, four at the same time&lt;U+2014&gt;to support her family.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In his 1997 biography <em><a href="Bad_As_I_Wanna_Be" title="wikilink">Bad As I Wanna Be</a></em>, he expresses his disgust for his father: &quot;I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I just look at it like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The impoverished Rodman and his two sisters, Debra and Kim,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> grew up in the <a href="Oak_Cliff" title="wikilink">Oak Cliff</a> section of <a href="Dallas" title="wikilink">Dallas, Texas</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> considered one of the worst areas of Dallas in those times,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Rodman was so attached to his mother that he refused to move when she sent him to a <a href="nursery_school" title="wikilink">nursery</a> when he was four years old. According to Rodman, Shirley Rodman was more interested in his two sisters Debra and Kim, who were both considered more talented than him in basketball, and made him a laughingstock whenever he tagged along with them. He felt generally &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the all-female household.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Debra and Kim would go on to become <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-Americans</a> at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F. Austin respectively.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When Rodman experienced his growth spurt, he became even more withdrawn because he felt odd in his own body.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Rodman was so insecure around women that he thought he was <a href="Homosexuality" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> in his teens, was still a <a href="virgin" class="uri" title="wikilink">virgin</a> when he was 20 years old, and eventually had his first sexual experience with a <a href="prostitute" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitute</a>; he described this as an unpleasant experience.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>While attending <a href="South_Oak_Cliff_High_School" title="wikilink">South Oak Cliff High School</a>, Rodman played under future <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M</a> coach <a href="Gary_Blair" title="wikilink">Gary Blair</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, Rodman was not considered an athletic standout. According to himself, he was &quot;unable to hit a <a href="layup" class="uri" title="wikilink">layup</a>&quot; and was listed in the high school basketball teams, but was either benched or cut from the squads. Measuring only  as a freshman in high school,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> he also failed to make the football teams and was &quot;totally devastated&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> After finishing school, Rodman worked as an overnight janitor at <a href="Dallas/Fort_Worth_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Dallas Fort Worth International Airport</a>. He experienced a sudden growth spurt, and decided to give basketball another shot.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>A family friend tipped off the head coach of <a href="North_Central_Texas_College" title="wikilink">Cooke County College</a> in <a href="Gainesville,_Texas" title="wikilink">Gainesville, Texas</a>. In his single semester there, he averaged 17.6  points and 13.3 rebounds, before flunking out due to poor academic performances.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> After his short stint in Gainesville, he transferred to <a href="Southeastern_Oklahoma_State_University" title="wikilink">Southeastern Oklahoma State University</a>, an <a href="National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics" title="wikilink">NAIA</a> school. There, Rodman was a three-time NAIA <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-American</a> and led the NAIA in rebounding in both the 1984&lt;U+2013&gt;85 and 1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86 seasons. In three seasons there, 1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84 through 1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86, he averaged 25.7 points and 15.7 rebounds, led the NAIA in rebounding twice and registered a .637 field goal percentage.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He averaged over 25 points per game for his three-year NAIA career.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At the Portsmouth Invitational, a pre-draft camp for NBA hopefuls, he won Most Valuable Player honors and caught the attention of the <a href="Detroit_Pistons" title="wikilink">Detroit Pistons</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>During this time, Rodman worked at a summer youth basketball camp, where he befriended camper Byrne Rich, who was shy and withdrawn, following from a hunting accident in which he mistakenly shot and killed his best friend. The two became almost inseparable, and formed a bond. Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches due to being an African-American. But, the Riches were so grateful to him for bringing their son out of his shell that they were able to set aside their prejudices.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues himself, he &quot;adopted&quot; the Riches as his own in 1982 and went from the city life to &quot;driving a tractor and messing with cows.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Rodman credits the Riches as his &quot;surrogate family&quot; that helped him through college.</p>

<p>Rodman made himself eligible for the <a href="1986_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1986 NBA Draft</a>. He was drafted by the <a href="Detroit_Pistons" title="wikilink">Detroit Pistons</a> as the 27th pick in the second round, joining the rugged team of coach <a href="Chuck_Daly" title="wikilink">Chuck Daly</a> that was called &quot;Bad Boys&quot; for their hard-nosed approach to basketball. The squad featured <a href="Isiah_Thomas" title="wikilink">Isiah Thomas</a> and <a href="Joe_Dumars" title="wikilink">Joe Dumars</a> at the <a href="Basketball_position#Backcourt_(guards)" title="wikilink">guard</a> positions, <a href="Adrian_Dantley" title="wikilink">Adrian Dantley</a> and <a href="Sidney_Green_(basketball)" title="wikilink">Sidney Green</a> at forward, and <a href="center_(basketball)" title="wikilink">center</a> <a href="Bill_Laimbeer" title="wikilink">Bill Laimbeer</a>. Bench players who played more than 15 minutes per game were <a href="sixth_man" title="wikilink">sixth man</a> <a href="Vinnie_Johnson" title="wikilink">Vinnie Johnson</a> and the backup forwards <a href="Rick_Mahorn" title="wikilink">Rick Mahorn</a> and <a href="John_Salley" title="wikilink">John Salley</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Rodman fit well into this ensemble, providing 6.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and some tough defense in 15.0 minutes of playing time per game.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably entered the <a href="1987_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1987 NBA Playoffs</a>. They swept the <a href="Washington_Bullets" title="wikilink">Washington Bullets</a> and soundly beat the <a href="Atlanta_Hawks" title="wikilink">Atlanta Hawks</a> in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against their archrivals <a href="Boston_Celtics" title="wikilink">Boston Celtics</a> in what was called one of the physically and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard <a href="Dennis_Johnson" title="wikilink">Dennis Johnson</a>, taunting him in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> After the loss, Rodman made headlines by directly accusing Celtics star <a href="Larry_Bird" title="wikilink">Larry Bird</a> of being overrated because he was white: &quot;Larry Bird is overrated in a lot of areas. ...Why does he get so much publicity? Because he's white. You never hear about a black player being the greatest.&quot; Although teammate Thomas supported him, he endured harsh criticism, but avoided being called a <a href="racist" class="uri" title="wikilink">racist</a> because, according to him, his own girlfriend Anicka &quot;Annie&quot; Bakes was white.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In the following <a href="1987&lt;U+2013&gt;88_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1987&lt;U+2013&gt;88 season</a>, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6 points and 8.7 rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The Pistons fought their way into the <a href="1988_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1988 NBA Finals</a>, and took a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 lead, but lost in seven games against the <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15 points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman&lt;U+2019&gt;s defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52 minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled <a href="Magic_Johnson" title="wikilink">Magic Johnson</a>, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39 seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In that year, his girlfriend Annie bore him a daughter named Alexis.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>After just falling short of an NBA title, Rodman entered the <a href="1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89 season</a>. Still coming off the bench, he averaged nine points and nine rebounds in 26 minutes, providing such effective defense that he was voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, winning in six games versus the <a href="Chicago_Bulls" title="wikilink">Chicago Bulls</a> of scoring champion <a href="Michael_Jordan" title="wikilink">Michael Jordan</a> and easily defeating the Lakers with 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the <a href="1989_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1989 NBA Finals</a>. Although he was hampered by back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90 season</a>, Detroit lost perennial defensive forward Rick Mahorn due to the <a href="expansion_draft" title="wikilink">expansion draft</a> of the <a href="Minnesota_Timberwolves" title="wikilink">Minnesota Timberwolves</a>. It was feared that the loss of Mahorn &lt;U+2013&gt; average in talent, but high on hustle and widely considered a vital cog of the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; teams &lt;U+2013&gt; would diminish the Pistons&lt;U+2019&gt; spirit, but Rodman seamlessly took over his role.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He went on to win his first big individual accolade. Averaging nine points and 10 rebounds and starting in the last 43 regular season games, he established himself as the best defensive player in the game; during this period, the Pistons won 59 games, and Rodman was lauded by the NBA &quot;for his defense and rebounding skills, which were unparalleled in the league&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> For his feats, he won the <a href="NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award</a>; he also connected on a .595 field goal percentage, which made him the most precise shooter of the league.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In the <a href="1990_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1990 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Pistons beat the Bulls again, and in the <a href="1990_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1990 NBA Finals</a>, Detroit met the <a href="Portland_Trail_Blazers" title="wikilink">Portland Trail Blazers</a>. Rodman suffered from an injured ankle and was often replaced by <a href="Mark_Aguirre" title="wikilink">Mark Aguirre</a>, but even without his defensive hustle, Detroit beat Portland in five games and claimed their second title.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>After winning his second NBA championship ring, Rodman entered the <a href="1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91 season</a>. In that year, he finally established himself as the starting <a href="small_forward" title="wikilink">small forward</a> of the Pistons. He played such strong defense that the NBA stated he &quot;could shut down any opposing player, from point guard to center&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> After coming off the bench for most of his earlier years, he finally started in 77 of the 82 regular season games, averaged 8.2 points and 12.5 rebounds and won his second Defensive Player of the Year Award.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In the <a href="1991_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1991 NBA Playoffs</a> however, the Pistons were swept by the championship-winning Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. It was the <a href="1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92 season</a> where Rodman made a remarkable leap in his rebounding, collecting an astounding 18.7 rebounds per game (1,530 in total), winning his first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns, along with scoring 9.8 points per game, and made his first All-NBA Team.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His 1,530 rebounds (the most since <a href="Wilt_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Wilt Chamberlain</a>'s 1,572 in the <a href="1971&lt;U+2013&gt;72_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1971&lt;U+2013&gt;72 season</a>) have never been surpassed since then; the best mark not set by Rodman is credited to <a href="Kevin_Willis" title="wikilink">Kevin Willis</a>, who grabbed 1,258 boards in 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In a March 1992 game, he totaled a career high 34 total rebounds.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, the aging Pistons were eliminated by the upcoming <a href="New_York_Knicks" title="wikilink">New York Knicks</a> in the First Round of the <a href="1992_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1992 NBA Playoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Rodman experienced a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly resigned in May, whom he had admired as a surrogate father; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The following <a href="1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93 season</a> was even more tumultuous. He finally married Annie Bakes in September 1992, the mother of his four year old daughter Alexis, but the marriage went sour quickly and Bakes divorced him in December, an experience which left him traumatized.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Pistons won only 40 games and missed the <a href="1993_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1993 NBA Playoffs</a> entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography <em>As Bad As I Wanna Be</em>, he confessed having thought about <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> and described that night as an <a href="Epiphany_(feeling)" title="wikilink">epiphany</a>: &quot;I decided that instead [of killing myself] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go...

However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3 points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.</p>
<p>Rodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: &quot;I just took the chance to be my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to the <a href="1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 NBA season</a>, Rodman was traded to the <a href="Chicago_Bulls" title="wikilink">Chicago Bulls</a> of perennial scoring champion <a href="Michael_Jordan" title="wikilink">Michael Jordan</a> for center <a href="Will_Perdue" title="wikilink">Will Perdue</a> and cash considerations to fill a large void at power forward left by <a href="Horace_Grant" title="wikilink">Horace Grant</a>, who left the Bulls prior to the 1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95 season.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Although the trade for the already 34 year old and volatile Rodman was considered a gamble at that time,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> the power forward quickly adapted to his new environment, helped by the fact that his best friend Haley was also traded to the Bulls. Under coach <a href="Phil_Jackson" title="wikilink">Phil Jackson</a>, he scored an average of 5.5 points and 14.9 rebounds per game, winning yet another rebounding title, and was part of the great Bulls team that won 72 of 82 regular season games, an all-time NBA record.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> About playing next to iconic Jordan and hard-working <a href="Scottie_Pippen" title="wikilink">Scottie Pippen</a>, Rodman said: &quot;On the court, me and Michael are pretty calm and we can handle conversation. But as far as our lives go, I think he is moving in one direction and I'm going in the other. I mean, he's goin' north, I'm goin' south. And then you've got Scottie Pippen right in the middle. He's sort of the equator.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Although struggling with calf problems early in the season, Rodman grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times and had his first <a href="triple-double" class="uri" title="wikilink">triple-double</a> against the <a href="Philadelphia_76ers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia 76ers</a> on January 16, 1996 scoring 10 points and adding 21 rebounds and 10 assists; by playing his trademark tough defense, he joined Jordan and Pippen in the All-NBA Defense First Team, making it the first time that three players from the same NBA team made the All-NBA Defensive First Team.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a <a href="Headbutt" title="wikilink">head butt</a> of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> on March 16, 1996; he was fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In the <a href="1996_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1996 NBA Playoffs</a>, Rodman scored 7.5 points and grabbed 13.7 rebounds per game and had a large part in the six-game victory against the <a href="Seattle_SuperSonics" title="wikilink">Seattle SuperSonics</a> in the <a href="1996_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1996 NBA Finals</a>: in Game Two at home in the Bulls' <a href="United_Center" title="wikilink">United Center</a>, he grabbed 20 rebounds, among them a record-tying 11 offensive boards, and in Game Six, again at the United Center, the power forward secured 19 rebounds and again 11 offensive boards, scored five points in a decisive 12&lt;U+2013&gt;2 Bulls run, unnerved opposing power forward <a href="Shawn_Kemp" title="wikilink">Shawn Kemp</a> and caused Seattle coach <a href="George_Karl" title="wikilink">George Karl</a> to say: &quot;As you evaluate the series, Dennis Rodman won two basketball games. We controlled Dennis Rodman for four games. But Game 2 and tonight, he was the reason they were successful.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> His two games with 11 offensive rebounds each tied the NBA Finals record of <a href="Elvin_Hayes" title="wikilink">Elvin Hayes</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 NBA season</a>, Rodman won his sixth rebounding title en bloc with 16.7 boards per game, along with 5.7 points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> However, he made more headlines for his notorious behaviour: on January 15, 1997, he was involved in another incident during a game against the <a href="Minnesota_Timberwolves" title="wikilink">Minnesota Timberwolves</a>. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a <a href="technical_foul" title="wikilink">technical foul</a> at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000 settlement, the league suspended Rodman for 11 games without pay, thus he effectively lost $1 million.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the <a href="1997_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">1997 NBA Playoffs</a>, in which the Bulls reached the <a href="1997_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1997 NBA Finals</a> against the <a href="Utah_Jazz" title="wikilink">Utah Jazz</a>. There, he struggled to slow down Jazz power forward <a href="Karl_Malone" title="wikilink">Karl Malone</a>, but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>It was during this time that Rodman seriously took up his hobby of professional wrestling: he appeared in <a href="World_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">World Championship Wrestling</a> as a member of <a href="New_World_Order_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">nWo</a> with his friend <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a>. His first match was at the July 1997 <a href="Bash_at_the_Beach#1997" title="wikilink">Bash at the Beach</a> event where he teamed with Hogan in a loss to <a href="Lex_Luger" title="wikilink">Lex Luger</a> and <a href="Paul_Wight" title="wikilink">The Giant</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The regular season of the <a href="1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98 NBA season</a> ended with Rodman winning his seventh consecutive rebounding title with 15.0 boards per game, along with 4.7 points per game.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times, among them a 29-board outburst against the <a href="Atlanta_Hawks" title="wikilink">Atlanta Hawks</a> and 15 offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the <a href="Los_Angeles_Clippers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Clippers</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Led by the aging Jordan and Rodman (respectively 35 and 37 years old), the Bulls reached the <a href="1998_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1998 NBA Finals</a>, again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Karl Malone in the first three games,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a>. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten percent of what he earned with this stint.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> However, Rodman&lt;U+2019&gt;s on-court performance remained top-notch, again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39 points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward <a href="Bryon_Russell" title="wikilink">Bryon Russell</a>, the Bulls won their third title en bloc and Rodman his fifth ring.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>In the off-season, Rodman and Malone squared off again, this time in <a href="WCW" class="uri" title="wikilink">WCW</a> wrestling at the July 1998 edition of &lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;<a href="Bash_at_the_Beach#1998" title="wikilink">Bash at the Beach</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;. He fought alongside <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a>, and Malone tagged along with <a href="Diamond_Dallas_Page" title="wikilink">Diamond Dallas Page</a>. In a poorly-received match, the two power forwards exchanged &quot;rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines&quot; for 23 minutes.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Rodman garnered as much publicity for his public antics as he did for his basketball playing. He dated <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a> and claimed she tried to conceive a child with him.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Shortly after, Rodman famously wore a <a href="wedding_dress" title="wikilink">wedding dress</a> to promote his autobiography <em>Bad As I Wanna Be</em>, claimed that he was <a href="Bisexuality" title="wikilink">bisexual</a> and that he was &quot;marrying himself&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In November 1998, he married <a href="Carmen_Electra" title="wikilink">Carmen Electra</a> in a state of <a href="Alcohol_intoxication" title="wikilink">intoxication</a>, and the marriage was invalidated after just 10 days.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>After the <a href="1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1997&lt;U+2013&gt;98 NBA season</a>, the Bulls started a massive rebuilding phase, largely at the behest of then-general manager <a href="Jerry_Krause" title="wikilink">Jerry Krause</a>.

<p>From the beginning of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a <a href="small_forward" title="wikilink">small forward</a>, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards or guards equally well<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> and won two <a href="NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards</a>. From 1991 on, he established himself as one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 boards per game in six of the next seven years.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Playing <a href="Power_forward_(basketball)" title="wikilink">power forward</a> as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the <a href="1996_NBA_Finals" title="wikilink">1996 NBA Finals</a>: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, his personal best 34-rebound game on  is the third best board-grabbing performance since the  season, topped only by a 35-rebound game by <a href="Charles_Oakley" title="wikilink">Charles Oakley</a> on  and a 37-rebound game by <a href="Moses_Malone" title="wikilink">Moses Malone</a> on .<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>On offense, Rodman's output was mediocre. He averaged 11.6 points a game in his sophomore season, but his point average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, he averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of his field goal attempts.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> His free throw shooting (lifetime average: .584) was considered a big liability: on , <a href="Bubba_Wells" title="wikilink">Bubba Wells</a> of the <a href="Dallas_Mavericks" title="wikilink">Dallas Mavericks</a> committed six intentional fouls against him in only three minutes, setting a record for the fastest foul out in NBA history. This was Dallas coach <a href="Don_Nelson" title="wikilink">Don Nelson</a>'s early version of what would later develop into the famous &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot; method that would be implemented against <a href="Shaquille_O&#39;Neal" title="wikilink">Shaquille O'Neal</a> and other poor free throw shooters. The intention was to <a href="Hack-a-Shaq" title="wikilink">force him to attempt free throws</a>, which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points. However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit nine of these 12 attempts.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>In 14 NBA seasons, Rodman played in 911 games, scored 6,683 points and grabbed 11,954 rebounds, translating to 7.3 points and 13.1 rebounds per game in only 31.7 minutes played per game.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> NBA.com lauds Rodman as &quot;arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history and one of the most recognized athletes in the world&quot; but adds &quot;enigmatic and individualistic, Rodman has caught the public eye for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos and unorthodox lifestyle&quot;.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> On the hardwood, he was recognized as one of the most successful defensive players ever, winning the NBA championship five times in six NBA Finals appearances (1989, 1990, 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;8; only loss 1988), being crowned <a href="NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a> twice (1990, 1991) and making seven NBA All-Defensive First Teams (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;93, 1995, 1996) and NBA All-Defensive Second Teams (1994). He additionally made two All-NBA Third Teams (1992, 1995), two NBA All-Star Teams (1990, 1992) and won seven rebounding crowns (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;98) and finally led the league once in field goal percentage (1989).<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> However, he was recognized as the prototype bizarre player, stunning basketball fans with his artificial hair colors, numerous tattoos and body piercings, multiple verbal and physical assaults versus officials, frequent ejections, and his tumultuous private life.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He was ranked #48 on the 2009 revision of SLAM Magazine's Top 50 Players of All-time.</p>
