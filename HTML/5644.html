<h2 id="player-of-the-year-award">Player of the Year Award</h2>
<p>Card Player is also well known for its <em>Player of the Year Award</em>. Started in 1997, it goes to the player who has the most outstanding tournament results throughout the year. Players are awarded points for final-table finishes in major tournaments. Points that can be earned in a given tournament are adjusted based on the <a href="Buying_in_(poker)" title="wikilink">buy-in</a>, as well as the number of entrants.

<h2 id="spadeclub">SpadeClub</h2>
<p>In February, 2008, Card Player Media launched SpadeClub.com, an online poker website. Unlike traditional poker websites, SpadeClub is operated as a sweepstakes and is therefore legal in at least 36 states of the U.S. as well as some other countries.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Members of SpadeClub pay a monthly subscription fee and are able to enter into a variety of free poker tournaments. The prize pools vary depending upon the number of subscribers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> On September 15, 2010, Spadeclub ceased operations and migrated all users into Zen gaming.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
