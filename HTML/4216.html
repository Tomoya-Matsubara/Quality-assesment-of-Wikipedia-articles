<p><strong>Issy Smith</strong> <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">VC</a> (c. <a href="18_September" title="wikilink">18 September</a> <a href="1890" class="uri" title="wikilink">1890</a>–<a href="11_September" title="wikilink">11 September</a> <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a British-Australian recipient of the <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> and <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. Smith, the first living Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was also awarded the French <a href="Croix_de_Guerre" title="wikilink">Croix de Guerre</a> (with palm) and Russian <a href="Cross_of_St._George" title="wikilink">Cross of St. George</a> (4th class).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the <a href="Second_Battle_of_Ypres" title="wikilink">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. On <a href="26_April" title="wikilink">26 April</a> 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them &quot;with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>'s Jewish community, was appointed a <a href="Justice_of_the_Peace" title="wikilink">Justice of the Peace</a>, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the <a href="United_Australia_Party" title="wikilink">United Australia Party</a> in the <a href="Australian_general_election,_1931" title="wikilink">1931 general election</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Polish origin.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the <a href="East_End_of_London" title="wikilink">East End</a>, then an impoverished <a href="ghetto" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghetto</a> where <a href="Yiddish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yiddish</a> was the predominant spoken language.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the <a href="Aliens_Act_1905" title="wikilink">Aliens Act</a> in 1905.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> and <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played <a href="soccer" title="wikilink">football</a>. While in India, Smith was present at the <a href="Delhi_Durbar" title="wikilink">Delhi Durbar</a> parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of <a href="Ascot_Vale,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Ascot Vale</a> while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of <a href="German_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">German New Guinea</a> by the <a href="Australian_Naval_and_Military_Expeditionary_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

The battalion disembarked at <a href="Marseilles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marseilles</a> in late September, but was not deployed to the front until <a href="26_October" title="wikilink">26 October</a> 1914, when it occupied trenches east of <a href="Festubert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Festubert</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Actively engaged in the battles of <a href="Battle_of_Givenchy" title="wikilink">Givenchy</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Neuve_Chapelle" title="wikilink">Neuve Chapelle</a>, the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of <a href="Second_Battle_of_Ypres" title="wikilink">&quot;Second Ypres&quot;</a> on <a href="22_April" title="wikilink">22 April</a> 1915.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Chemical_warfare" title="wikilink">Chemical warfare</a> first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on <a href="26_April" title="wikilink">26 April</a> 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other Allied units.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Rudimentary forms of protection against the <a href="chlorine_gas" title="wikilink">chlorine gas</a> proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some  to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in &quot;many more wounded men&quot; throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions &quot;regardless of personal risk&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a <a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a> correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: &quot;He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a> by <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George V</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Feted by publications such as the <a href="Jewish_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Jewish Chronicle</a>, Smith's status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross from his former schoolmates.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Also that month, Smith was received at <a href="Mansion_House,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Mansion House, Dublin</a> by the <a href="Under-Secretary_for_Ireland" title="wikilink">Under-Secretary for Ireland</a> <a href="Matthew_Nathan" title="wikilink">Matthew Nathan</a>, who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> While documenting his recruitment drive, the Jewish Chronicle reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of <a href="Yorkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at <a href="Battle_of_Loos" title="wikilink">Loos</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on <a href="10_December" title="wikilink">10 December</a>, 1915 and arriving in <a href="Basra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basra</a> on <a href="8_January" title="wikilink">8 January</a> 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in <a href="Mesopotamian_Campaign" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Sinai_and_Palestine_Campaign" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> until the cessation of hostilities with the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> and Germany on <a href="30_October" title="wikilink">30 October</a> and <a href="11_November" title="wikilink">11 November</a> respectively. He had been wounded five times.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a>, given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the <a href="Indian_Rebellion_of_1857" title="wikilink">Indian Mutiny</a>, <a href="Rorke&#39;s_Drift" title="wikilink">Rorke's Drift</a>, <a href="Nile_Expedition" title="wikilink">Relief of General Gordon</a>, the <a href="Boer_War" title="wikilink">Boer Wars</a>, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">Great War</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In October 1921, with <a href="Henry_Edward_Kenny" title="wikilink"> Harry Kenny VC</a>, he unveiled the Hackney War Memorial.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1922, he attended &quot;The Pilgrimage to Ypres&quot;, in Belgium, laying a wreath at the <a href="Cloth_Hall,_Ypres" title="wikilink">Cloth Hall</a> there.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As a consequence he pawned his medals for <a href="pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>20, only for them to be recovered by the <a href="Jewish_Historical_Society_of_England" title="wikilink">Jewish Historical Society</a> on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi <a href="Joseph_H._Hertz" title="wikilink">Joseph H.
