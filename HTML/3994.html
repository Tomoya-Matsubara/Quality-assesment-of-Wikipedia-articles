<p>The station is located in an open cut, and the railway line enters tunnels in both directions. The ticket office and platform 1 (generally used by northbound trains) can be accessed directly from street level on the west side of the station or by a footbridge from the east side; platform 2 (generally used by southbound trains) is accessible only by stairs - there is a gate at the south end of platform 2 giving step-free access which is usually kept locked but which station staff will open on request for those who need it. Both platforms are signalled for reversible working - trains can arrive/depart at either platform in either direction.</p>

The branch closed on 6 July 1985. Before the closure of the branch, the station was called <strong>Tunbridge Wells Central</strong>.</p>
