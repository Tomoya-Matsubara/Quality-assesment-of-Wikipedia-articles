<p><strong>Miller James Huggins</strong> (March 27, 1879 &lt;U+2013&gt; September 25, 1929) was an American <a href="professional_baseball" title="wikilink">professional baseball</a> player and <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a>. A <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second baseman</a>, Huggins played in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> for the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;1909) and <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913&lt;U+2013&gt;1917) and <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> (1918&lt;U+2013&gt;1929), including the <a href="Murderers&#39;_Row" title="wikilink">Murderers' Row</a> teams of the 1920s that won six <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> (AL) pennants and three <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> championships.</p>
<p>Huggins was born in <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. He received a degree in law from the <a href="University_of_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">University of Cincinnati</a>, where he was also <a href="captain_(baseball)" title="wikilink">captain</a> on the <a href="Cincinnati_Bearcats_baseball" title="wikilink">baseball team</a>. Rather than serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. He played <a href="semi-professional" class="uri" title="wikilink">semi-professional</a> and <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a> from 1898 through 1903, at which time he signed with the Reds.</p>
<p>As a player, Huggins was adept at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning the nicknames &quot;Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Little Everywhere&quot;, and &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; for his defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to maintain his teams' superiority in the AL. He was elected to the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> by the <a href="Veterans_Committee" title="wikilink">Veterans Committee</a> in 1964.</p>
