<p>In <a href="meter_(poetry)" title="wikilink">prosody</a>, <strong>alliterative verse</strong> is a form of <a href="verse" class="uri" title="wikilink">verse</a> that uses <a href="alliteration" class="uri" title="wikilink">alliteration</a> as the principal structuring device to unify lines of poetry, as opposed to other devices such as <a href="rhyme" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhyme</a>.</p>
<p>The most intensively studied traditions of alliterative verse are those found in the oldest literature of many <a href="Germanic_language" title="wikilink">Germanic languages</a>. Alliterative verse, in various forms, is found widely in the literary traditions of the early Germanic languages. The <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <a href="Epic_poetry" title="wikilink">epic</a> <em><a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a></em>, as well as most other <a href="Old_English_poetry" title="wikilink">Old English poetry</a>, the <a href="Old_High_German" title="wikilink">Old High German</a> <em><a href="Muspilli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muspilli</a></em>, the <a href="Old_Saxon" title="wikilink">Old Saxon</a> <em><a href="Heliand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heliand</a></em>, and the <a href="Old_Norse_language" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> <em><a href="Poetic_Edda" title="wikilink">Poetic Edda</a></em> all use alliterative verse.</p>
<p>Alliterative verse can be found in many other languages as well, although rarely with the systematic rigor of Germanic forms. The <a href="Finland" title="wikilink">Finnish</a> <a href="Kalevala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalevala</a> and the <a href="Estonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Estonian</a> <a href="Kalevipoeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalevipoeg</a> both use alliterative forms derived from folk tradition. Traditional <a href="Turkic_languages" title="wikilink">Turkic</a> verse, for example that of the <a href="Uyghur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uyghur</a>, is also alliterative.</p>
<h2 id="common-germanic-origins-and-features">Common Germanic origins and features</h2>
<p>The poetic forms found in the various Germanic languages are not identical, but there is sufficient similarity to make it clear that they are closely related traditions, stemming from a common Germanic source. Our knowledge about that common tradition, however, is based almost entirely on inference from surviving poetry.</p>
<p>One statement we have about the nature of alliterative verse from a practicing alliterative poet is that of <a href="Snorri_Sturluson" title="wikilink">Snorri Sturluson</a> in the <a href="Prose_Edda" title="wikilink">Prose Edda</a>. He describes metrical patterns and poetic devices used by <a href="skald" title="wikilink">skaldic</a> poets around the year 1200. Snorri's description has served as the starting point for scholars to reconstruct alliterative meters beyond those of Old Norse. There have been many different metrical theories proposed, all of them attended with controversy. Looked at broadly, however, certain basic features are common from the earliest to the latest poetry.</p>
<p>Alliterative verse has been found in some of the earliest monuments of Germanic literature. The <a href="Golden_horns_of_Gallehus" title="wikilink">Golden horns of Gallehus</a>, discovered in <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> and likely dating to the <a href="4th_century" title="wikilink">fourth century</a>, bears this <a href="rune" title="wikilink">Runic</a> inscription in <a href="Proto-Norse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proto-Norse</a>:</p>
<p><code>x    / x x  x   /  x x      /  x  / x x</code><br />
<code>ek hlewagasti&lt;U+0280&gt; holtija&lt;U+0280&gt; || horna tawid&lt;U+00F4&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>(I, Hlewagastir son of Holti, made the horn.)</code></p>
<p>This inscription contains four strongly stressed syllables, the first three of which alliterate on /h/, essentially the same pattern found in much latter verse.</p>
<p>Originally all alliterative poetry was composed and transmitted orally, and much has been lost through time since it went unrecorded. The degree to which writing may have altered this oral artform remains much in dispute. Nevertheless, there is a broad consensus among scholars that the written verse retains many (and some would argue almost all) of the features of the spoken language.</p>
<p>Alliteration fits naturally with the <a href="prosody_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">prosodic</a> patterns of Germanic languages. Alliteration essentially involves matching the left edges of stressed syllables. Early Germanic languages share a left-prominent prosodic pattern. In other words, stress falls on the root syllable of a word. This is normally the initial syllable, except where the root is preceded by an unstressed prefix (as in past participles, for example).</p>
<p>The core metrical features of traditional Germanic alliterative verse are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A long-line is divided into two half-lines. Half-lines are also known as verses or <a href="hemistich" title="wikilink">hemistichs</a>; the first is called the a-verse (or on-verse), the second the b-verse (or off-verse).</li>
<li>A heavy pause, or <a href="caesura" title="wikilink">c&lt;U+00E6&gt;sura</a>, separates the verses.</li>
<li>Each verse usually has two strongly stressed syllables, or &quot;lifts&quot;.</li>
<li>The first lift in the b-verse must <a href="alliteration" title="wikilink">alliterate</a> with either or both lifts in the a-verse.</li>
<li>The second lift in the b-verse does not alliterate with the first lifts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patterns of unstressed syllables vary significantly in the alliterative traditions of different Germanic languages. The rules for these patterns remain controversial and imperfectly understood.</p>
<p>The need to find an appropriate alliterating word gave certain other distinctive features to alliterative verse as well. Alliterative poets drew on a specialized vocabulary of poetic synonyms rarely used in prose texts and used standard images and <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphors</a> called <em><a href="kenning" title="wikilink">kennings</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="old-english-poetic-forms">Old English poetic forms</h2>
<p>Old English poetry appears to be based upon one system of verse construction, a system which remained remarkably consistent for centuries, although some patterns of classical Old English verse begin to break down at the end of the Old English period.</p>
<p>The most widely used system of classification is based on that developed by <a href="Eduard_Sievers" title="wikilink">Eduard Sievers</a>. It should be emphasized that <a href="Sievers&#39;_Theory_of_Anglo-Saxon_Meter" title="wikilink">Sievers' system</a> is fundamentally a method of categorization rather than a full theory of meter. It does not, in other words, purport to describe the system the scops actually used to compose their verse, nor does it explain why certain patterns are favored or avoided. Sievers divided verses into five basic types, labeled A-E. The system is founded upon accent, alliteration, the quantity of vowels, and patterns of syllabic accentuation.</p>
<h3 id="accent">Accent</h3>
<p>A line of poetry in Old English consists of two half-lines or verses, <em>distichs</em>, with a pause or <em>caesura</em> in the middle of the line. Each half-line has two accented syllables. The following example from the poem <em><a href="Battle_of_Maldon" title="wikilink">Battle of Maldon</a></em>, spoken by the warrior <a href="Byrhtnoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byrhtnoth</a>, shows this:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>Hige sceal &lt;U+00FE&gt;e heardra,</em> || <em>heorte &lt;U+00FE&gt;e cenre,</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>mod sceal &lt;U+00FE&gt;e mare,</em> || <em>&lt;U+00FE&gt;e ure m&lt;U+00E6&gt;gen lytla&lt;U+00F0&gt;</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>(&quot;Courage must be the greater, heart the bolder, spirit the greater, the more our strength is diminished.&quot;)
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="alliteration">Alliteration</h3>
<p>Alliteration is the principal binding agent of Old English poetry. Two syllables alliterate when they begin with the same sound; all vowels alliterate together, but the consonant clusters <em>st-</em>, <em>sp-</em> and <em>sc-</em> are treated as separate sounds (so <em>st-</em> does not alliterate with <em>s-</em> or <em>sp-</em>). On the other hand, in Old English unpalatized <em>c</em> (pronounced /k/) alliterated with palatized <em>c</em> (pronounced /ch/), and unpalatized <em>g</em> (pronounced /g/) likewise alliterated with palatized <em>g</em> (pronounced /y/). (This is because the poetic form was inherited from a time before /k/ and /g/ had split into palatized and unpalatized variants.)</p>
<p>The first stressed syllable of the off-verse, or second half-line, usually alliterates with one or both of the stressed syllables of the on-verse, or first half-line. The second stressed syllable of the off-verse does not usually alliterate with the others.</p>
<h3 id="survivals">Survivals</h3>
<p>Just as rhyme was seen in some Anglo-Saxon poems (e.g. <em><a href="The_Rhyming_Poem" title="wikilink">The Rhyming Poem</a></em>, and, to some degree, <em><a href="The_Proverbs_of_Alfred" title="wikilink">The Proverbs of Alfred</a></em>), the use of alliterative verse continued into <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a>. <a href="Layamon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Layamon</a>'s <em>Brut</em>, written in about 1215, uses a loose alliterative scheme. The <a href="Pearl_Poet" title="wikilink">Pearl Poet</a> uses one of the most sophisticated alliterative schemes extant in <em><a href="Pearl_(poem)" title="wikilink">Pearl</a>,</em> <em><a href="Cleanness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleanness</a>,</em> and <em><a href="Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight" title="wikilink">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></em>. Even later, <a href="William_Langland" title="wikilink">William Langland</a>'s <em><a href="Piers_Plowman" title="wikilink">Piers Plowman</a></em> is a major work in <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> that is written in alliterative verse; it was written between 1360 and 1399. Though a thousand years have passed between this work and the Golden Horn of Gallehus, the poetic form remains much the same:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>A feir feld full of folk</em> || <em>fond I &lt;U+00FE&gt;er bitwene,</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Of alle maner of men,</em> || <em>&lt;U+00FE&gt;e mene and &lt;U+00FE&gt;e riche,</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Worchinge and wandringe</em> || <em>as &lt;U+00FE&gt;e world aske&lt;U+00FE&gt;.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Among them I found a fair field full of people
</dd>
<dd>All manner of men, the poor and the rich
</dd>
<dd>Working and wandering as the world requires.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alliteration was sometimes used together with rhyme in Middle English work, as in <em>Pearl</em>. In general, Middle English poets were somewhat loose about the number of stresses; in <em>Sir Gawain</em>, for instance, there are many lines with additional alliterating stresses (e.g. l.2, &quot;the borgh brittened and brent to brondez and askez&quot;), and the medial pause is not always strictly maintained.</p>
<p>After the fifteenth century, alliterative verse became fairly uncommon, although some alliterative poems, such as <a href="Pierce_the_Ploughman&#39;s_Crede" title="wikilink">Pierce the Ploughman's Crede</a> (ca. 1400) and <a href="William_Dunbar" title="wikilink">William Dunbar</a>'s superb <em><a href="Tretis_of_the_Tua_Marriit_Women_and_the_Wedo" title="wikilink">Tretis of the Tua Marriit Women and the Wedo</a></em> (ca. 1500) were written in the form in the 15th century. However, by 1600, the four-beat alliterative line had completely vanished, at least from the written tradition.</p>
<p>Alliterative verse is occasionally written by modern authors. <a href="J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> composed several poems about <a href="Middle-earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middle-earth</a> in Old English alliterative verse; these poems were found among his papers and published posthumously. <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W. H. Auden</a> also wrote a number of his poems, including <em><a href="The_Age_of_Anxiety_(poem)" title="wikilink">The Age of Anxiety</a></em>, in alliterative verse, modified only slightly to fit the phonetic patterns of modern English. The noun-laden style of the headlines makes the style of alliterative verse particularly apt for Auden's poem:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>Now the news. Night raids on</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Five cities. Fires started.</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Pressure applied by pincer movement</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>In threatening thrust. Third Division</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Enlarges beachhead. Lucky charm</em>
</dd>
<dd><em>Saves sniper. Sabotage hinted</em>
</dd>
<dd>''In steel-mill stoppage. . . . ''
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other poets who have experimented with modern alliterative English verse include <a href="Ezra_Pound" title="wikilink">Ezra Pound</a>, and <a href="Richard_Wilbur" title="wikilink">Richard Wilbur</a>, whose <em>Junk</em> opens with the lines:</p>
<dl>

<p>Many translations of Beowulf use alliterative techniques. Among recent ones that of <a href="Seamus_Heaney" title="wikilink">Seamus Heaney</a> loosely follows the rules of modern alliterative verse while the translation of Alan Sullivan and Timothy Murphy follows those rules more closely.</p>
<h2 id="old-norse-poetic-forms">Old Norse poetic forms</h2>
<p>The inherited form of alliterative verse was modified somewhat in <a href="Old_Norse_poetry" title="wikilink">Old Norse poetry</a>. In Old Norse, as a result of phonetic changes from the original common Germanic language, many unstressed <a href="syllable" title="wikilink">syllables</a> were lost. This lent Old Norse verse a characteristic terseness; the lifts tended to be crowded together at the expense of the weak syllables. In some lines, the weak syllables have been entirely suppressed. From the <em><a href="H&lt;U+00E1&gt;vam&lt;U+00E1&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00E1&gt;vam&lt;U+00E1&gt;l</a></em>:</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>(&quot;Cattle die; friends die. . .&quot;)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The various names of the Old Norse verse forms are given in the <a href="Prose_Edda" title="wikilink">Prose Edda</a> by <a href="Snorri_Sturluson" title="wikilink">Snorri Sturluson</a>. The <em><a href="H&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttatal" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttatal</a></em>, or &quot;list of verse forms&quot;, contains the names and characteristics of each of the fixed forms of Norse poetry.</p>
<h3 id="fornyru00f0islag">Fornyr&lt;U+00F0&gt;islag</h3>
<p>A verse form close to that of <em>Beowulf</em> existed in <a href="runestone" title="wikilink">runestones</a> and in the Old Norse <a href="Edda" title="wikilink">Eddas</a>; in Norse, it was called <em>fornyr&lt;U+00F0&gt;islag</em>, which means &quot;past-words-made&quot; or &quot;way of ancient words&quot;. The Norse poets tended to break up their verses into <a href="stanza" title="wikilink">stanzas</a> of from two to eight lines (or more), rather than writing continuous verse after the Old English model. The loss of unstressed syllables made these verses seem denser and more emphatic. The Norse poets, unlike the Old English poets, tended to make each line a complete syntactic unit, avoiding <a href="enjambment" class="uri" title="wikilink">enjambment</a> where a thought begun on one line continues through the following lines; only seldom do they begin a new sentence in the second half-line. This example is from the <em><a href="Waking_of_Angantyr" title="wikilink">Waking of Angantyr</a></em>:</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Fornyr&lt;U+00F0&gt;islag</em> has two lifts per half line, with two or three (sometimes one) unstressed syllables. At least two lifts, usually three, alliterate, always including the main stave (the first lift of the second half-line).</p>
<p><em>Fornyr&lt;U+00F0&gt;islag</em> had a variant form called <em>m&lt;U+00E1&gt;lah&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</em> (&quot;speech meter&quot;), which adds an unstressed syllable to each half-line, making six to eight (sometimes up to ten) unstressed syllables per line.</p>
<h3 id="lju00f3u00f0ahu00e1ttr">Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;ah&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</h3>
<p>Change in form came with the development of <em>lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;ah&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</em>, which means &quot;song&quot; or &quot;<a href="ballad" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballad</a> metre&quot;, a <a href="stanza" title="wikilink">stanzaic</a> verse form that created four line stanzas. The odd numbered lines were almost standard lines of alliterative verse with four lifts and two or three alliterations, with c&lt;U+00E6&gt;sura; the even numbered lines had three lifts and two alliterations, and no c&lt;U+00E6&gt;sura. This example is from <a href="Freyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freyr</a>'s lament in <em><a href="Sk&lt;U+00ED&gt;rnism&lt;U+00E1&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sk&lt;U+00ED&gt;rnism&lt;U+00E1&gt;l</a></em>:</p>

<p>A number of variants occurred in <em>lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;ah&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</em>, including <em>galdrah&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</em> or <em>kvi&lt;U+00F0&gt;uh&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</em> (&quot;incantation meter&quot;), which adds a fifth short (three-lift) line to the end of the stanza; in this form, usually the fifth line echoes the fourth one.</p>
<h3 id="dru00f3ttkvu00e6tt">Dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt</h3>
<p><img src="Koppardosa_fr&lt;U+00E5&gt;n_Sigtuna_med_runinskrift_i_drottkv&lt;U+00E4&gt;de_(ur_Sveriges_Runinskrifter).png" title="fig:Box of copper from Sigtuna with a dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt verse written with the runic alphabet" alt="Box of copper from Sigtuna with a dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt verse written with the runic alphabet" /> These verse forms were elaborated even more into the <a href="skald" title="wikilink">skaldic</a> poetic form called the <em>dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt</em>, meaning &quot;<a href="lord" title="wikilink">lordly</a> verse&quot;, which added internal rhymes and other forms of <a href="assonance" class="uri" title="wikilink">assonance</a> that go well beyond the requirements of Germanic alliterative verse. The <em>dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt</em> stanza had eight lines, each having three lifts. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants (which was called <em>skothending</em>) with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal <a href="rhyme" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhyme</a> (<em>a&lt;U+00F0&gt;alhending</em>) in the syllables, not necessarily at the end of the word. The form was subject to further restrictions: each half-line must have exactly six syllables, and each line must always end in a <a href="trochee" class="uri" title="wikilink">trochee</a>.</p>
<p>The requirements of this verse form were so demanding that occasionally the text of the poems had to run parallel, with one thread of <a href="syntax" class="uri" title="wikilink">syntax</a> running through the on-side of the half-lines, and another running through the off-side. According to the <em><a href="Fagrskinna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fagrskinna</a></em> collection of <a href="sagas" class="uri" title="wikilink">sagas</a>, King <a href="Harald_III_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Harald III of Norway</a> uttered these lines of <em>dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt</em> at the <a href="Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a>; the internal assonances and the alliteration are bolded:</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The bracketed words in the poem (&quot;so said the goddess of hawk-land, true of words&quot;) are syntactically separate, but interspersed within the text of the rest of the verse. The elaborate <em>kennings</em> manifested here are also practically necessary in this complex and demanding form, as much to solve metrical difficulties as for the sake of vivid imagery. Intriguingly, the saga claims that Harald improvised these lines after he gave a lesser performance (in <em>fornyr&lt;U+00F0&gt;islag</em>); Harald judged that verse bad, and then offered this one in the more demanding form. While the exchange may be fictionalized, the scene illustrates the regard in which the form was held.</p>

<p>Hrynhenda is a later development of <em>dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt</em> with eight syllables per line instead of six, but with the same rules for rhyme and alliteration. It is first attested around 985 in the so-called <em>Hafger&lt;U+00F0&gt;ingadr&lt;U+00E1&gt;pa</em> of which four lines survive (alliterants and rhymes bolded):</p>

The metre gained some popularity in courtly poetry, as the rhythm may sound more majestic than dr&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttkv&lt;U+00E6&gt;tt.</p>
<p>Alliterative poetry is still practiced in <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> in an unbroken tradition since the settlement.</p>

<p><a href="Old_High_German" title="wikilink">Old High German</a> and <a href="Old_Saxon" title="wikilink">Old Saxon</a> alliterative verse is problematic.</p>
<p>The two Old Saxon alliterative poems, the fragmentary <em><a href="Heliand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heliand</a></em> and the even more fragmentary <em><a href="Genesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genesis</a></em> are both Christian poems, created as written works of Biblical content based on Latin sources, and not derived from oral tradition. It is therefore impossible to say whether the characteristic features of the alliterative technique in these poems genuinely represent the unrecorded oral tradition or the style of an individual author more at home with written literature.</p>
<p>The <a href="Old_High_German" title="wikilink">Old High German</a> corpus of alliterative verse is tiny. Less than 200 lines survive, in four works: the <em><a href="Hildebrandslied" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hildebrandslied</a></em>, <em><a href="Muspilli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muspilli</a></em>, the <em><a href="Merseburg_Charms" title="wikilink">Merseburg Charms</a></em> and the <em><a href="Wessobrunn_Prayer" title="wikilink">Wessobrunn Prayer</a></em>. All four are preserved in forms that are clearly to some extent corrupt, suggesting that the scribes may themselves not have been entirely familiar with the poetic tradition.</p>
<p>However, both German traditions show one common feature which much less common elsewhere: a proliferation of unaccented syllables. Generally these are <a href="part_of_speech" title="wikilink">parts of speech</a> which would naturally be unstressed - <a href="pronoun" title="wikilink">pronouns</a>, <a href="preposition" title="wikilink">prepositions</a>, <a href="Article_(grammar)" title="wikilink">articles</a>, <a href="modal_auxiliary" title="wikilink">modal auxiliaries</a> - but in the Old Saxon works there also <a href="adjective" title="wikilink">adjectives</a> and <a href="lexical_verb" title="wikilink">lexical verbs</a>. The unaccented syllables typically occur before the first stress in the half-line, and most often in the b-verse.</p>
<p>The <em>Hildbrandslied</em>, lines 4-5:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em><strong>G</strong>arutun se iro <strong>g</strong>u&lt;U+00F0&gt;hamun, &lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt; <strong>g</strong>urtun sih iro suert ana,<br />

<dd>They prepared their fighting outfits,&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;girded their swords on,<br />
the heroes, over ringmail&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;when they to that fight rode.

<p>The <em>Heliand</em>, line 3062:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em><strong>S</strong>&lt;U+00E2&gt;lig bist thu <strong>S</strong>&lt;U+00EE&gt;mon, qua&lt;U+00F0&gt; he, <strong>s</strong>unu Ionases;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;ni mahtes thu that <strong>s</strong>elbo gehuggean</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd><dl>

<dd>Blessed are you Simon, he said, son of Jonah;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;&lt;U+00A0&gt;for you did not see that yourself (Matthew 16, 17)
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This leads to a less dense style, no doubt closer to everyday language, which has been interpreted both as a sign of decadent technique from ill-tutored poets and as an artistic innovation giving scope for additional poetic effects. Either way, it signifies a break with the strict Sievers typology.</p>
