<ul>
<li>March 2003 Svelana Aronov's body was found in New York's Upper East River. Family and friends consulted Carla Baron by email who stated that Svelana was fleeing an &quot;obsessed kidnapper&quot; and jumped into the freezing waters to escape. Police at the 19th Precinct could not confirm Barons statement that she had a &quot;lengthy conversation with a detective.&quot; A friend that reached out to Baron and other psychic detectives said they (psychics) only yielded &quot;aggravation&quot;. Close friends and family members now say they &quot;distrust Barton who they say 'provided no useful insights and demanded media attention from the start.'&quot; The New York medical examiner now claims that it was probably suicide.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2004 Carla Baron was approached by Susan Tusing, the mother of slain murder victim Amanda Tusing who had been found murdered in June 2000. Baron gave detectives the first name of the killer. Detective Jack McCann states &quot;we talked to the name and came up with several other people (with the same name) and nothing came up.&quot; As of 2010 the murderer of Amanda Tusing has not been found.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>

<li>The Independent Investigative Group <a href="IIG" class="uri" title="wikilink">IIG</a> looked into 14 cases Carla Baron claims to have assisted detectives on, including <a href="JonBen&lt;U+00E9&gt;t_Ramsey" title="wikilink">JonBen&lt;U+00E9&gt;t Ramsey</a>, <a href="Elizabeth_Smart" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Smart</a> and <a href="Nicole_Brown_Simpson" title="wikilink">Nicole Brown Simpson</a>. In all 14 cases the IIG contacted the police (or in the case of Nicole Simpson, they received an email from <a href="Denise_Brown" title="wikilink">Denise Brown</a>) all mostly saying the same things, &quot;we have never heard of this person&quot; or &quot;the information provided (by Baron) did not produce any new leads in the investigation&quot;. IIG's conclusion is that she has never provided any help in any investigation, and her claims stating such are unsubstantiated. The IIG feels that because humans are basically compassionate we have invented <a href="forensic_science" title="wikilink">forensic science</a> as well as <a href="Amber_Alert" title="wikilink">Amber Alert</a> and websites such as <a href="NCMEC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCMEC</a> to really help support victims of crimes. Psychic detectives like Carla Baron might claim compassion but are essentially paid agents with book sales, TV shows, lectures and private readings. Why are they needed when they cannot show one single case of evidence proving they have been helpful?<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <ref></li>

<li>April 13, 2011, 20 year old nursing student Holly Bobo goes missing from her home in Tennessee. Carla Baron was initially contacted by a friend of the family and Baron claims to have offered her services for free but the family refused to consult with her. On Baron's personal website she states that one condition she imposed on the family is that she is to be the only psychic officially working the case. When the family rejected her offer for help Baron stated &quot;(the family) chose not to seek her information on Holly's death on the advice of the police, who, Baron believes, were &quot;terrified to hear what I might have to say&quot; about the abduction. The response to this from Baron's website, &lt;U+201C&gt;This, my friends, is yet another &lt;U+201C&gt;control&lt;U+201D&gt; tactic deployed by the infinite &lt;U+2018&gt;powers-that-be&lt;U+2019&gt; within gov&lt;U+2019&gt;t jurisdiction to let all of us (a.k.a., the &lt;U+2018&gt;public&lt;U+2019&gt;) know &lt;U+2013&gt;Who&lt;U+2019&gt;s really running the show. Let&lt;U+2019&gt;s not let anyone steal their proverbial thunder, shall we?&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="Skeptic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skeptic</a> investigator Ben Radford writing for Discovery News states that the police and the family probably decided not to seek out her help because psychic detectives have a &quot;zero track record of success&quot;. While some psychics may be well-intended they do waste the police's time. Radford concludes, &quot;Despite the efforts of dozens of psychics over two months, Bobo remains missing, the case remains unsolved.&quot; <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
