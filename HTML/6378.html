<h2 id="life-and-times">Life and times</h2>
<p>Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Buzzi was born in <a href="Comodoro_Rivadavia" title="wikilink">Comodoro Rivadavia</a> in 1967. A third-generation <a href="Chubut_Province" title="wikilink">Chubut Province</a> native, he entolled at the <a href="National_University_of_Patagonia_San_Juan_Bosco" title="wikilink">National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco</a> and earned a <a href="PhD" class="uri" title="wikilink">PhD</a> in <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Following graduation, he joined the Institute of Public Policy at the National Academy of Sciences in 1991, and served as an adviser to a local oil industry executive, Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He and his wife, Carolina, have two sons.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He published his first textbook, <em>On the Theory of Regions in Argentina</em>, in 1993, and in 1994, entered public service as Director of Planning for his native Comodoro Rivadavia. Buzzi authored a textbook on the study of German social scientist <a href="Max_Weber" title="wikilink">Max Weber</a> in 1994, and was named Professor of Political Science at his alma mater between 1995 and 2003. He served in a number of local business <a href="advocacy_group" title="wikilink">advocacy groups</a>, and became Vice President of the Institute for the Regional Development of <a href="Patagonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patagonia</a>. A term as Director of the Municipal Employment and Production Bureau was followed in December 2003 by his appointment as Provincial Minister of Production by the newly-elected Governor, <a href="Mario_Das_Neves" title="wikilink">Mario Das Neves</a>; Das Neves appointed him Minister of Foreign Trade, Tourism, and Investment in February 2007.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>He resigned in July, and ran successfully for the post of Mayor of Comodoro Rivadavia on the <a href="Justicialist_Party" title="wikilink">Justicialist Party</a> ticket. Buzzi maintained a low profile as mayor, during which tenure he also avoided aligning himself too visibly with any one faction of the traditionally fractious <a href="Peronist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peronist</a> movement. He thus earned the governor's trust, and in 2011, was nominated as his party's candidate for Governor to succeed Das Neves.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The race attracted three strong candidates: <a href="Puerto_Madryn" title="wikilink">Puerto Madryn</a> Mayor Carlos Eliceche (<a href="Front_for_Victory" title="wikilink">Front for Victory</a>), <a href="Rada_Tilly" title="wikilink">Rada Tilly</a> Mayor Pedro Peralta (<a href="Radical_Civic_Union" title="wikilink">Radical Civic Union</a>), and Buzzi; another city mayor, Gustavo MacCarthy of <a href="Trelew" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trelew</a>, was nominated as Buzzi's running-mate. The <a href="Argentine_provincial_elections,_2011#March_20" title="wikilink">elections</a>, held on March 20, yielded inconclusive results, however, as Buzzi's total of 37.8% (against Eliceche's 37.2%), and his winning margin of 1,551 votes led to a <a href="recount" class="uri" title="wikilink">recount</a> when irregularities triggered a judicial <a href="injunction" class="uri" title="wikilink">injunction</a> against results in six precincts totaling 1,967 votes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A protracted recount process followed, as well a court-ordered re-vote held on May 29 in the six impugned precincts. Buzzi, albeit with a narrowed lead of 384 votes, was officially elected Governor of Chubut.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
