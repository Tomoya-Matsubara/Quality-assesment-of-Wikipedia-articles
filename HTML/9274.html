<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Because traditional Japanese garb lacked pockets, objects were often carried by hanging them from the <a href="obi_(sash)" title="wikilink">obi</a>, or sash, in containers known as <em>sagemono</em> (a Japanese generic term for a hanging object attached to a sash). Most sagemono were created for specialized contents, such as tobacco, pipes, writing brush and ink, but the type known as inr&lt;U+014D&gt; was suitable for carrying anything small.</p>
<p>Consisting of a stack of tiny, nested boxes, <em>inr&lt;U+014D&gt;</em> were most commonly used to carry <a href="Hanko_(stamp)" title="wikilink">identity seals</a> and medicine. The stack of boxes is held together by a cord that is laced through cord runners down one side, under the bottom, and up the opposite side. The ends of the cord are secured to a <a href="netsuke" class="uri" title="wikilink">netsuke</a>, a kind of toggle that is passed between the sash and pants and then hooked over the top of the sash to suspend the inr&lt;U+014D&gt;. An <a href="ojime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ojime</a>, or bead, is provided on the cords between the inr&lt;U+014D&gt; and netsuke to hold the boxes together. This bead is slid down the two suspension cords to the top of the inr&lt;U+014D&gt; to hold the stack together while the inr&lt;U+014D&gt; is worn, and slid up to the netsuke when the boxes need to be unstacked to access their contents. Inr&lt;U+014D&gt; were made of a variety of materials, including wood, ivory, bone, and lacquer. Lacquer was also used to decorate inro made of other materials.</p>
<p>Inr&lt;U+014D&gt;, like the <a href="ojime" class="uri" title="wikilink">ojime</a> and <a href="netsuke" class="uri" title="wikilink">netsuke</a> they were associated with, evolved over time from strictly utilitarian articles into objects of high art and immense craftsmanship.</p>
