<p>In traditional belief and <a href="fiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiction</a>, a <strong>ghost</strong> (sometimes known as a <strong>spectre</strong> (British English) or <strong>specter</strong> (American English), <strong>phantom</strong>, <strong>apparition</strong> or <strong>spook</strong>) is the <a href="Soul_(spirit)" title="wikilink">soul</a> or <a href="spirit" class="uri" title="wikilink">spirit</a> of a dead person or animal that can appear, in visible form or other manifestation, to the living. Descriptions of the <a href="Apparitional_experience" title="wikilink">apparition of ghosts</a> vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as <a href="necromancy" class="uri" title="wikilink">necromancy</a>, or in <a href="spiritism" class="uri" title="wikilink">spiritism</a> as a <em><a href="s&lt;U+00E9&gt;ance" class="uri" title="wikilink">s&lt;U+00E9&gt;ance</a></em>.</p>
<p>The belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread, dating back to <a href="animism" class="uri" title="wikilink">animism</a> or <a href="ancestor_worship" title="wikilink">ancestor worship</a> in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices&lt;U+2014&gt;funeral rites, <a href="exorcism" title="wikilink">exorcisms</a>, and some practices of <a href="spiritualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">spiritualism</a> and <a href="ritual_magic" title="wikilink">ritual magic</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular <a href="List_of_reportedly_haunted_locations" title="wikilink">locations</a>, objects, or people they were associated with in life, though stories of phantom armies, <a href="Ghost_train_(folklore)" title="wikilink">ghost trains</a>, <a href="List_of_ghost_ships" title="wikilink">phantom ships</a>, and even ghost <a href="animal" title="wikilink">animals</a> have also been recounted.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>The English word <em><a href=":wikt:ghost" title="wikilink">ghost</a></em> continues <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <em><a href=":wikt:gast#Old_English" title="wikilink">g&lt;U+00E1&gt;st</a></em>, from a hypothetical <a href="Common_Germanic" title="wikilink">Common Germanic</a> <em>*gaistaz</em>. It is common to <a href="West_Germanic" title="wikilink">West Germanic</a>, but lacking in North and East Germanic (the equivalent word in <a href="Gothic_language" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> is <em>ahma</em>, <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> has <em>andi</em> m., <em>&lt;U+00F6&gt;nd</em> f.). The pre-Germanic form was <em></em>, apparently from a root denoting &quot;fury, anger&quot; reflected in Old Norse <em>geisa</em> &quot;to rage&quot;. The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter <em>s</em>-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the <a href="mind" class="uri" title="wikilink">mind</a>, in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare <em><a href="&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r</a></em>). In <a href="Germanic_paganism" title="wikilink">Germanic paganism</a>, &quot;<a href="Germanic_Mercury" title="wikilink">Germanic Mercury</a>&quot;, and the later <a href="Odin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odin</a>, was at the same time the <a href="conductor_of_the_dead" title="wikilink">conductor of the dead</a> and the &quot;lord of fury&quot; leading the <a href="Wild_Hunt" title="wikilink">Wild Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Besides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin <em><a href="spirit" title="wikilink">spiritus</a></em> also in the meaning of &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;blast&quot; from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, i.e. angels and demons; the <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> gospel refers to the <a href="demonic_possession" title="wikilink">demonic possession</a> of Matthew 12:43 as <em>se uncl&lt;U+00E6&gt;na gast</em>. Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, viz. the &quot;<a href="Holy_Ghost" title="wikilink">Holy Ghost</a>&quot;. The now prevailing sense of &quot;the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form&quot; only emerges in <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> (14th century). The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;<a href="vital_principle" title="wikilink">vital principle</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="mind" class="uri" title="wikilink">mind</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="psyche_(psychology)" title="wikilink">psyche</a>&quot;, the seat of feeling, thought and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, fuzzy or unsubstantial image, in optics, photography and cinematography especially a flare, secondary image or spurious signal.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The synonym <em><a href=":wikt:spook" title="wikilink">spook</a></em> is a <a href="Dutch_language" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> loanword, akin to <a href="Low_German" title="wikilink">Low German</a> <em>sp&lt;U+00F4&gt;k</em> (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via the <a href="American_English" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the 19th century.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Alternative words in modern usage include <em>spectre</em> (from Latin <em>spectrum</em>), the Scottish <em>wraith</em> (of obscure origin), <em>phantom</em> (via French ultimately from Greek <em><a href="Phantasma_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">phantasma</a></em>, compare <em><a href=":wikt:fantasy" title="wikilink">fantasy</a></em>) and <em>apparition</em>. The term <em><a href="shade_(mythology)" title="wikilink">shade</a></em> in <a href="classical_mythology" title="wikilink">classical mythology</a> translates Greek &lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or Latin <em>umbra</em>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> in reference to the notion of spirits in the <a href="Greek_underworld" title="wikilink">Greek underworld</a>. &quot;Haint&quot; is a synonym for ghost used in regional English of the southern United States,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the &quot;haint tale&quot; is a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The term <em><a href="poltergeist" class="uri" title="wikilink">poltergeist</a></em> is a German word, literally a &quot;noisy ghost&quot;, for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href=":wikt:wraith" title="wikilink">Wraith</a></em> is a <a href="Scots_language" title="wikilink">Scots</a> word for &quot;ghost&quot;, &quot;spectre&quot; or &quot;apparition&quot;. It came to be used in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of &quot;portent&quot; or &quot;<a href="omen" class="uri" title="wikilink">omen</a>&quot;. In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it was also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; the <em><a href="OED" class="uri" title="wikilink">OED</a></em> notes &quot;of obscure origin&quot; only.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> An association with the verb <em><a href=":wikt:writhe" title="wikilink">writhe</a></em> was the etymology favored by <a href="J._R._R._Tolkien" title="wikilink">J.

<p>A <em><a href="Revenant_(folklore)" title="wikilink">revenant</a></em> is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated (&quot;<a href="undead" class="uri" title="wikilink">undead</a>&quot;) corpse.

<p>In many cultures malignant, restless ghosts are distinguished from the more benign spirits involved in <a href="ancestor_worship" title="wikilink">ancestor worship</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Ancestor worship typically involves rites intended to prevent <a href="Revenant_(folklore)" title="wikilink">revenants</a>, <a href="vengeful_spirit" title="wikilink">vengeful spirits</a> of the dead, imagined as starving and envious of the living. Strategies for preventing revenants may either include <a href="sacrifice" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacrifice</a>, i.e., giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return. Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese <a href="Ghost_Festival" title="wikilink">Ghost Festival</a> or the Western <a href="All_Souls&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">All Souls' Day</a>. Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world's <a href="burial_custom" title="wikilink">burial customs</a>.

<p>Nineteenth-century <a href="anthropologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropologist</a> <a href="James_Frazer" title="wikilink">James Frazer</a> stated in his classic work, <em><a href="The_Golden_Bough" title="wikilink">The Golden Bough</a></em>, that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ghosts-and-the-afterlife">Ghosts and the afterlife</h3>


<p>Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it appears to have been widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the <em><a href="Egyptian_Book_of_the_Dead" title="wikilink">Egyptian Book of the Dead</a></em>, which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.</p>
<h3 id="fear-of-ghosts">Fear of ghosts</h3>

This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern <a href="ghost_story" title="wikilink">ghost story</a>, <a href="Gothic_horror" title="wikilink">Gothic horror</a>, and other <a href="horror_fiction" title="wikilink">horror fiction</a> dealing with the supernatural.</p>
<h3 id="common-attributes">Common attributes</h3>
<p>Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. <a href="Anthropology" title="wikilink">Anthropologists</a> link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of &quot;breath&quot; in certain languages, such as the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>spiritus</em> and the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <em><a href="pneuma" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneuma</a></em>, which by <a href="analogy" class="uri" title="wikilink">analogy</a> became extended to mean the soul. In the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> is depicted as synthesising <a href="Adam_(Bible)" title="wikilink">Adam</a>, as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.</p>
<p>In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance (<a href="vengeful_ghost" title="wikilink">vengeful ghosts</a>), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or &quot;<a href="Doppelg&lt;U+00E4&gt;nger" title="wikilink">fetch</a>&quot; is a related omen of death.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="White_Lady_(ghost)" title="wikilink">White ladies</a> were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;. They are often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a <a href="banshee" class="uri" title="wikilink">banshee</a>.</p>
<p>Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the <em><a href="Flying_Dutchman" title="wikilink">Flying Dutchman</a></em>. This theme has been used in literature in <em><a href="The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner" title="wikilink">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></em> by Coleridge.</p>

<p>A place where ghosts are reported is described as <a href="List_of_reportedly_haunted_locations" title="wikilink">haunted</a>, and often seen as being inhabited by <a href="Soul_(spirit)" title="wikilink">spirits</a> of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide &lt;U+2014&gt; sometimes in the recent or ancient past. But not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and <a href="religion" title="wikilink">religions</a> believe the essence of a being, such as the '<a href="Soul_(spirit)" title="wikilink">soul</a>', continues to exist. Some religious views argue that the 'spirits' of those who have died have not 'passed over' and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong.</p>

They traveled to the netherworld, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living. Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living.

Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 5th century BC, <a href="Classical_Greece" title="wikilink">classical Greek</a> ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice and libations, or they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were &lt;U+201C&gt;firmly invited to leave until the same time next year&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 5th century AD, the Christian priest <a href="Constantius_of_Lyon" title="wikilink">Constantius of Lyon</a> recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="middle-ages">Middle Ages</h3>
<p>Ghosts reported in <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval Europe</a> tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge their mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Most ghosts were souls assigned to <a href="Purgatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purgatory</a>, condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now &quot;heavy as a church tower&quot;. These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian age</a>, and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> hillfort, as at <a href="Wandlebury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wandlebury</a>, near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the <a href="Albigensian_Crusade" title="wikilink">Albigensian Crusade</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Gervase_of_Tilbury" title="wikilink">Gervase of Tilbury</a>, Marshal of <a href="Arles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arles</a>, wrote that the image of Guilhem, a boy recently murdered in the forest, appeared in his cousin's home in <a href="Beaucaire,_Gard" title="wikilink">Beaucaire</a>, near <a href="Avignon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avignon</a>. This series of &quot;visits&quot; lasted all of the summer. Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology. The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in <a href="Purgatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purgatory</a>, and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the <a href="Cathar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cathar</a> heretics, launched three years earlier. The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.</p>

Interpretations of how <em>bhoot</em>s come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to <a href="reincarnation" title="wikilink">transmigration</a>, non-being, <a href="nirvana" class="uri" title="wikilink">nirvana</a>, or heaven or hell, depending on tradition).

<p>There are many references to ghosts in Chinese culture. Even Confucius said, &quot;Respect ghosts and gods, but keep away from them.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>The ghosts take many forms, depending on how the person died, and are often harmful. Many Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and south-east Asia. Ghost beliefs are closely associated with traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in <a href="Taoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoism</a>.

<p>Many Chinese today believe it possible to contact the spirits of their ancestors through a medium, and that ancestors can help descendants if properly respected and rewarded. The annual <a href="ghost_festival" title="wikilink">ghost festival</a> is celebrated by Chinese around the world. On this day, ghosts and <a href="spiritual_being" title="wikilink">spirits</a>, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the <a href="Underworld" title="wikilink">lower realm</a>. Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts as well as modern literature and films.</p>

<p>In <a href="English_Renaissance_theater" title="wikilink">English Renaissance theater</a>, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet&lt;U+2019&gt;s father. Armor, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;d stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in <em>Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory</em>, point out, &quot;In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.&quot; An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that </p>

<p>Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy <em><a href="Ghostbusters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghostbusters</a></em>, <a href="ghost_hunting" title="wikilink">ghost hunting</a> became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in <a href="Reality_television" title="wikilink">reality television series</a>, such as <em><a href="Ghost_Adventures" title="wikilink">Ghost Adventures</a></em>, <em><a href="Ghost_Hunters" title="wikilink">Ghost Hunters</a></em>, <em><a href="Ghost_Hunters_International" title="wikilink">Ghost Hunters International</a></em>, <em><a href="Ghost_Lab" title="wikilink">Ghost Lab</a></em>, <em><a href="Most_Haunted" title="wikilink">Most Haunted</a></em> and <em><a href="A_Haunting" title="wikilink">A Haunting</a></em>. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as <em><a href="The_Ghost_Hunter" title="wikilink">The Ghost Hunter</a></em> and <em><a href="Ghost_Trackers" title="wikilink">Ghost Trackers</a></em>. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting &quot;how-to&quot; manuals.</p>
<p>The 1990s saw a return to classic &quot;gothic&quot; ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's <em><a href="The_Sixth_Sense" title="wikilink">The Sixth Sense</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Others_(2001_film)" title="wikilink">The Others</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="Asian_cinema" title="wikilink">Asian cinema</a> has also produced <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror films</a> about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film <em><a href="Ring_(film)" title="wikilink">Ringu</a></em> (remade in the US as <em><a href="The_Ring_(2002_film)" title="wikilink">The Ring</a></em> in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film <em><a href="The_Eye_(2002_film)" title="wikilink">The Eye</a></em>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> <a href="Indian_ghost_movies" title="wikilink">Indian ghost movies</a> are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film <em><a href="Chandramukhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chandramukhi</a></em> have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. They usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore, but in some cases are remakes of western films, such as <em><a href="Anjaane_(2005_film)" title="wikilink">Anjaane</a></em>, based on <a href="Alejandro_Amen&lt;U+00E1&gt;bar" title="wikilink">Alejandro Amen&lt;U+00E1&gt;bar</a>'s ghost story <em><a href="The_Others_(2001_film)" title="wikilink">The Others</a></em>.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as <em><a href="Supernatural_(U.S._TV_series)" title="wikilink">Supernatural</a></em>, <em><a href="Ghost_Whisperer" title="wikilink">Ghost Whisperer</a></em> and <em><a href="Medium_(TV_show)" title="wikilink">Medium</a></em>. In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as <em><a href="Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost" title="wikilink">Casper</a></em>, <em><a href="Danny_Phantom" title="wikilink">Danny Phantom</a></em>, and <em><a href="Scooby-Doo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scooby-Doo</a></em>. Various other television shows have depicted ghosts as well.</p>
<h2 id="metaphorical-usages">Metaphorical usages</h2>
<p><a href="Nietzsche" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nietzsche</a> argued that people generally wear prudent <a href="Persona_(psychology)" title="wikilink">masks</a> in company; but that an alternative strategy for social interaction is to present oneself as an absence, as a social ghost - &lt;U+201C&gt;One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> - something later echoed (if with a less positive spin) by <a href="C._G._Jung" title="wikilink">C.

<p><a href="Nick_Harkaway" title="wikilink">Nick Harkaway</a> considered that we all carry a host of ghosts in our heads, in the form of impressions of past acquaintances &lt;U+2013&gt; ghosts that represent our maps of other people in the world: our reference points.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Object_relations_theory" title="wikilink">Object relations theory</a> sees our personalities as formed by <a href="Splitting_(psychology)" title="wikilink">splitting off</a> aspects of ourselves we find incompatible; whereupon we may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of our alternate selves.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
