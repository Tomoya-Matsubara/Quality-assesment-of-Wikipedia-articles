<p>The <strong>Kennet and Avon Canal</strong> is a <a href="waterway" class="uri" title="wikilink">waterway</a> in southern England with an overall length of ,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> made up of two lengths of <a href="navigable_river" title="wikilink">navigable river</a> linked by a <a href="canal" class="uri" title="wikilink">canal</a>. The name is commonly used to refer to the entire length of the navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> to <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a> the waterway follows the natural course of the <a href="River_Avon,_Bristol" title="wikilink">River Avon</a> before the canal links it to the <a href="River_Kennet" title="wikilink">River Kennet</a> at <a href="Newbury,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Newbury</a>, and from there to <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a> on the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>. In all, the waterway incorporates more than 100 <a href="Lock_(water_transport)" title="wikilink">locks</a>.</p>
<p>The two river stretches were made navigable in the early 18th century, and the  canal section was constructed between 1794 and 1810. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the canal gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a>. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored in stages, largely by volunteers. After decades of dereliction and much restoration work, it was fully reopened in 1990. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been developed as a popular heritage tourism destination for boating, <a href="canoeing" class="uri" title="wikilink">canoeing</a>, <a href="fishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishing</a>, <a href="walking" class="uri" title="wikilink">walking</a>, and <a href="cycling" class="uri" title="wikilink">cycling</a>, and is also important for <a href="wildlife_conservation" title="wikilink">wildlife conservation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-plans">Early plans</h3>
<p>The idea of an east to west waterway link across southern England was first mentioned in <a href="Elizabethan_era" title="wikilink">Elizabethan</a> times, between 1558 and 1603,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to take advantage of the proximity of the rivers <a href="River_Avon,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Avon</a> and <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">Thames</a>, only  apart at their closest. Later, around 1626, <a href="Henry_Briggs_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Henry Briggs</a> made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig. He proposed a canal to connect them, but following Briggs' death in 1630 the plan was dropped. After the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a> four <a href="Bill_(proposed_law)" title="wikilink">bills</a> were presented to parliament, but all failed after opposition from gentry, farmers and traders worried about cheaper water transport reducing the value of fees on <a href="turnpike_road" title="wikilink">turnpike roads</a> they controlled, and cheaper produce from Wales undercutting locally produced food.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> and London was a hazardous sea route through the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a>. The small coastal <a href="sailing_ships" title="wikilink">sailing ships</a> of the day were often damaged by Atlantic storms, and risked being attacked by <a href="warships" class="uri" title="wikilink">warships</a> of the <a href="French_navy" title="wikilink">French navy</a> and <a href="privateers" class="uri" title="wikilink">privateers</a> during a succession of conflicts with France.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century. In 1723 the Kennet Navigation through <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a> opened. The Avon navigation from Bristol to Bath was opened in 1727; the first cargo of &quot;Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal&quot; reached Bath in December.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The two navigations were built to meet local needs independently of one another, but both under the supervision of surveyor and engineer <a href="John_Hore" title="wikilink">John Hore</a>. In 1788 the so-called &quot;Western Canal&quot; was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as <a href="Hungerford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungerford</a>, <a href="Marlborough,_Wiltshire" title="wikilink">Marlborough, Wiltshire</a>, <a href="Calne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calne</a>, <a href="Chippenham,_Wiltshire" title="wikilink">Chippenham</a> and <a href="Melksham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melksham</a>. The following year the engineers Barns, Simcock and Weston submitted a proposed route for this canal, although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. The name was changed from Western Canal to Kennet and Avon Canal to avoid confusion with the <a href="Grand_Western_Canal" title="wikilink">Grand Western Canal</a>, which was being proposed at the same time.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p><img src="John_Rennie_(Engineer).jpg" title="fig:Surveyor, John Rennie: portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn, 1810" alt="Surveyor, John Rennie: portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn, 1810" /> In 1793 a further survey was conducted by <a href="John_Rennie_(engineer)" title="wikilink">John Rennie</a>, and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through <a href="Great_Bedwyn" title="wikilink">Great Bedwyn</a>, <a href="Devizes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devizes</a>, <a href="Trowbridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trowbridge</a> and <a href="Newbury,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Newbury</a>. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by <a href="Charles_Dundas,_1st_Baron_Amesbury" title="wikilink">Charles Dundas</a>, and the company started to take <a href="Subscription_(finance)" title="wikilink">subscriptions</a> from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the <a href="Savernake_Forest" title="wikilink">Savernake Forest</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a> and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and the two were linked by an iron railway until the completion of Devizes Locks in 1810.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The canal opened in 1810 after 16 years of construction. Major structures included the <a href="Dundas_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Dundas</a> and <a href="Avoncliff_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Avoncliff</a> <a href="aqueducts" class="uri" title="wikilink">aqueducts</a>, the <a href="Bruce_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Bruce Tunnel</a> under Savernake Forest, and the <a href="pumping_station" title="wikilink">pumping stations</a> at <a href="Claverton_Pumping_Station" title="wikilink">Claverton</a> and <a href="Crofton_Pumping_Station" title="wikilink">Crofton</a>, needed to overcome water supply problems. The final engineering task was the completion of the <a href="Caen_Hill_Locks" title="wikilink">Caen Hill Locks</a> at Devizes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>
<p>In 1801, trade along the canal commenced, even though goods had to be unloaded at Foxhangers at the bottom of what is now <a href="Caen_Hill_Locks" title="wikilink">Caen Hill Locks</a>, transported up the hill by a <a href="horse-drawn_railway" title="wikilink">horse-drawn railway</a>, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks finally opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 9s 6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;6 3s to &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 per ton, and therefore trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000, of which &lt;U+00A3&gt;70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back over a period of time. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at &lt;U+00A3&gt;24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal, the majority of the tonnage being accounted for by coal and stone travelling via the <a href="Somerset_Coal_Canal" title="wikilink">Somerset Coal Canal</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The journey from Bath to Newbury took an average of three and a half days. By 1832, 300,000 tons of freight was being carried each year and, between 1825 and 1834, the company had an annual revenue of around &lt;U+00A3&gt;45,000.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="decline">Decline</h3>
<p><img src="Pillbox_alongside_the_canal_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1340793.jpg" title="fig:A Second World War pillbox near Kintbury" alt="A Second World War pillbox near Kintbury" /> The opening of the <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a> in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, even though the canal company lowered tariffs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1852 the railway company took over the canal's operation, levying high tolls at every <a href="toll_point" title="wikilink">toll point</a> and reducing the amount spent on maintenance. Ice-breaking was stopped before the winter of 1857, and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal. In 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night, and, in 1865, boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss. By 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360,610 in 1848 to 210,567. In the 1870s <a href="water_abstraction" title="wikilink">water abstraction</a> from the canal near <a href="Fobney_Lock" title="wikilink">Fobney Lock</a> followed the regulations introduced in the Reading Local Board Waterworks, Sewerage, Drainage and Improvements Act of 1870, and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal. Several wharves and stretches of towpath were closed. In 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,920 and never subsequently made any profit.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Somerset_Coal_Canal" title="wikilink">Somerset Coal Canal</a> and <a href="Wilts_and_Berks_Canal" title="wikilink">Wilts and Berks Canal</a>, which each supplied some of the trade from the <a href="Somerset_coalfield" title="wikilink">Somerset coalfield</a> to the Kennet and Avon,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following a loss of &lt;U+00A3&gt;18,041 the previous year,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Second World War a large number of <a href="concrete" class="uri" title="wikilink">concrete</a> <a href="bunker" title="wikilink">bunkers</a> known as <a href="Bunker#Pillbox" title="wikilink">pillboxes</a> were built as part of the <a href="GHQ_Line" title="wikilink">GHQ Line</a> to <a href="British_anti-invasion_preparations_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">defend against an expected German invasion</a>, many of which are still visible along the banks of the canal.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After the war the Transport Act of 1947 meant that control of the canal passed to the <a href="British_Transport_Commission" title="wikilink">British Transport Commission</a>, but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the <a href="Avoncliff_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Avoncliff Aqueduct</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="closure-avoided">Closure avoided</h3>
<p><img src="Dundas.bridge.arp.jpg" title="fig:Dundas Aqueduct near Limpley Stoke" alt="Dundas Aqueduct near Limpley Stoke" /> A group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the <a href="Inland_Waterways_Association" title="wikilink">Inland Waterways Association</a>, with which it was subsequently merged. In 1955 John Gould, a trader on the eastern section of the waterway, successfully petitioned against the commission's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business. In March 1956 a clause in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was presented to parliament that would have removed the right of navigation between Reading and Bath. The Act was opposed by Gould and by the local authorities along the canal.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> They were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the Queen, brought to London from Bristol by water, although parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This campaign led to an inquiry by a Parliamentary <a href="Select_committee_(Westminster_system)" title="wikilink">Select Committee</a>. The committee supported the suspension of the right of navigation, and the Bill passed through the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> but was amended by the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> to include a clause to enforce &quot;no further deterioration&quot;. In July 1958, the Bowes Committee published their <em>Inquiry into Inland Waterways</em> which specifically mentioned the Kennet and Avon finding &quot;no justification for restoring the section from Reading to Bath&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>A government <a href="white_paper" title="wikilink">white paper</a> followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that were no longer able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated &lt;U+00A3&gt;20,000 for maintenance and &lt;U+00A3&gt;20,000 to begin restoration.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The <a href="Kennet_and_Avon_Canal_Trust" title="wikilink">Kennet and Avon Canal Trust</a> was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained <a href="Charitable_organization" title="wikilink">charitable status</a> in April and was incorporated under the <a href="Companies_Act_1948" title="wikilink">Companies Act</a> on 6 June 1962.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1963 the newly formed <a href="British_Waterways" title="wikilink">British Waterways</a>, which was created by the <a href="Transport_Act_1962" title="wikilink">Transport Act</a> of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statuary body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and <a href="riparian" class="uri" title="wikilink">riparian</a> local authorities, restoration work began.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="restoration">Restoration</h3>
<p><img src="Devizeslockspreresotoration.jpg" title="fig:Caen Hill Locks in the 1970s" alt="Caen Hill Locks in the 1970s" /> Restoration work involved a collaboration between staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 <a href="Sulhamstead_Lock" title="wikilink">Sulhamstead Lock</a> was rebuilt and the <a href="Puddling_(engineering)" title="wikilink">re-puddling</a> of the dry section at <a href="Limpley_Stoke" title="wikilink">Limpley Stoke</a> was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the <a href="Bath_Locks" title="wikilink">Bath Locks</a> and <a href="Burghfield_Lock" title="wikilink">Burghfield Lock</a>. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from  to  by strengthening girders added to the underside of the bridge.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This was replaced with a new bridge enabling craft to pass more easily.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Re-puddling was a long process therefore experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken. The <a href="Avoncliff_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Avoncliff Aqueduct</a> was lined with a concrete &quot;cradle&quot; and made water-tight in 1980.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Further works continued through the 1980s. The County Council in <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>, supported by local councils, estimated that &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges. In <a href="Wiltshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a> concerns over the limited water supply to the <a href="Route_summit" title="wikilink">summit</a>, at the highest point of the canal, indicated that back-pumping would be required, which increased the estimated cost for the county to &lt;U+00A3&gt;761,560. The <a href="Wilton_Water" title="wikilink">Wilton Water</a> reservoir was estimated to produce less than  per day, and the Seend feeder only . <a href="Wessex_Water" title="wikilink">Wessex Water Authority</a> agreed to the extraction of  per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the costs of the pumps was &lt;U+00A3&gt;175,000.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Various fund-raising schemes, along with some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the <a href="Manpower_Services_Commission" title="wikilink">Manpower Services Commission</a>, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of <a href="Aldermaston_Lock" title="wikilink">Aldermaston Lock</a>, its adjacent wharf, and <a href="Widmead_Lock" title="wikilink">Widmead Lock</a>. The restoration of the <a href="Dundas_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Dundas Aqueduct</a> and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The <a href="National_Association_for_the_Care_and_Resettlement_of_Offenders" title="wikilink">National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders</a> sponsored a workshop, which opened in <a href="Shrivenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shrivenham</a> in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of <a href="Woolhampton_Lock" title="wikilink">Woolhampton Lock</a> was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds <a href="swing_bridge" title="wikilink">swing bridge</a> could not be opened and the restoration of <a href="Midgham_Lock" title="wikilink">Midgham Lock</a> had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds was carried out in 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided <a href="Monkey_Marsh_Lock" title="wikilink">Monkey Marsh Lock</a> proved difficult because of its status as a <a href="Scheduled_Ancient_Monument" title="wikilink">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Monkey_Marsh_Lock_-_geograph.org.uk_-_333244.jpg" title="fig:Monkey Marsh Lock" alt="Monkey Marsh Lock" /> The stretch between Reading and Newbury was finally completed on 17 July 1990; at a ceremony held at <a href="Monkey_Marsh_Lock" title="wikilink">Monkey Marsh Lock</a> several boats competed for the honour of becoming the first craft through. But concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when Queen <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a> formally reopened the canal on 8 August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust's boat <em>Rose of Hungerford</em> through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29 locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million. The pumps raise water  at a rate of  per hour (380 litres per second). In October 1996,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single <a href="National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">National Lottery</a> grant awarded by the <a href="Heritage_Lottery_Fund" title="wikilink">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, &lt;U+00A3&gt;25 million towards a &lt;U+00A3&gt;29 million project,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The restoration's completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from <a href="HRH_Prince_Charles" title="wikilink">HRH Prince Charles</a>,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004 the <a href="Dundas_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Dundas Aqueduct</a>, which had been relined with <a href="polythene" class="uri" title="wikilink">polythene</a> and <a href="concrete" class="uri" title="wikilink">concrete</a> in 1984<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a> with <a href="Bath_Stone" title="wikilink">Bath Stone</a> to match the original work.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" title="wikilink">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> designated the canal a national &quot;cruiseway&quot; as defined by the <a href="Transport_Act_1968" title="wikilink">Transport Act 1968</a>.
