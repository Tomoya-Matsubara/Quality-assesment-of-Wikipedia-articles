<p>&quot;<strong>Starvin' Marvin</strong>&quot; is the ninth episode of the <a href="South_Park_(season_1)" title="wikilink">first season</a> of the American animated television series <em><a href="South_Park" title="wikilink">South Park</a></em>. It originally aired on <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on November 19, 1997. In the episode, <a href="Eric_Cartman" title="wikilink">Cartman</a>, <a href="Kenny_McCormick" title="wikilink">Kenny</a>, <a href="Kyle_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Kyle</a> and <a href="Stan_Marsh" title="wikilink">Stan</a> send money to an African charity hoping to get a sports watch, but are instead sent an Ethiopian child whom they dub <a href="List_of_minor_characters_on_South_Park#Starvin&#39;_Marvin" title="wikilink">Starvin' Marvin</a>. Later, Cartman is accidentally sent to Ethiopia, where he learns activist <a href="Sally_Struthers" title="wikilink">Sally Struthers</a> is hoarding the charity's food for herself. In an accompanying subplot, after genetically engineered turkeys attack South Park residents, <a href="Chef_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">Chef</a> rallies the residents to fight back, in a parody of the film <em><a href="Braveheart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braveheart</a></em>.</p>
<p>The episode was written by series co-creator <a href="Trey_Parker" title="wikilink">Trey Parker</a>. It was directed by Parker, and was rated <a href="Television_content_rating_systems#United_States" title="wikilink">TV-MA</a> in the US. &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; was the first <em>South Park</em> <a href="Thanksgiving_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a> special. The episode simultaneously served as a satire on American indifference toward impoverished countries and the humanitarianism industry.</p>
<p>The episode received generally positive reviews and several commentators have described it as a classic <em>South Park</em> episode. According to <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Ratings</a>, it was viewed by about 2.2 million households during its original broadcast, which at the time was roughly eight times Comedy Central's average viewership. Parker and Stone said they were unhappy with the turkey subplot, which they wrote only because they felt obligated to include a <a href="subplot" title="wikilink">B story</a>. Sally Struthers was reportedly deeply offended by her portrayal in the episode. In addition to Starvin' Marvin, who became a popular minor character, the episode introduced regular characters <a href="Gerald_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Gerald Broflovski</a> (Kyle's father) and Kenny's family members <a href="Stuart_and_Carol_McCormick" title="wikilink">Stuart, Carol</a> and <a href="List_of_South_Park_families#Kevin_McCormick" title="wikilink">Kevin McCormick</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>After seeing a commercial about starving children in Africa, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan send money to Sally Struthers' charity organization, the <a href="Christian_Children&#39;s_Fund" title="wikilink">Christian Children's Fund</a>. They do not care about the cause, but want the free sports watch that comes with the sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin. Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist <a href="List_of_South_Park_residents#Dr._Alphonse_Mephisto_and_Kevin" title="wikilink">Dr. Mephisto</a> tries to warn <a href="List_of_South_Park_residents#Mayor_McDaniels" title="wikilink">Mayor McDaniels</a> that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.</p>
<p>The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, where he is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume compared to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, <a href="Herbert_Garrison" title="wikilink">Mr. Garrison</a> announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought in only a few cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during <a href="Show_and_tell_(education)" title="wikilink">show and tell</a>, after which Mr. Garrison and <a href="List_of_staff_at_South_Park_Elementary#Principal_Victoria" title="wikilink">Principal Victoria</a> tell the boys they will have to call <a href="International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">Red Cross</a> and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a> is growing so rapidly that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.</p>
<p>The <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">FBI</a> arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks them into taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had previously cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there. While praying to God, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief fight, the Ethiopians take control of the food supply.</p>
<p>Back in South Park, Chef rallies the townspeople to fight the genetically engineered turkeys. A massive battle ensues in which Kenny is killed, but eventually the South Park residents kill all the turkeys and claim victory. The FBI returns Cartman to South Park and takes Marvin home, but not before he brings the bodies of the dead turkeys back to Ethiopia for everyone to eat.</p>

Directed by Parker, it was the first official <em>South Park</em> <a href="Thanksgiving_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving</a> episode. Parker and Stone said &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot;, like other holiday episodes, proved difficult to make because they felt a responsibility to constantly top other previous holiday shows. Stone provided the voice of Marvin.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to the official <em>South Park</em> website, the character was not named after the <a href="Starvin&#39;_Marvin&#39;s" title="wikilink">Starvin' Marvin's</a> brand of American gas stations, and that the similarity between the two names is just a coincidence.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Jerry_Seinfeld" title="wikilink">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, comedian and star of the popular sitcom <em><a href="Seinfeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seinfeld</a></em>, contacted Parker and Stone and asked if he could record a guest voice performance because he was a fan of the show. Parker and Stone offered Seinfeld the throwaway background part of one of the turkeys, but Seinfeld's agent was &quot;a bit put off&quot; by the offer and did not accept.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode was partially inspired by the commercials for the <a href="Christian_Children&#39;s_Fund" title="wikilink">Christian Children's Fund</a>, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for starving children in Africa. Parker said he did not really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found it funny that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with &quot;people leaving tons of food on their plates&quot;,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die at the end of the episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Parker and Stone were unhappy with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt &quot;never really went anywhere&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and ended abruptly without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a <a href="subplot" title="wikilink">B story</a>, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they realized this was not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the &quot;payoff&quot; of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, they did not know how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, &quot;The turkeys were just an excuse to have the <em><a href="Braveheart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braveheart</a></em> sequence.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in <a href="widescreen" class="uri" title="wikilink">widescreen</a> aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult and took a long time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show before. Some of the characters in the far background were animated as gray and shadowy, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a &quot;lighting effect meaning we didn't want to draw all these people&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to Starvin' Marvin himself, the episode included the first appearances of several regular characters: Kyle's father <a href="Gerald_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Gerald Broflovski</a>, as well as <a href="Stuart_and_Carol_McCormick" title="wikilink">Stuart, Carol</a> and <a href="List_of_South_Park_families#Kevin_McCormick" title="wikilink">Kevin McCormick</a>, father, mother and brother (respectively) of Kenny, who were portrayed as incredibly poor and unhygienic.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During one scene, <a href="List_of_South_Park_families#Liane_Cartman" title="wikilink">Liane Cartman</a> refers to <a href="List_of_South_Park_families#Gerald_and_Sheila_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Kyle's mother</a> as &quot;Carol&quot;, even though she is referred to in previous and all future episodes by her correct name, Shelia. In another consistency error, the couple killed by the turkeys at Stark's Pond can be seen alive and unharmed during the turkey battle scene.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Psychologists Gilbert Reyes and Gerard Jacobs have cited &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; as one example of popular culture voicing criticisms of <a href="humanitarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanitarianism</a> &quot;as an overblown industry leeching off others' suffering and harming its purported beneficiaries&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The episode also highlights America's <a href="consumerism" title="wikilink">consumerist</a> society and American indifference toward impoverished countries.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The moral of the episode, explained by Stan in the final scene, encourages viewers to see suffering citizens of impoverished countries as real people, rather than images on television screens, which tend to make the viewers feel detached and alienated from them.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; explores and satirizes <a href="gluttony" class="uri" title="wikilink">gluttony</a> in the US, particular through its unflattering portrayal of Sally Struthers, who gorges on donated food meant for starving children.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The greed and wastefulness shown at the buffet scene, as well as Cartman's overall greediness and lack of understanding regarding the plight of starving African children, has been said to demonstrate an over-abundance and decadence typically associated with Americans.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The destructive rampage of the turkeys provides a commentary on <a href="genetic_engineering" title="wikilink">genetic engineering</a>. Scott Calef, a philosophy professor who studies popular culture, said the destruction sown by the turkeys, despite the best of intentions by Dr. Mephisto, are indicative of the unpredictable nature and ethical ambiguity of the use of genetic engineering for the betterment of humankind.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>During class, Mr. Garrison incorrectly tells the children the internationally known British pop singer <a href="Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)" title="wikilink">Engelbert Humperdinck</a> was the first man to walk on the moon. Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, &quot;Well then perhaps they'd better do it, and decrease the surplus population!&quot; The line is lifted word-for-word from the <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> novella <em><a href="A_Christmas_Carol" title="wikilink">A Christmas Carol</a></em>, prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, &quot;Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day.&quot; Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on <em><a href="Full_House" title="wikilink">Full House</a></em>, an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series <em><a href="All_in_the_Family" title="wikilink">All in the Family</a></em>.

<p>Tom Vogt, who served as the editor of <em>South Park</em> for several years, was inspired to join the show after watching a bootleg copy of &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot;.

<h2 id="release-and-reception">Release and reception</h2>
<p>&quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; first aired in the United States on Comedy Central on November 19, 1997. The episode was rated <a href="Television_content_rating_systems#United_States" title="wikilink">TV-MA</a> in the US and a <a href="British_Board_of_Film_Classification" title="wikilink">PG</a> in the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In its original American broadcast, &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; received a <a href="Nielsen_Rating" title="wikilink">Nielsen Rating</a> of 4.8, meaning the episode was seen by about 2.2 million households in the US. Television journalists described the rating as &quot;astonishing&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> by Comedy Central standards; at the time, the network averaged a 0.6 rating (276,000 households) during prime time, and prior to <em>South Park</em>, the channel's highest rating was a 2.7 (1.24 million households) for the second season premiere of <em><a href="Absolutely_Fabulous" title="wikilink">Absolutely Fabulous</a></em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Several reviewers have described &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; as one of <em>South Park</em>'s &quot;classic episodes&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Parker said the emotional moment when Starvin' Marvin returned home with all the turkeys made his mother cry, marking the first time he and Stone heard of an emotional reaction to their show.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>After the episode aired, Parker and Stone received feedback that audiences felt &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; was especially unkind to Struthers. Although they did not speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was a fan of the show until &quot;Starvin' Marvin&quot; aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the <a href="South_Park_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third season</a> episode &quot;<a href="Starvin&#39;_Marvin_in_Space" title="wikilink">Starvin' Marvin in Space</a>&quot; as a <a href="Jabba_the_Hutt" title="wikilink">Jabba the Hutt</a>-like creature. In a <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, &quot;Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [starving children]. ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the <a href="Twinkie" title="wikilink">Twinkies</a> a little bit before going on the air.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
