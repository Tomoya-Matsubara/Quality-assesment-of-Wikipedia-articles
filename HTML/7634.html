<h2 id="storyline-details">Storyline Details</h2>
<p>When we meet Sara Janning she is an adult living on the planet Serevan. She has been hiding from the Chimerian Imperium ever since the Yamivol incident.</p>
<h3 id="the-yamivol-incident">The Yamivol Incident</h3>
<p>Sara grew up on an agricultural outpost on Yamivol Prime, a world that remained unaffiliated from the Chimerian Imperium for many years. Yamivol Prime was targeted for habitation by Chimerian forces when Sara was at a young age. Her home was destroyed, her family killed and just as she arrives to find all this her dog is vaporized before her very eyes. The trauma from this event causes Sara to release the power of her Sigil which wipes out all the Chimeran forces on Yamivol Prime. It is unknown whether Sara already had her Sigil at this point or whether it was activated during the Yamivol incident. The latter is most likely.</p>
<h3 id="serevan">Serevan</h3>
<p>Sara has been living on Serevan for a number of years hiding from the Imperium. There she works, cutting gigantic blocks of out of the ice. Upon returning from a hard days work Sara is approached by a new arrival to the planet, Jason Bryce. After a rather intense conversation the two part ways. It is possible that Jason Byrce was either one of the <a href="The_First_(comics)" title="wikilink">First</a> or an aspect of <a href="Danik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danik</a>.</p>
<p>Sara returns home to where a scientist, Isaiah, has been working on a robot, called a <a href="Carapoid_(Chimera)" title="wikilink">Carapoid</a>. Left over by an ancient race called <a href="The_Progenitors_(Chimera)" title="wikilink">The Progenitors</a>, Sara treats it as a pet of sorts naming it Rover. It is also revealed that Isaiah was the one who provided Sara with a masking device to hide her DNA from the Imperium.</p>
<p>The next day when clocking in for work Sara is again approached by Jason Bryce. When clocking in Bryce&lt;U+2019&gt;s DNA is picked up by the Chimeran Imperium. This results in a fleet being mobilized by the Chimeran Imperium which heads directly to Serevan.</p>
<p>Unaware of the approaching fleet Sara heads out onto the ice with Jason Bryce as a partner. While searching for <em>Tritium</em> Rover unexpectantly unleashes a laser from its optical. As the laser begins to burn a hole in the ice the ground starts to shake. With the ground giving way trio fall into a dark hole. When they awake they find themselves in front of a buried ship, later revealed to be a ship of The Progenitors.</p>
