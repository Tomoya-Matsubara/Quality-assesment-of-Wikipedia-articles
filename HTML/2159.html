<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>The teachers of Crestwood High School have been accused, by students,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> of imposing socialist and/or unionist beliefs upon students, with the accounts of students recalling members of staff despising those of a conservative political background. It would appear that the higher administrative staff attempt to ensure that political correctness is upheld, with entire days planned to celebrate <a href="multiculturalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">multiculturalism</a> and respect. While it is true that Crestwood High is a multicultural school, with some 42% of attendees coming from a language background other than English<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, some reports<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> claim that those of <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South Asian</a> descent feel disadvantaged within the school, with racial tensions remaining at an unsustainable level.</p>
