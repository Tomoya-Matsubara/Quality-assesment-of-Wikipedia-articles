<p><strong>&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus son of Fergus</strong> (<a href="Pictish_language" title="wikilink">Hypothetical Pictish form</a>: <em>Onuist map Urguist</em>;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Old_Irish_language" title="wikilink">Old Irish</a>: <em>&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus mac Fergusso</em>, Anglicisation: <em>Angus mac Fergus</em>), was <a href="king_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">king of the Picts</a> from 732 until his death in 761. His reign can be reconstructed in some detail from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus became the chief king in Pictland following a period of civil war in the late 720s. During his reign, the neighbouring kingdom of <a href="D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_Riata" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata</a> was subjugated and the <a href="kingdom_of_Strathclyde" title="wikilink">kingdom of Strathclyde</a> was attacked with less success. The most powerful ruler in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> for over two decades, he was involved in wars in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. Kings from &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's family dominated Pictland until 839 when a disastrous defeat at the hands of <a href="Vikings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vikings</a> began a new period of instability, which ended with the coming to power of <a href="Kenneth_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Cin&lt;U+00E1&gt;ed mac Ailp&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sources-and-background">Sources and background</h2>
<p>Surviving Pictish sources for the period are few, limited to king lists, the original of which was prepared in the early 720s,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and a number of accounts relating to the foundation of <a href="St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St Andrews</a>, then called Cennr&lt;U+00ED&gt;gmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the <a href="Irish_annals" title="wikilink">Irish annals</a>, of which the <em><a href="Annals_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Annals of Ulster</a></em> and the <em><a href="Annals_of_Tigernach" title="wikilink">Annals of Tigernach</a></em> are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of <a href="Iona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iona</a> in Scotland. &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus and the Picts appear occasionally in <a href="Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh</a> sources, such as the <em><a href="Annales_Cambriae" title="wikilink">Annales Cambriae</a></em>, and more frequently in <a href="Northumbria" title="wikilink">Northumbrian</a> sources, of which the Continuation of <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>'s chronicle and the <em>Historia Regum Anglorum</em> attributed to <a href="Symeon_of_Durham" title="wikilink">Symeon of Durham</a> are the most important.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Picts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picts</a> were one of four political groups in north <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Britain</a> in the early 8th century. Pictland ran from the <a href="River_Forth" title="wikilink">River Forth</a> northwards, including <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, <a href="Shetland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shetland</a> and the <a href="Western_Isles" title="wikilink">Western Isles</a>. Prior to the <a href="Viking_Age" title="wikilink">Viking Age</a>, the main power in Pictland appears to have been the kingdom of <a href="Fortriu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fortriu</a>. Known high-status sites in Fortriu include <a href="Burghead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burghead</a> and Craig Ph&lt;U+00E1&gt;draig by <a href="Inverness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inverness</a>. Pictland appears to have had only one bishop with his seat at <a href="Rosemarkie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosemarkie</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>From the Forth south to the <a href="River_Humber" title="wikilink">River Humber</a> lay the kingdom of <a href="Northumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northumbria</a>. Once the dominant force in Britain, it remained a powerful kingdom, but the end of the old dynasty of kings with the death of <a href="Osric_of_Northumbria" title="wikilink">Osric</a> in 729 led to conflict between rival families for the throne. The growing power of the <a href="Mercia" title="wikilink">Mercian</a> kingdom to the south added to the problems faced by Northumbrian kings. For most of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's reign Northumbria was ruled by the capable King <a href="Eadberht_of_Northumbria" title="wikilink">Eadberht Eating</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>To the south-west of Pictland were the <a href="Gaels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaels</a> of <a href="D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_Riata" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata</a> where the kingship was disputed between the <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_Loairn" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Loairn</a> of northern <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a> and the <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in</a> of <a href="Kintyre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kintyre</a>.

D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal and Eochaid were still in conflict as late as 731, when D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal burnt <a href="Tarbert,_Argyll_and_Bute" title="wikilink">Tarbert</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The history of the fourth group, the <a href="Brythons" title="wikilink">Britons</a> of <a href="Alt_Clut" title="wikilink">Alt Clut</a>, later the kingdom of Strathclyde, leaves little trace in the record. King <a href="Teudebur_of_Alt_Clut" title="wikilink">Teudebur map Beli</a> had ruled from <a href="Dumbarton_Rock" title="wikilink">Dumbarton Rock</a> since 722, and continued to do so until his death in 752 when his son <a href="Dumnagual_III_of_Alt_Clut" title="wikilink">Dumnagual</a> succeeded him.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Irish genealogies make &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus a member of the <a href="E&lt;U+00F3&gt;ganachta" class="uri" title="wikilink">E&lt;U+00F3&gt;ganachta</a> of <a href="Munster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munster</a>, as a descendant of Coirpre Cruthnech&lt;U+00E1&gt;n or &quot;Cairbre the little Pict&quot;, a mythological emanation or double of <a href="Coirpre_Luachra_mac_Cuirc" title="wikilink">Coirpre Luachra mac Cuirc</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> legendary son of <a href="Conall_Corc" title="wikilink">Conall Corc</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and ancestor of the <a href="E&lt;U+00F3&gt;ganacht_Locha_L&lt;U+00E9&gt;in" title="wikilink">E&lt;U+00F3&gt;ganacht Locha L&lt;U+00E9&gt;in</a>, rulers of the kingdom of <a href="Iarmuman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iarmuman</a>.

<p>King <a href="Nechtan_IV_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Nechtan son of Der-Ile</a> abdicated to enter a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his successor <a href="Drest_VII_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Drest</a> in 726. In 728 and 729, four kings competed for power in Pictland: Drest; Nechtan; <a href="Alp&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_I_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Alp&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>, of whom little is known; and lastly &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, who was a partisan of Nechtan, and perhaps his acknowledged heir.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Four battles large enough to be recorded in Ireland were fought in 728 and 729. Alp&lt;U+00ED&gt;n was defeated twice by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, after which Nechtan was restored to power. In 729 a battle between supporters of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus and Nechtan's enemies was fought at Monith Carno (traditionally Cairn o' Mount, near <a href="Fettercairn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fettercairn</a>) where the supporters of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus were victorious. Nechtan was restored to the kingship, probably until his death in 732.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> On 12 August 729 &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus defeated and killed Drest in battle at Druimm Derg Blathuug, a place which has not been identified.</p>

<p>In the 730s, &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus fought against <a href="D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_Riata" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata</a> whose traditional overlords and protectors in Ireland, the <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_Conaill" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Conaill</a>, were much weakened at this time.

The <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_Loairn" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Loairn</a> of north <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a> were ruled by <a href="D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal_mac_Selbaig" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal mac Selbaig</a> whom Eochaid had deposed as overking of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata in the 720s.</p>
<p>Fighting between the Picts, led by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's son Bridei, and the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, led by Talorgan mac Congussa, is recorded in 731. In 733, D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal mac Selbaig &quot;profaned [the sanctuary] of <a href="Tory_Island" title="wikilink">Tory Island</a> when he dragged Bridei out of it.&quot; D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal, previously deposed as overking of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, was overthrown as king of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Loairn and replaced by his first cousin <a href="Muiredach_mac_Ainbcellaig" title="wikilink">Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The annals report a second campaign by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus against the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata in 736. D&lt;U+00FA&gt;ngal, who had returned from Ireland, and his brother Feradach, were captured and bound in chains. The fortresses of Creic and <a href="Dunadd" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunadd</a> were taken. Muiredach of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Loairn was no more successful, defeated with heavy loss by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's brother Talorgan, perhaps by <a href="Loch_Awe" title="wikilink">Loch Awe</a>. A final campaign in 741 saw the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata again defeated. This was recorded in the <em>Annals of Ulster</em> as <em>Percutio D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riatai la h-&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus m. Forggusso</em>, the &quot;smiting of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus son of Fergus&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With this D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata disappears from the record for a generation.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>It may be that &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus was involved in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, or against him as an ally of <a href="Cathal_mac_Finguine" title="wikilink">Cathal mac Finguine</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The evidence for such involvement is limited.

Less certainly, the <em><a href="Fragmentary_Annals_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Fragmentary Annals of Ireland</a></em> report the presence of a Pictish fleet from <a href="Fortriu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fortriu</a> fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="alt-clut-northumbria-and-mercia">Alt Clut, Northumbria, and Mercia</h2>
<p>In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported, during which <a href="Ethelbald_of_Mercia" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald</a>, King of <a href="Mercia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercia</a>, took advantage of the absence of <a href="Eadberht_of_Northumbria" title="wikilink">Eadberht of Northumbria</a> to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The reason for the war is unclear, but it has been suggested that it was related to the killing of Earnwine son of <a href="Eadwulf_of_Northumbria" title="wikilink">Eadwulf</a> on Eadberht's orders. Earnwine's father had been an exile in the north after his defeat in the civil war of 705&lt;U+2013&gt;706, and it may be that &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, or &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald, or both, had tried to place him on the Northumbrian throne.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <img src="Escomb_Church_(John_Phillips).jpg" title="fig:Escomb Church, County Durham.

<p>Battles between the Picts and the Britons of Alt Clut, or <a href="Kingdom_of_Strathclyde" title="wikilink">Strathclyde</a>, are recorded in 744 and again in 750, when <a href="Kyle,_Ayrshire" title="wikilink">Kyle</a> was taken from Alt Clut by Eadberht of Northumbria. The 750 battle between the Britons and the Picts is reported at a place named Mocetauc (perhaps Mugdock, near <a href="Milngavie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milngavie</a>) in which Talorgan the brother of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus was killed.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Following the defeat in 750, the <em>Annals of Ulster</em> record &quot;the ebbing of the sovereignty of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This is thought to refer to the coming to power of <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed_Find" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed Find</a>, son of Eochaid mac Echdach, in all or part of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, and his rejection of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's overlordship.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike the straightforward narrative of the attacks on D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, a number of interpretations have been offered of the relations between &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, Eadberht and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald in the period from 740 to 750. One suggestion is that &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald were allied against Eadberht, or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain, or <a href="bretwalda" title="wikilink">bretwaldaship</a>, &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus collecting tribute north of the <a href="River_Humber" title="wikilink">River Humber</a> and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald south of the Humber. This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham's <em>Historia Regum Anglorum</em>, and it has more recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by <a href="Frank_Stenton" title="wikilink">Frank Stenton</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;that it is based on a textual error and that &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship&lt;U+2014&gt;is the correct one.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In 756, &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus is found campaigning alongside Eadberht of Northumbria. The campaign is reported as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year of the Lord's incarnation 756, king Eadberht in the eighteenth year of his reign, and Unust, king of Picts led armies to the town of <a href="Dumbarton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dumbarton</a>. And hence the Britons accepted terms there, on the first day of the month of August. But on the tenth day of the same month perished almost the whole army which he led from Ouania to Niwanbirig.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Ouania is <a href="Govan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Govan</a> is now reasonably certain,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> but the location of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near <a href="Hexham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hexham</a> that has been the preferred location.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with <a href="Newborough,_Staffordshire" title="wikilink">Newborough</a> by <a href="Lichfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lichfield</a> in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to <a href="Saint_Andrew" title="wikilink">Saint Andrew</a> for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

The Irish annals report the death of &quot;Tuathal&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, abbot of Cinrigh M&lt;U+00F3&gt;na&quot;, in 747, making it certain that St Andrews had been founded before that date, probably by &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus or by Nechtan son of Der-Ilei.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It is generally presumed that the <a href="St_Andrews_Sarcophagus" title="wikilink">St Andrews Sarcophagus</a> was executed at the command of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Later generations may have conflated this king &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus with the 9th century <a href="&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus_II_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">king of the same name</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The choice of <a href="David" class="uri" title="wikilink">David</a> as a model is, as <a href="Alex_Woolf" title="wikilink">Alex Woolf</a> notes, an appropriate one: David too was an usurper.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The cult of <a href="Saint_Andrew" title="wikilink">Saint Andrew</a> may have come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the cult of <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Saint Peter</a> which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in particular from the <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> at <a href="Hexham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hexham</a> which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, like his successors and possible kinsmen <a href="Caustant&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Caustant&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a> and <a href="Uen_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">E&lt;U+00F3&gt;gan</a>, is recorded prominently in the <em>Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis</em>, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with <a href="Durham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durham</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and legacy</h2>
<p>&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus died in 761, &quot;aged probably more than seventy, ... the dominating figure in the politics of Northern Britain&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> His death is reported in the usual brief style by the annalists, except for the continuator of Bede in Northumbria, possibly relying upon a D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata source, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, king of the Picts, died. From the beginning of his reign right to the end he perpetrated bloody crimes, like a tyrannical slaughterer.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="Pictish_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Pictish Chronicle</a> king lists have it that he was succeeded by his brother <a href="Bridei_V_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Bridei</a>. His son <a href="Talorgan_II_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Talorgan</a> was later king, and is the first son of a Pictish king known to have become king.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The following 9th century Irish praise poem from the <a href="Book_of_Leinster" title="wikilink">Book of Leinster</a> is associated with &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus:<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good the day when &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus took Alba,<br />
hilly Alba with its strong chiefs;<br />
he brought battle to palisaded towns,<br />
with feet, with hands, with broad shields.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An assessment of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus is problematic, not least because annalistic sources provide very little information on Scotland in the succeeding generations. His apparent Irish links add to the long list of arguments which challenge the idea that the &quot;Gaelicisation&quot; of eastern Scotland began in the time of Cin&lt;U+00E1&gt;ed mac Ailp&lt;U+00ED&gt;n; indeed there are good reasons for believing that process began before &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus's reign.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Many of the Pictish kings until the death of <a href="Uen_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">E&lt;U+00F3&gt;gan mac &lt;U+00D3&gt;engusa</a> in 839 belong to the family of &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus, in particular the 9th century sons of Fergus, <a href="Caustant&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">Caustant&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a> and <a href="&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus_II_of_the_Picts" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D3&gt;engus</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The amount of information which has survived about &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus compared with other Pictish kings, the nature and geographical range of his activities and the length of his reign combine to make King &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus one of the most significant rulers of the insular Dark Ages.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn46">The strongest claims are made in those accounts which take &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus to have been joint Bretwalda with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbald, such as Charles-Edwards, Forsyth and Yorke. Other, such as Broun and Woolf, make less sweeping claims, but make &lt;U+00D3&gt;engus among the most powerful Pictish kings and the dominant force in northern Britain.
