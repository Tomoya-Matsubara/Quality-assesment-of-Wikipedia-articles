<p><strong>Long Churn Cave</strong> is a cave in the <a href="Ingleborough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ingleborough</a> area of the <a href="Yorkshire_Dales" title="wikilink">Yorkshire Dales</a> caving area. First explored in 1870, it has become a popular location for beginner cavers and it contains the most famous squeeze in the Dales, the &quot;Cheesepress&quot;. It is near Selside, about 15 km north of <a href="Ingleton,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Ingleton, North Yorkshire</a>. Access is by permission from the landowner at Selside Farm after payment of a nominal fee.</p>

<p>Created in limestone by the slow corrosion of slightly acidic rainwater over millions of years, the cave is split into two parts, &quot;Lower Long Churn&quot; and &quot;Upper Long Churn&quot;, each active with a stream and is connected to the nearby <a href="Alum_Pot" title="wikilink">Alum Pot</a> and <a href="Diccan_Pot" title="wikilink">Diccan Pot</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Upper Long Churn can be entered via descent of a  waterfall into &quot;Dr Bannister's Handbasin&quot;, a moderately deep pool of water, and comprises a single long passage.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Lower Long Churn leads to an exit into Diccan Pot, followed by the &quot;Cheesepress&quot;, a narrow squeeze which is notorious for its tightness but which can be bypassed.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The following part of the passage used to be aided by artificial aids (over the so-called &quot;Plank Pool&quot;) but is no longer. The end of the Lower Long Churn is a chamber which opens on a window into Alum Pot, which is much more technically difficult to descent (or ascend).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>
<p>The cave was first explored in 1870 by W. Boyd-Dawkins.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The system was written about by the outdoors author <a href="Alfred_Wainwright" title="wikilink">Alfred Wainwright</a>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is quite possible and in fact easy to die a horrible death by straying off route. The dangers of Alum Pot are manifestly obvious. Other deathtraps, unseen, occur in the black interiors of some of the caves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cave is commonly used as in introduction to caving for novice and inexperienced cavers, although in stormy weather it fills with water and can prove dangerous; in 2007 a man and woman both drowned in the same incident,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and in 2008 two separate groups were trapped in the cave during storms, although no lives were lost.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
