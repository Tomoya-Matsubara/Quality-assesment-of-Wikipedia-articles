<p>Charles Thompson was born in  on <a href="April_6" title="wikilink">April 6</a>, <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a>. His father was a bar owner, and Thompson first lived in  as a baby because his father wanted to &quot;learn more about the restaurant and bar business&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Thompson was introduced to music at a young age, as his parents listened to 1960s <a href="folk_rock" title="wikilink">folk rock</a>. His first guitar was his mother's, a <a href="Yamaha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yamaha</a> <a href="classical_guitar" title="wikilink">classical guitar</a> bought with money from his father's bar tips, which he started to play at age &quot;11 or 12&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Thompson's family moved around, first with his natural father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who &quot;pursued <a href="real_estate" title="wikilink">real estate</a> on both coasts&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined a church that was tied to the evangelical <a href="Assemblies_of_God" title="wikilink">Assemblies of God</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He discovered the music of <a href="Christian_rock" title="wikilink">Christian rock</a> <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Larry_Norman" title="wikilink">Larry Norman</a> at 13 when Norman played at a religious <a href="summer_camp" title="wikilink">summer camp</a> that Thompson attended. Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he named the Pixies' first <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a> and a lyric in the band's song &quot;Levitate Me&quot; after one of Norman's catchphrases, &quot;<a href="Come_on_Pilgrim" title="wikilink">come on, pilgrim</a>!&quot; Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Just before Thompson's senior year, his family moved to , where he received a <em>Teenager of the Year</em> award — the title of a later <a href="solo_album" title="wikilink">solo album</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_Your_Man" title="wikilink">Here Comes Your Man</a>&quot; from <em><a href="Doolittle_(album)" title="wikilink">Doolittle</a></em>, and &quot;Velvety Instrumental Version&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After graduating from high school in 1983, he studied in the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, majoring in anthropology.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a <a href="semester" class="uri" title="wikilink">semester</a> before moving in with future Pixies guitarist <a href="Joey_Santiago" title="wikilink">Joey Santiago</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The two shared an interest in <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a>, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a>; they began to jam together.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> It was at this time that Thompson discovered <a href="The_Cars" title="wikilink">The Cars</a>, a band he described as &quot;very influential on me and the Pixies&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Santiago later recalled his time in college:<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan</a>, <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a> as part of an <a href="Student_exchange_program" title="wikilink">exchange program</a>. He spent six months in an apartment with a &quot;weird, psycho, gay roommate&quot;, who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies' song &quot;<a href="Crackity_Jones" title="wikilink">Crackity Jones</a>&quot;;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to grasp the <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish language</a>, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> to view <a href="Halley&#39;s_Comet" title="wikilink">Halley's Comet</a> (he later said it &quot;seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time&quot;),<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> or start a <a href="rock_band" title="wikilink">rock band</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words &quot;we gotta do it, now is the time Joe&quot;,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Soon after arriving back in Massachusetts, Thompson dropped out of college, and moved to Boston with Santiago. He spent 1984 working in a warehouse, &quot;managing buttons on teddy bears&quot;, composing songs on his <a href="acoustic_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a>, and writing lyrics on the <a href="Subway_(rail)" title="wikilink">subway</a> train.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Late in 1985, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Early in 1986, bassist <a href="Kim_Deal" title="wikilink">Kim Deal</a> was recruited via a classified advert placed in a Boston paper, which requested a bassist &quot;into <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a> and <a href="Peter,_Paul_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>&quot;. Drummer <a href="Dave_Lovering" title="wikilink">Dave Lovering</a> was later hired on recommendation from Deal.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>       In 1987, the Pixies recorded an eighteen-track <a href="Demo_(music)" title="wikilink">demo tape</a>, commonly referred to as <em><a href="The_Purple_Tape" title="wikilink">The Purple Tape</a></em> amongst fans. Thompson's (natural) father assisted the band financially, loaning $1000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father &quot;wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best to make up for lost time&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <em>The Purple Tape</em> lead to a recording contract with the English independent record label <a href="4AD" class="uri" title="wikilink">4AD</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Thompson adopted the alias &quot;Black Francis&quot; for the release of <em><a href="Come_on_Pilgrim" title="wikilink">Come on Pilgrim</a></em>, a name inspired by his father: &lt;U+201C&gt;he had been saving that name in case he had another son&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1988, the Pixies recorded their second album <em><a href="Surfer_Rosa" title="wikilink">Surfer Rosa</a></em>. Francis wrote and sang on all the tracks, with the exception of the single &quot;<a href="Gigantic_(song)" title="wikilink">Gigantic</a>&quot;, which was co-written and sung by Deal. To support the album, the band undertook a European tour, during which Francis met <a href="Eric_Drew_Feldman" title="wikilink">Eric Drew Feldman</a>,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> a later collaborator on Pixies and solo albums. <em><a href="Doolittle_(album)" title="wikilink">Doolittle</a></em>, with Francis-written songs such as &quot;Debaser&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot;,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> was released the following year, to widespread critical acclaim.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> However, by this time, tensions between Francis and Deal combined with exhaustion, and led the band to announce a hiatus.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Francis has an aversion to flying, and spent this time driving across America with his girlfriend, Jean Walsh, performing solo shows in order to raise funds to buy furniture in his new <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> apartment.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The band reconvened in 1990, and recorded two further albums: 1990's <em><a href="Bossanova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bossanova</a></em> and 1991's <em><a href="Trompe_le_Monde" title="wikilink">Trompe le Monde</a></em>; the latter was Francis' first collaboration with Feldman. The later Pixies albums were characterized by Francis' increasing influence on the band's output, as well as a focus on <a href="science_fiction_themes" title="wikilink">science fiction themes</a>, including <a href="alien" title="wikilink">aliens</a> and <a href="UFOs" class="uri" title="wikilink">UFOs</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> These themes would continue to be explored throughout his early solo work. <em>Trompe le Monde</em> includes the song &quot;U-Mass&quot;, which was written about the university he attended as a youth, and due to the keyboard part played by Feldman, signified a move away from the band's purely alternative rock sound. Although Deal had contributed to previous albums, from <em>Bossanova</em> on, Francis wrote all the band's original material. This contributed to the increasing tension between Francis and Deal,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and the Pixies broke up in 1992; this was not publicly announced until early in 1993.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-solo-career">Early solo career</h3>
<p><img src="Frank_black_cover.jpg" title="fig:Frank Black (1993)" alt="Frank Black (1993)" width="200" /> While the Pixies' 1991 album <em>Trompe le Monde</em> was being recorded, Francis had discussions with the album's producer, <a href="Gil_Norton" title="wikilink">Gil Norton</a>, about a possible solo record.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a <a href="Cover_version" title="wikilink">cover album</a>. However, by the time Francis visited a <a href="recording_studio" title="wikilink">recording studio</a> again in 1992, he had &quot;plenty of tunes and musical scraps&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, <a href="The_Beach_Boys" title="wikilink">The Beach Boys</a>' &quot;<a href="Hang_on_to_Your_Ego" title="wikilink">Hang on to Your Ego</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a> on several songs,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> with Santiago featuring on lead guitar.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name &quot;Frank Black&quot; (inverting his old persona &quot;Black Francis&quot;) and released the results as <em><a href="Frank_Black_(album)" title="wikilink">Frank Black</a></em> in March 1993.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <em>Frank Black</em> was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other eclectic subjects, such as in &quot;I Heard Ramona Sing&quot;, a song about the <a href="Ramones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramones</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums <em>Bossanova</em> and <em>Trompe le Monde</em>. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with <em>Trompe le Monde</em>, &quot;but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Teenager_of_the_year_cover.jpg" title="fig:Teenager of the Year (1994)" alt="Teenager of the Year (1994)" width="200" /> The following year, Black released his second solo record, a quirky twenty-two song double album entitled <em><a href="Teenager_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Teenager of the Year</a></em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em>Teenager</em> included the song &quot;Headache&quot; (), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as &quot;irresistible pop&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The production of <em>Teenager of the Year</em> was markedly different to <em>Frank Black</em>; in the previous album, <a href="MIDI" class="uri" title="wikilink">MIDI</a> templates were used when writing songs, but in <em>Teenager</em>, Black showed individual parts to band members. Feldman noted that Black's songwriting became &quot;a lot more spontaneous&quot; while recording the album.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Black had begun to stray from his style with the Pixies, writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics, and his new-found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of <em>Frank Black</em> and <em>Trompe le Monde</em>.</p>
<p>Both <em>Frank Black</em> and <em>Teenager of the Year</em> were critically well-received and remain fan favorites, although they enjoyed little commercial success. In 1995, Black left his long-time labels <a href="4AD" class="uri" title="wikilink">4AD</a> and <a href="Elektra_Records" title="wikilink">Elektra</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Black continued to write new material: 1996 saw the release of <em><a href="The_Cult_of_Ray" title="wikilink">The Cult of Ray</a></em> on <a href="Rick_Rubin" title="wikilink">Rick Rubin</a>'s <a href="American_Recordings" title="wikilink">American Recordings</a>; the album marked a turn away from the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole <em>Teenager</em> holdover Lyle Workman on <a href="lead_guitar" title="wikilink">lead guitar</a>, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Black's working methods for the next several years.</p>
<h3 id="frank-black-and-the-catholics">Frank Black and the Catholics</h3>
<p><img src="Fbcs.jpg" title="fig:Frank Black and the Catholics (1997)" alt="Frank Black and the Catholics (1997)" width="200" /> Black dubbed this backing band &quot;the Catholics&quot;, and the band's eponymous album <em><a href="Frank_Black_and_the_Catholics_(album)" title="wikilink">Frank Black and the Catholics</a></em> was recorded in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, Black was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and was ultimately released in late 1998 by <a href="SpinArt_Records" title="wikilink">SpinArt Records</a> in the US.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Since leaving American, Black has avoided long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <em>Frank Black and the Catholics</em> became the first album to be posted to the <a href="eMusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">eMusic</a> service; they claim it is &quot;the first album ever made legally available for commercial download&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Critical reception to the album was mixed, with some writers noting Black's seemingly deliberate turn away from the &quot;quirkiness&quot; of the Pixies and his early solo work for a self-consciously straightforward approach,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and the &quot;disappointingly straightforward punk-pop&quot; musical style present on the album.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Black would continue to eschew <a href="multi-track_recording" title="wikilink">multi-track recording</a> for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name. Live-to-two-track recording precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done &quot;on the fly&quot;. On later albums, Black incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures. Explaining his rationale behind the method, Black commented:<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>By this time, whilst dismissing the possibility of a Pixies reunion, Black had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, <em><a href="Black_Letter_Days" title="wikilink">Black Letter Days</a></em> and <em><a href="Devil&#39;s_Workshop" title="wikilink">Devil's Workshop</a></em>, were released simultaneously in 2002.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <em>Devil's Workshop</em> included the song &quot;Velvety&quot; (), a version of the Pixies' song &quot;Velvety Instrumental Version&quot; (written by Black as a teenager) with lyrics.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The song was one of the first signs that Black had acknowledged his past work with the Pixies in his solo output. A sixth album with the Catholics, <em><a href="Show_Me_Your_Tears" title="wikilink">Show Me Your Tears</a></em>, was released in 2003. <em>Show Me Your Tears'</em> title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Black's recent <a href="divorce" class="uri" title="wikilink">divorce</a> and entry into <a href="psychotherapy" title="wikilink">therapy</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>In late 2003, following long-standing rumours, an official announcement was made that the Pixies were practising for a reunion tour.

<p><img src="Frank_Black_WF.jpg" title="fig:Black performing in 2005 at the San Diego Street Scene Festival" alt="Black performing in 2005 at the San Diego Street Scene Festival" width="300" /> Also in 2004, Black began to collaborate with a group of <a href="Nashville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> session men, including <a href="Steve_Cropper" title="wikilink">Steve Cropper</a>, <a href="Spooner_Oldham" title="wikilink">Spooner Oldham</a>, <a href="Reggie_Young" title="wikilink">Reggie Young</a>, and <a href="Anton_Fig" title="wikilink">Anton Fig</a>, as well as producer <a href="Jon_Tiven" title="wikilink">Jon Tiven</a>. In July 2005, the collective released <em><a href="Honeycomb_(album)" title="wikilink">Honeycomb</a></em> under the Frank Black name, to generally favorable reviews. <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> described the album as &quot;spare, graceful, [and] in the pocket&quot;, while <em>Billboard</em> noted it as &quot;One of his finest hours&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> A second volume of Nashville sessions, a <a href="double_album" title="wikilink">double album</a> entitled <em><a href="Fastman_Raiderman" title="wikilink">Fastman Raiderman</a></em>, was released in June <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Black appeared at a concert by Christian rock pioneer <a href="Larry_Norman" title="wikilink">Larry Norman</a> in June 2005 in <a href="Salem,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Salem, Oregon</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Norman and Black performed a duet on &quot;Watch What You're Doing&quot;, which later appeared on Norman's album, <em>Live at The Elsinore</em>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Black continued to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, March 2006 saw the release on the iTunes Music Store of two separate albums of the band's <a href="B-side" title="wikilink">B-sides</a> and rarities, <em>Snake Oil</em> and <em>One More Road for the Hit</em>, with an eye towards a future CD release. Black was also working on more new solo material with <a href="Eric_Drew_Feldman" title="wikilink">Eric Drew Feldman</a> in the first part of 2006, some of which has already been performed live with Feldman. In the fall of 2006, Black began his first solo tour since 2003.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In October 2006, Black announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, and to release a solo &quot;<a href="Greatest_hits" title="wikilink">Best Of</a>&quot; compilation next year.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In December 2006, Black released the internet-only &quot;Christmass&quot; album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from this tour that previous summer.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>Over the course of his career, Black's musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres; however, he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Whereas songs such as &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; (<em>Doolittle</em>), &quot;Velvety&quot; (<em>Devil's Workshop</em>) and &quot;Headache&quot; (<em>Teenager of the Year</em>) expose a more <a href="Soft_rock" title="wikilink">light rock</a> side, others such as &quot;Something Against You&quot; (<em>Surfer Rosa</em>) and &quot;Thalassocracy&quot; (<em>Teenager of the Year</em>) hint to a more <a href="Hard_rock" title="wikilink">heavy rock</a> influence in his material. A strong <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> influence is also increasingly evident in his style, most notably in his Nashville albums, <em>Honeycomb</em> and <em>Fastman Raiderman</em>.</p>
<p>Black acquired his trademark screaming as a teenager, when, according to Black, a Thai neighbor asked him to sing &quot;<a href="Oh!_Darling" title="wikilink">Oh! Darling</a>&quot; by <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> (from their album <em><a href="Abbey_Road_(album)" title="wikilink">Abbey Road</a></em>) and to &quot;Scream it like you hate that bitch!&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Black's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced <a href="verse" title="wikilink">verses</a> followed by thundering <a href="refrain" title="wikilink">chorus</a> lines and repetitive guitar <a href="staccato" class="uri" title="wikilink">staccato</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="influences">Influences</h3>
<p>Black has drawn influence from a number of <a href="Music_genre" title="wikilink">musical genres</a>. As a teenager, Black mostly listened to 1960's folk and religious music, including the <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Larry_Norman" title="wikilink">Larry Norman</a>. Later in high school and in college, he discovered <a href="Punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk music</a> (<a href="Black_Flag_(band)" title="wikilink">Black Flag</a>), along with bands from other genres, such as the <a href="New_Wave_music" title="wikilink">new wave</a> band <a href="The_Cars" title="wikilink">The Cars</a>. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, Black listened to <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a>'s <em><a href="Zen_Arcade" title="wikilink">Zen Arcade</a></em>, <em><a href="Spotlight_Kid" title="wikilink">Spotlight Kid</a></em> by <a href="Captain_Beefheart" title="wikilink">Captain Beefheart</a>, and <em>I'm Sick of You</em>, an <a href="Iggy_Pop" title="wikilink">Iggy Pop</a> bootleg.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> His choice of covers in his career reveals many influences, with songs such as <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>' &quot;<a href="Wild_Honey_Pie" title="wikilink">Wild Honey Pie</a>&quot; (from<em><a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink">The White Album</a></em>) and &quot;Head On&quot; (by <a href="The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain" title="wikilink">The Jesus and Mary Chain</a>) with the Pixies, and <a href="The_Beach_Boys" title="wikilink">The Beach Boys</a>' &quot;<a href="Hang_On_To_Your_Ego" title="wikilink">Hang On To Your Ego</a>&quot; in his solo career.</p>
<p>Other media has influenced Black. References to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies, appear in his work; most notably in the <a href="incest" title="wikilink">incestuous</a> tale of &quot;<a href="Nimrod_(king)" title="wikilink">Nimrod</a>'s Son&quot;, the stories of <a href="Uriah_the_Hittite" title="wikilink">Uriah</a>, <a href="Bathsheba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bathsheba</a> in &quot;Dead&quot;, <a href="Samson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samson</a> in &quot;Gouge Away&quot; and references to the <a href="The_Tower_of_Babel" title="wikilink">The Tower of Babel</a> in songs such as &quot;Build High&quot; and &quot;Old Black Dawning&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> He cited surrealist films <a href="Eraserhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eraserhead</a> and <a href="Un_Chien_Andalou" title="wikilink">Un Chien Andalou</a> (as mentioned in &quot;Debaser&quot;) as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, Surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' <em>Doolittle</em>), saying he &quot;didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels&quot;, but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="songwriting-and-lyrics">Songwriting and lyrics</h3>
<p>During his stay in Puerto Rico, Black acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of <a href="Spanish_(language)" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including &quot;Isla de Encanta&quot; and &quot;Vamos&quot;, reference his experiences in <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan</a>, and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's <a href="slang" class="uri" title="wikilink">slang</a>. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song &quot;Isla De Encanta&quot;, named after the island's <a href="motto" class="uri" title="wikilink">motto</a>, &quot;Isla Del Encanto&quot;. Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include &quot;Vamos&quot; (<em><a href="Come_on_Pilgrim" title="wikilink">Come on Pilgrim</a></em>), &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot;, &quot;<a href="Where_Is_My_Mind?" title="wikilink">Where Is My Mind?</a>&quot; (<em><a href="Surfer_Rosa" title="wikilink">Surfer Rosa</a></em>) and the B-side &quot;Bailey's Walk&quot;. Several of his songs contain Spanish lyrics, most notably in the Pixies' first album, <em>Come On Pilgrim</em>, and a Spanish translation of &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot; by <a href="The_Yardbirds" title="wikilink">The Yardbirds</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> and its culture.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Black's lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as <a href="outer_space" title="wikilink">outer space</a>, <a href="Unidentified_flying_object" title="wikilink">UFOs</a>, and <a href="The_Three_Stooges" title="wikilink">The Three Stooges</a> — the last of these being the subject of &quot;Two Reelers&quot;, a song from <em>Teenager of the Year</em>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song &quot;St. Francis Dam Disaster&quot; (from <em>Dog in the Sand</em>) is about the catastrophic collapse of the <a href="St._Francis_Dam" title="wikilink">St. Francis Dam</a> near Los Angeles in March <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>,<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and the <em>All My Ghosts</em> <a href="EP" class="uri" title="wikilink">EP</a> featured an account of the &quot;Humboldt County Massacre&quot; of <a href="Wiyot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiyot</a> Indians in <a href="1860" class="uri" title="wikilink">1860</a> near <a href="Eureka,_California" title="wikilink">Eureka, California</a>.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>As part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles. <a href="Elektra_Records" title="wikilink">Elektra Records</a>' Peter Lubin commented that &quot;to get videos out of them was a major [...] undertaking and it only got worse over time&quot;, citing the fact that Black refused to <a href="lip-sync" class="uri" title="wikilink">lip-sync</a> to <a href="music_videos" title="wikilink">music videos</a>;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> the video for the Pixies' &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_Your_Man" title="wikilink">Here Comes Your Man</a>&quot; features Black and Deal opening their mouths as the vocals are being heard, mocking the practice.</p>
<p>In his early solo career as Frank Black, his videos were more professional; he became more willing to take part in them. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; is an example; the video features Black riding across a desert on a <a href="hovercraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">hovercraft</a>. <a href="They_Might_Be_Giants" title="wikilink">They Might Be Giants</a>' <a href="John_Flansburgh" title="wikilink">John Flansburgh</a>, who helped produce the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; video, later commented on the change in Black's attitude to music videos:<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>Black has only released one music video since leaving 4AD, a low-budget video in Germany for <em>Dog in the Sand</em>'s &quot;Robert Onion&quot;. The last widely-released video produced for Black's solo material was for &quot;Headache&quot;, from <em>Teenager of the Year</em>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
