<p>The <strong>Mauritius Blue Pigeon</strong> (<em>Alectroenas nitidissima</em>) is an <a href="extinct" class="uri" title="wikilink">extinct</a> <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of <a href="blue_pigeon" title="wikilink">blue pigeon</a> formerly <a href="endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a> in the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> east of <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>. It has two extinct relatives from the Mascarenes and three <a href="wikt:extant" title="wikilink">extant</a> ones from other islands.</p>
<p>It had white <a href="hackles" class="uri" title="wikilink">hackles</a> around the head, neck and breast and blue plumage on the body, and it was red on the tail and the bare parts of the head. These colours were thought similar to those of the <a href="Dutch_flag" title="wikilink">Dutch flag</a>, a resemblance reflected in some of the bird's names. It was 30Â cm (12 in) long and larger and more robust than any other blue pigeon species. It could raise its hackles into a <a href="ruff" class="uri" title="wikilink">ruff</a>, which it used for display. Its call sounded like &quot;barf barf&quot; and it also made a cooing noise. It fed on fruits, nuts, and <a href="molluscs" class="uri" title="wikilink">molluscs</a>, and was once widespread in the forests of Mauritius.</p>
<p>The bird was first mentioned in the 17th century and was described several times thereafter, but very few accounts describe the behaviour of living specimens. Several stuffed and at least one live specimen reached Europe in the 1700s and 1800s. Only three stuffed specimens exist today, and only one bird was ever depicted when alive. The species is thought to have become extinct in the 1830s as a result of <a href="deforestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">deforestation</a> and predation.</p>

<p><img src="Columba_nitidissima.jpg" title="fig:Illustration of a stuffed specimen published with Sonnerat&#39;s 1782 description" alt="Illustration of a stuffed specimen published with Sonnerat&#39;s 1782 description" /> The first record of the Mauritius Blue Pigeon is two sketches in the 1601&lt;U+2013&gt;1603 journal of the Dutch ship <em>Gelderland</em>. The birds appear to have been freshly killed or stunned. The drawings were made by the Dutch artist Joris Joostensz Laerle on Mauritius, but were not published until 1969. Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Cauche in 1651 briefly mentions &quot;white, black and red turtle doves&quot;, encountered in 1638, which is thought to be the first unequivocal mention of the bird. The next account is that of <a href="Joseph_Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Charpentier_de_Cossigny" title="wikilink">Joseph Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Charpentier de Cossigny</a> in the mid-1700s.</p>
<p><a href="Pierre_Sonnerat" title="wikilink">Pierre Sonnerat</a> brought the bird to the attention of <a href="ornithologists" class="uri" title="wikilink">ornithologists</a> in 1782, calling it <em>Pigeon Hollandais</em> (Dutch Pigeon), a French <a href="vernacular_name" title="wikilink">vernacular name</a> that derives from its white, dark blue and red colouration, which reminded Sonnerat of the <a href="Dutch_flag" title="wikilink">Dutch flag</a>. He had collected two specimens during a voyage in 1774. These <a href="syntype" class="uri" title="wikilink">syntype</a> specimens were deposited in the <a href="Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;um_national_d&#39;Histoire_naturelle" title="wikilink">Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;um national d'Histoire naturelle</a> in Paris, where they were later damaged by <a href="sulphuric_acid" title="wikilink">sulphuric acid</a> fumes; by 1893, only one of them still existed. Since Sonnerat named and described them in French, the <a href="scientific_naming" title="wikilink">scientific naming</a> of the bird was left to <a href="Giovanni_Antonio_Scopoli" title="wikilink">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a>, who did not observe a specimen himself, but <a href="latinised" class="uri" title="wikilink">latinised</a> Sonnerat's description. He named the bird <em>Columba nitidissima</em>, which means &quot;most brilliant pigeon&quot;. When <a href="Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin" title="wikilink">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> redescribed the bird with the species name <em>franciae</em> (&quot;of France&quot;) in 1789, he referred to the now-familiar <a href="Flag_of_France" title="wikilink">tricolour</a> which had just been flown for the first time. <a href="Pierre_Joseph_Bonnaterre" title="wikilink">Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre</a> used the name <em>batavica</em> (&quot;the Dutch one&quot;) in his redescription in 1790. Another skin arrived at the Paris museum in 1800, collected by Colonel M. Mathieu for <a href="Louis_Dufresne" title="wikilink">Louis Dufresne</a>. It was sold in 1819 among other items, was sent to <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, and is now in the <a href="National_Museum_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">National Museum of Scotland</a>. It was not identified as a Mauritius Blue Pigeon until <a href="Alfred_Newton" title="wikilink">Alfred Newton</a> saw it in 1879. The last specimen recorded was shot in <a href="Savanne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Savanne</a> in 1826 and given to <a href="Julien_Desjardins" title="wikilink">Julien Desjardins</a>, founder of the <a href="Mauritius_Natural_History_Museum" title="wikilink">Mauritius Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="Port_Louis" title="wikilink">Port Louis</a>, where it is still located, though in poor condition. Only these three <a href="taxidermic" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxidermic</a> specimens still survive.</p>
<p>In 1840 <a href="George_Robert_Gray" title="wikilink">George Robert Gray</a> named a new <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a>, <em><a href="Alectroenas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alectroenas</a></em>, for the Mauritius Blue Pigeon; <em>alektruon</em> in Greek means <a href="domestic_cock" title="wikilink">domestic cock</a>, and <em>oinas</em> means <a href="dove" class="uri" title="wikilink">dove</a>. <em>Alectroenas nitidissima</em> is the <a href="type_species" title="wikilink">type species</a> of the genus, which includes all <a href="blue_pigeons" title="wikilink">blue pigeons</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Subfossil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subfossil</a> remains of the Mauritius Blue Pigeon were collected in the <a href="Mare_aux_Songes" title="wikilink">Mare aux Songes</a> <a href="swamp" class="uri" title="wikilink">swamp</a> by Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;odore Sauzier in 1889. More were collected by Etienne Thirioux around 1900. They are thought to have been found near <a href="Le_Pouce" title="wikilink">Le Pouce</a> and <a href="Plaine_des_Roches" title="wikilink">Plaine des Roches</a>.</p>
<h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3>
<p><em>Alectroenas</em> blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in the western <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>. They are <a href="allopatric" class="uri" title="wikilink">allopatric</a> and can therefore be regarded as a <a href="superspecies" class="uri" title="wikilink">superspecies</a>. There are three extant species: the <a href="Madagascar_Blue_Pigeon" title="wikilink">Madagascar Blue Pigeon</a>, the <a href="Comoro_Blue_Pigeon" title="wikilink">Comoro Blue Pigeon</a>, and the <a href="Seychelles_Blue_Pigeon" title="wikilink">Seychelles Blue Pigeon</a>. The three <a href="Mascarene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mascarene</a> islands were each home to a species: the Mauritius Blue Pigeon, the <a href="Rodrigues_Blue_Pigeon" title="wikilink">Rodrigues Blue Pigeon</a>, and the <a href="R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union_Blue_Pigeon" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union Blue Pigeon</a>, all of which are extinct. Compared with other pigeons, the blue pigeons are medium to large, stocky, and have longer wings and tails. All the species have distinct mobile <a href="hackles" class="uri" title="wikilink">hackles</a> on the head and neck. The <a href="tibiotarsus" class="uri" title="wikilink">tibiotarsus</a> is comparatively long and the <a href="tarsometatarsus" class="uri" title="wikilink">tarsometatarsus</a> short.</p>
<p>The blue pigeons may have colonised the Mascarenes, the <a href="Seychelles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seychelles</a> or a now submerged <a href="hotspot_island" title="wikilink">hotspot island</a> by &quot;island hopping&quot;. They may have evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>. Their closest <a href="genetics" title="wikilink">genetic</a> relative is the <a href="Cloven-feathered_Dove" title="wikilink">Cloven-feathered Dove</a> of <a href="New_Caledonia" title="wikilink">New Caledonia</a>, <em>Drepanoptila holosericea</em>, from which they separated 8&lt;U+2013&gt;9 million years ago. Their ancestral group appears to be the <a href="fruit_doves" title="wikilink">fruit doves</a>, <em>Ptilinopus</em>, of <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a> and <a href="Oceania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oceania</a>.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><img src="Mauritius_Blue_Pigeon.jpg" title="fig:1811 illustration of a stuffed specimen by Madame Knip and C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Macret" alt="1811 illustration of a stuffed specimen by Madame Knip and C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Macret" /> The feathers on the head, neck and breast of the Mauritius Blue Pigeon were silvery white, long, stiffened and pointed, especially around the neck. A patch of bright red, naked skin surrounded the eyes, and extended across the cheeks to the beak, which was greenish with a dark tip. The plumage of the body was <a href="indigo" class="uri" title="wikilink">indigo</a>, and the back, <a href="scapular_feathers" title="wikilink">scapular feathers</a> and wings were metallic blue. The base of the outer <a href="rectrices" class="uri" title="wikilink">rectrices</a> was partially blackish blue. The tail feathers and tail <a href="coverts" class="uri" title="wikilink">coverts</a> were <a href="maroon" class="uri" title="wikilink">maroon</a>. The legs were dark <a href="slate-grey" class="uri" title="wikilink">slate-grey</a>. The <a href="iris_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">iris</a> was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring. The bird was 30 cms (12Â in) in length, the wings were 208Â mm (8.2 in), the tail was 132Â mm (5.2 in), the <a href="Culmen_(bird)" title="wikilink">culmen</a> was 25Â mm (1 in), and the <a href="tarsus_(skeleton)" title="wikilink">tarsals</a> were 28Â mm (1.10 in). It was the largest and most robust member of its genus, and the hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons.</p>
<p>Unlike the three surviving skins of Mauritius Blue Pigeons, one of two illustrations (the other is in <a href="black-and-white" class="uri" title="wikilink">black-and-white</a>) of a live individual kept in the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> around 1790 shows a red forehead. Both sexes of the Seychelles Blue Pigeon also have red foreheads, and <a href="Julian_Hume" title="wikilink">Julian Hume</a> has suggested that the image depicts a male, which was described as &quot;infinitely more handsome&quot; than the female by Cossigny in the mid-1700s. Hume therefore interprets the three surviving skins as belonging to female specimens. A Mauritian woman recalling observations of Mauritius Blue Pigeons around 1815 mentioned green as one of its colours. Juvenile Seychelles and Comoro Blue Pigeons have green feathers, so this may also have been the case for juvenile Mauritian Pigeons.</p>
<p>Some depictions and descriptions have shown the legs of Mauritius Blue Pigeons as red, like those of the Madagascar Blue Pigeon. The legs of the Paris specimen were painted red when the original colour faded, presumably on the basis of such accounts. The legs of the two other surviving specimens have not been painted and have faded to a yellowish brown. The bird has also recently been depicted with facial <a href="crenulation" title="wikilink">crenulations</a>, like those of the Seychelles Blue Pigeon. Neither feature is mentioned in contemporary accounts, and such depictions are thought to be erroneous.</p>
<h2 id="behaviour-and-ecology">Behaviour and ecology</h2>
<p><img src="Pavillon_Hollandais.jpg" title="fig:Life drawings of a male with raised and lowered hackles, by G. Haasbroek, c. 1790" alt="Life drawings of a male with raised and lowered hackles, by G. Haasbroek, c. 1790" /> Few descriptions of the behaviour of Mauritius Blue Pigeons are known; unpublished notes by Desjardins are now lost. An individual was brought to the Netherlands around 1790, where it survived in the <a href="menagerie" class="uri" title="wikilink">menagerie</a> of <a href="William_V,_Prince_of_Orange" title="wikilink">William V, Prince of Orange</a> for three months before dying of <a href="oedema" class="uri" title="wikilink">oedema</a>. The only two known life drawings of the species (by G. Haasbroek) depict this individual. The illustrations show a <a href="displaying" class="uri" title="wikilink">displaying</a> male raising its hackles into a <a href="ruff" class="uri" title="wikilink">ruff</a>. This is a characteristic behaviour of other blue pigeons, too, and they can also vibrate their hackles. The following description of the display behaviour and <a href="Bird_call" title="wikilink">calls</a> of this individual was written on the back on the coloured drawing by Arnout Vosmaer, director of the menagerie:</p>

<p><img src="Alectroenas_nitidissima-John_Gerrard_Keulemans_improved.jpg" title="fig:1907 John Gerrard Keulemans illustration of a stuffed specimen with discoloured legs" alt="1907 John Gerrard Keulemans illustration of a stuffed specimen with discoloured legs" /> The Mauritius Blue Pigeon probably lived in pairs or small groups in humid, mountainous <a href="evergreen_forest" title="wikilink">evergreen forests</a>, like their extant relatives. Subfossil remains have been found in mid-west, mid-east and south-east Mauritius, indicating that the bird was once widespread. By 1812, <a href="Jacques_G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard_Milbert" title="wikilink">Jacques G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Milbert</a> stated that solitary individuals were found in river valleys. They probably became rarer during French rule in Mauritius (1715&lt;U+2013&gt;1810), as lowland areas of the island were almost completely <a href="deforested" class="uri" title="wikilink">deforested</a> during this time.</p>
<p>Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man, so the <a href="ecosystem" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecosystem</a> of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, forests covered Mauritius entirely, but very little remains today because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The Mauritius Blue Pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the <a href="Dodo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dodo</a>, the <a href="Red_Rail" title="wikilink">Red Rail</a>, <a href="Thirioux&#39;s_Grey_Parrot" title="wikilink">Thirioux's Grey Parrot</a>, the <a href="Broad-billed_Parrot" title="wikilink">Broad-billed Parrot</a>, the <a href="Mauritius_Owl" title="wikilink">Mauritius Owl</a>, the <a href="Mascarene_Coot" title="wikilink">Mascarene Coot</a>, the <a href="Mauritian_Shelduck" title="wikilink">Mauritian Shelduck</a>, the <a href="Mauritian_Duck" title="wikilink">Mauritian Duck</a> and the <a href="Mauritius_Night_Heron" title="wikilink">Mauritius Night Heron</a>. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the <a href="saddle-backed_Mauritius_giant_tortoise" title="wikilink">saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="domed_Mauritius_giant_tortoise" title="wikilink">domed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="Mauritian_giant_skink" title="wikilink">Mauritian giant skink</a> and the <a href="Round_Island_burrowing_boa" title="wikilink">Round Island burrowing boa</a>. The <a href="small_Mauritian_flying_fox" title="wikilink">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail <em><a href="Tropidophora_carinata" title="wikilink">Tropidophora carinata</a></em> lived on Mauritius and R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as <em><a href="Casearia_tinifolia" title="wikilink">Casearia tinifolia</a></em> and the <a href="palm_orchid" title="wikilink">palm orchid</a>, have also become extinct.</p>
<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
<p><img src="Columba_franciae.jpg" title="fig:1808 illustration of a stuffed specimen by J. Reinold" alt="1808 illustration of a stuffed specimen by J. Reinold" /> Fruits and nuts were probably the mainstay of the Mauritius Blue Pigeon's diet, and like other blue pigeons, it may have occupied the upper <a href="canopy_(biology)" title="wikilink">canopy</a>, and migrated seasonally to where food was available. Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid-1700s and later sent it and its stomach contents to <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Antoine_Ferchault_de_R&lt;U+00E9&gt;aumur" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Antoine Ferchault de R&lt;U+00E9&gt;aumur</a> with a letter describing his findings. The <a href="gizzard" class="uri" title="wikilink">gizzard</a> and <a href="crop" class="uri" title="wikilink">crop</a> contained four &quot;nuts&quot;, which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either <em><a href="Calophyllum_tacamahaca" title="wikilink">Calophyllum tacamahaca</a></em> or <em><a href="Labourdonnaisia_calophylloides" title="wikilink">Labourdonnaisia calophylloides</a></em>. The Comoro and Seychelles Blue Pigeons also feed on <em>C. tacamahaca</em>, and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds.</p>
<p>In 1812 Jacques G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild:</p>

<p>The claim that the bird fed on river <a href="molluscs" class="uri" title="wikilink">molluscs</a> has been criticised by <a href="James_Greenway" title="wikilink">James Greenway</a>, as blue pigeons are principally <a href="arboreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">arboreal</a>, but other mainly <a href="frugivorous" class="uri" title="wikilink">frugivorous</a> pigeons, such as species of <em>Ptilinopus</em> and <em><a href="Gallicolumba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallicolumba</a></em>, do occasionally eat molluscs and other <a href="invertebrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">invertebrates</a>. The two species of <em><a href="Nesoenas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nesoenas</a></em> have also been reported as eating <a href="freshwater_snails" title="wikilink">freshwater snails</a>, and one was seen hunting tadpoles. Milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails, as extant blue pigeons rarely land on the ground. A diet of snails would have provided the birds with calcium for egg production.</p>
<h2 id="extinction">Extinction</h2>
<p>The Mauritius Blue Pigeon coexisted with humans for 200 years. Its decline can be correlated with deforestation, which is also the main threat to extant blue pigeons. Little lowland forest was left on the island by 1859. Frugivorous birds often need a large area for foraging and move between forest types to feed on different types of food, which grow irregularly. Other blue pigeons perch on bare branches, making them vulnerable to hunters. Cossigny noted that the bird had already become rare by the 1730s and attributed the decline to deforestation and hunting by escaped slaves. Unlike the <a href="Pink_Pigeon" title="wikilink">Pink Pigeon</a>, which still survives on Mauritius today, the Mauritius Blue Pigeon was not seasonally poisonous (though it was reputed to be) or unpalatable, and it was hunted for food. <img src="Alectroenas_nitidissima.jpg" title="fig:Sketches of hunted specimens on Mauritius, from the journal of the Dutch ship Gelderland, by Joris Joostensz Laerle, 1601" alt="Sketches of hunted specimens on Mauritius, from the journal of the Dutch ship Gelderland, by Joris Joostensz Laerle, 1601" /> The last confirmed specimen was shot in the Savanne district in 1826, and the 1832 report by Desjardins suggests that some could still be found in remote forests in the centre of the island. <a href="Edward_Newton" title="wikilink">Edward Newton</a> (convinced that the Pigeon still survived) interviewed two inhabitants of Mauritius about the Mauritius Blue Pigeon in 1863, and these accounts suggest that the bird survived until at least 1837. The first interviewee claimed he had killed two specimens when <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> <a href="James_Simpson_(British_Army_officer)" title="wikilink">James Simpson</a> stayed on the island, which was 1826&lt;U+2013&gt;37. The second was a woman who had last seen a bird around this time, and recalled hunts of it in approximately 1815, in a swampy area near <a href="Black_River_Gorges" title="wikilink">Black River Gorges</a>, south western Mauritius: <img src="Edinburgh_Blue_Pigeon.jpg" title="fig:The Edinburgh specimen" alt="The Edinburgh specimen" /> </p>
<p>It can be concluded that the Mauritius Blue Pigeon became extinct in the 1830s. Apart from habitat destruction and hunting, introduced predators, mainly <a href="crab-eating_macaque" title="wikilink">crab-eating macaques</a>, were probably also responsible.</p>
