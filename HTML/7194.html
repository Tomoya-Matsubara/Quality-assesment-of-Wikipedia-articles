<p>The <strong>Thirteenth Amendment</strong> to the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a> abolished <a href="Slavery_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">slavery</a> and <a href="involuntary_servitude" title="wikilink">involuntary servitude</a>, except as punishment for a crime. It was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, by the House on January 31, 1865, and adopted on December 6, 1865. On December 18, 1865, <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William_H._Seward" title="wikilink">William H. Seward</a> proclaimed it to have been adopted. It was the first of the three <a href="Reconstruction_Amendments" title="wikilink">Reconstruction Amendments</a> adopted following the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Slavery had been tacitly protected in the original Constitution through clauses such as the <a href="Three-Fifths_Compromise" title="wikilink">Three-Fifths Compromise</a>, in which three-fifths of the slave population was counted for representation in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a>. Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, more than sixty years had passed since the <a href="Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">last amendment to the Constitution</a> had been successfully ratified. Though many slaves had been declared free by Lincoln's 1863 <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, their post-war status was uncertain. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all <a href="Union_(Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union states</a>, and by a sufficient number of border and &quot;reconstructed&quot; Southern states to cause it to be adopted before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Though the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States, factors such as <a href="Black_Codes_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Black Codes</a>, white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black Americans to involuntary labor, particularly in the South. In contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law, but has been used to strike down <a href="debt_peonage" title="wikilink">debt peonage</a> and some race-based discrimination as &quot;badges and incidents of slavery&quot;. Unlike the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fifteenth</a> Amendments, the Thirteenth applies to private citizens as well as <a href="state_actor" title="wikilink">state actors</a>. The amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against <a href="sex_trafficking" title="wikilink">sex trafficking</a> and other modern forms of slavery.</p>

<p>Between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery. No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost 4 million people in 1861.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> An <a href="Abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolitionist movement</a> headed by such figures as <a href="William_Lloyd_Garrison" title="wikilink">William Lloyd Garrison</a> grew in strength in the North, calling for the end of slavery nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South. In 1836, the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a> instituted a <a href="gag_rule" title="wikilink">gag rule</a> against abolitionist petitions and speeches, attempting to stifle <a href="John_Quincy_Adams" title="wikilink">John Quincy Adams</a> and other abolitionist congressmen. The <a href="American_Colonization_Society" title="wikilink">American Colonization Society</a>, an alliance between abolitionists who felt the races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions, called for the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and slaves to Africa. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a>, who feared that the main abolitionist movement would provoke a civil war.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment were introduced by Representative <a href="Arthur_Livermore" title="wikilink">Arthur Livermore</a> in 1818 and by John Quincy Adams in 1839, but failed to gain significant traction.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>As the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The 1820 <a href="Missouri_Compromise" title="wikilink">Missouri Compromise</a> provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the <a href="Wilmot_Proviso" title="wikilink">Wilmot Proviso</a> was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the <a href="Mexican&lt;U+2013&gt;American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican&lt;U+2013&gt;American War</a>; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005&lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;123&quot;/&gt; The <a href="Compromise_of_1850" title="wikilink">Compromise of 1850</a> temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger <a href="Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850" title="wikilink">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to rise over the subsequent decade, inflamed by, amongst other things, the publication of the 1852 anti-slavery novel <em><a href="Uncle_Tom&#39;s_Cabin" title="wikilink">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Bleeding_Kansas" title="wikilink">fighting between pro-slave and abolitionist forces</a> in Kansas, beginning in 1854;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> the 1857 <em>Dred Scott</em> decision, which struck down provisions of the Compromise of 1850;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> abolitionist <a href="John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="wikilink">John Brown's</a> 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at <a href="John_Brown&#39;s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry" title="wikilink">Harpers Ferry</a>;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the 1860 election of slavery critic <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a> to the presidency.

<p><img src="James_Mitchell_Ashley_-_Brady-Handy.jpg" title="fig:Representative James Mitchell Ashley proposed an amendment abolishing slavery in 1863." alt="Representative James Mitchell Ashley proposed an amendment abolishing slavery in 1863." /> Acting under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued an <a href="Emancipation_Proclamation" title="wikilink">Emancipation Proclamation</a> on January 1, 1863, declaring all slaves in rebel-controlled territory to be free; however, the proclamation did not affect the status of slaves in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Lincoln followed with the December 1863 &quot;<a href="Ten_percent_plan" title="wikilink">Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction</a>&quot;, which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Southern states did not readily accept the deal, and the status of slavery remained uncertain.</p>
<p>In the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various proposals for Reconstruction.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative <a href="James_Mitchell_Ashley" title="wikilink">James Mitchell Ashley</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Representative <a href="James_F._Wilson" title="wikilink">James F. Wilson</a> soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator <a href="John_B._Henderson" title="wikilink">John B. Henderson</a> of Missouri submitted a <a href="joint_resolution" title="wikilink">joint resolution</a> for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The <a href="United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary" title="wikilink">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, chaired by <a href="Lyman_Trumbull" title="wikilink">Lyman Trumbull</a>, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.</p>
<p><a href="Radical_Republicans" title="wikilink">Radical Republicans</a> led by Senator <a href="Charles_Sumner" title="wikilink">Charles Sumner</a> and Representative <a href="Thaddeus_Stevens" title="wikilink">Thaddeus Stevens</a> sought a more expansive version of the amendment.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On February 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sumner tried to circumvent the Judiciary Committee, controlled by Trumbull, in order to promote his more expansive wording, but failed.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> On February 10 the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and Henderson.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The Committee's version used text from the <a href="Northwest_Ordinance" title="wikilink">Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787, which stipulates (for territories in the region now called the <a href="Midwest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midwest</a>): &quot;There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the basis for its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have reduced the Article V standards for amendment (requiring only a majority vote in Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6. However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the 1864 presidential race, former <a href="Free_Soil_Party" title="wikilink">Free Soil Party</a> candidate <a href="John_C._Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;mont" title="wikilink">John C.

<h3 id="congressional-debate">Congressional debate</h3>
<p>With no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on <a href="federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalism</a> and <a href="state&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">state's rights</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Some argued that the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution that it would not be a valid &quot;amendment&quot; but would instead constitute &quot;revolution&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Some opponents warned that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Republicans argued that slavery was uncivilized and that abolition was a necessary step in national progress.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Ending slavery, said advocates, would restore the <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a> and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>White Northern Republicans, and some Democrats, became excited about an abolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Many blacks, particularly in the South, focused more on landownership and education as the key to liberation.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats gradually announced their support for the amendment, including Representative <a href="James_Brooks_(politician)" title="wikilink">James Brooks</a>,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Senator <a href="Reverdy_Johnson" title="wikilink">Reverdy Johnson</a>,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and <a href="Tammany_Hall" title="wikilink">Tammany Hall</a>, a powerful New York <a href="political_machine" title="wikilink">political machine</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="passage-by-congress">Passage by Congress</h3>
<p>Lincoln had been concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation might be reversed or found invalid after the war and saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> After winning the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1864" title="wikilink">election of 1864</a>, Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning his efforts while the &quot;lame duck&quot; session was still in office.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Popular support for the amendment was mounting and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6 State of the Union speech: &lt;U+201C&gt;there is only a question of <em>time</em> as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action.

<p>Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative <a href="John_B._Alley" title="wikilink">John B.

<p>Republicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained in the elections for <a href="United_States_Senate_elections,_1864" title="wikilink">Senate</a> and <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1864" title="wikilink">House</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Opposition to the measure was led by the 1864 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Representative <a href="George_H._Pendleton" title="wikilink">George H.

<p>In mid-January, Speaker of the House <a href="Schuyler_Colfax" title="wikilink">Schuyler Colfax</a> estimated the amendment to be five votes short of passage. Ashley postponed the vote.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> At this point, Lincoln intensified his push for the amendment, making direct emotional appeals to particular members of Congress.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> On January 31, 1865, the House called another vote on the amendment, with neither side being certain of the outcome. Every Republican supported the measure, as well as 16 Democrats, almost all of them lame ducks. The amendment finally passed by a vote of 119 to 56, narrowly reaching the required two-thirds majority.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The House exploded into celebration, with some members openly weeping.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Black onlookers, who had only been allowed to attend Congressional sessions since the previous year, cheered from the galleries.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>The war had not officially ended, and the legal status of the defeated Southern states (and by extension, the legal requirements for Constitutional amendment) remained ambiguous.

<p>On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln <a href="Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">was assassinated</a>. With Congress out of session, Lincoln's successor <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a> began a period known as &quot;Presidential Reconstruction&quot;, in which he personally oversaw the creation of new governments in seven Southern states.

The Amendment was also used as authorization for several <a href="Freedmen&#39;s_Bureau_bills" title="wikilink">Freedmen's Bureau bills</a>.

<p><em>U. S. v.

John Bylew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family, the Fosters. Bylew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice in the head with an ax. Bylew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5&lt;U+2013&gt;2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act.

In the (7&lt;U+2013&gt;1) majority decision, the Court found that &quot;a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races—a distinction which is founded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color—has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude.&quot; Harlan dissented, writing: &quot;The thin disguise of 'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one, nor, atone for the wrong this day done.&quot;<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em><a href="Hodges_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Hodges v. United States</a></em> (1906),<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> the Court struck down a federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who &quot;conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States&quot;. A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was convicted by a federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute, which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that &quot;no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery&quot;. Harlan dissented, maintaining his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond &quot;physical restraint&quot;.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> <em>Corrigan v. Buckley</em> (1922) reaffirmed the interpretation from <em>Hodges</em>, finding that the amendment does not apply to <a href="restrictive_covenant" title="wikilink">restrictive covenants</a>.</p>
<p>Enforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in <em>Clyatt v. United States</em> (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>

The Court held (in a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;2 decision):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom&lt;U+2014&gt;freedom to &lt;U+201C&gt;go and come at pleasure&lt;U+201D&gt; and to &lt;U+201C&gt;buy and sell when they please&lt;U+201D&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;would be left with &lt;U+201C&gt;a mere paper guarantee&lt;U+201D&gt; if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>

<p>The Court in <em>Jones</em> reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary society to the history of slavery in the United States.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="other-cases-of-involuntary-servitude">Other cases of involuntary servitude</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In <em>Robertson v. Baldwin</em> (1897), a sailor challenged federal rules mandating the capture and return of deserters. The Court ruled that the &quot;the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional.&quot; In this case, as in numerous &lt;U+201C&gt;badges and incidents&lt;U+201D&gt; cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="earlier-proposed-amendments">Earlier proposed amendments</h2>
<p>Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, no <a href="List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">constitutional amendments</a> had been adopted in more than 60 years. Two earlier amendments proposed by the Congress would have become the Thirteenth Amendment, but failed to be ratified by a sufficient number of states: the <a href="Titles_of_Nobility_Amendment" title="wikilink">Titles of Nobility Amendment</a> and the <a href="Corwin_Amendment" title="wikilink">Corwin Amendment</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Titles of Nobility Amendment was passed by the Senate on April 26, 1810, and by the House on May 1, 1810, but was ratified only by twelve states. It would have revoked the citizenship of anyone accepting any foreign payment without Congressional authorization or accepting a foreign title of nobility.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Corwin Amendment was passed by the House on February 28, 1861 and by the Senate on March 2, 1861, but was ratified only by Ohio, Illinois, and Maryland.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> It would have forbidden the adopting of any constitutional amendment abolishing or restricting slavery within a state, or permitting the Congress to do so.

<li id="fn6">Tsesis, <em>The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom</em> (2004), p. 14. &quot;Nineteenth century apologists for the expansion of slavery developed a political philosophy that placed property at the pinnacle of personal interests and regarded its protection to be the government's chief purpose. The Fifth Amendment's Just Compensation clause provided the proslavery camp with a bastion for fortifying the peculiar institution against congressional restrictions to its spread westward. Based on this property-rights centered argument, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in <em>Dred Scott v. Sanford</em> (1857), found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutionally violated due process.&quot;<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

It was almost universally desired by Southern blacks, as it was by landless peasants the world over.

The amendments he had recommended in December 1862 had gone nowhere, mainly because they reflected an outdated program of gradual emancipation, which included compensation and colonization. Moreover, Lincoln knew that he did not have to propose amendments because others more devoted to abolition would, especially if he pointed out the vulnerability of existing emancipation legislation. He was also concerned about negative reactions from conservatives, particularly potential new recruits from the Democrats.<a href="#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

At the moment that Republicans were promoting new, far-reaching legislation for African Americans, they had to keep this legislation detached from the first constitutional amendment dealing exclusively with African American freedom.

Further, with time, even leading antislavery Republicans would become less adamant and more willing to reconcile with the South than protect the rights of the newly freed. This was clear by the time Horace Greely accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1872 and even more when President Rutherford B. Hayes entered the Compromise of 1877, agreeing to withdraw federal troops from the South.&quot;<a href="#fnref126" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

The Court did not revisit the amendment's meaning until 1968, during the heyday of the Civil Rights movement. In <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer</em>, the Court found that the Thirteenth Amendment not only ended unrecompensed, forced labor but that its second section also empowered Congress to develop legislation that is 'rationally' related to ending any remaining 'badges and incidents of servitude'.&quot;<a href="#fnref158" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
