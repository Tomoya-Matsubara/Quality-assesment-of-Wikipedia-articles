<p><strong>Thelma Catherine</strong> &quot;<strong>Pat</strong>&quot; <strong>Ryan Nixon</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (March 16, 1912 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 22, 1993) was the wife of <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>, 37th <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a>, and was <a href="First_Lady_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">First Lady of the United States</a> from 1969 to 1974. She was commonly known as <strong>Patricia</strong> or <strong>Pat Nixon</strong>.</p>
<p>Born in Nevada, Pat Ryan grew up in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. She graduated from high school in 1929, then attended <a href="Fullerton_Junior_College" title="wikilink">Fullerton Junior College</a> and later the <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">University of Southern California</a>. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, <a href="X-ray_technician" title="wikilink">X-ray technician</a>, and retail store clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters. Pat campaigned for her husband in his successful <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">congressional</a> campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> in the <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Eisenhower</a> administration, whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1960" title="wikilink">1960 presidential campaign</a>, and later in his successful <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1968" title="wikilink">presidential campaign of 1968</a>.</p>
<p>As First Lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including <a href="volunteerism" class="uri" title="wikilink">volunteerism</a>. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a>, an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. Pat became the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history up to that time, visiting about 80 nations; she was the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. These trips gained her favorable reception in the media and the host countries. Her tenure ended when, after being re-elected in a <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1972" title="wikilink">landslide victory in 1972</a>, President Nixon resigned two years later amid the <a href="Watergate_scandal" title="wikilink">Watergate scandal</a>.</p>
<p>Her public appearances became less frequent in her later life. She and her husband returned to <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, and later moved to <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>. Pat suffered two <a href="stroke" title="wikilink">strokes</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;one in 1976 and another in 1983&lt;U+2014&gt;and was later diagnosed with <a href="lung_cancer" title="wikilink">lung cancer</a> in 1992. She died in 1993 aged 81.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in the small mining town of <a href="Ely,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Ely, Nevada</a>, the day before <a href="St._Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">St. Patrick's Day</a>. Her father, William M. Ryan, Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and <a href="market_gardening" title="wikilink">truck farmer</a> of Irish descent. Her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Pat was a nickname given to her by her father, referring to her birthdate and Irish ancestry.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Upon enrolling in college in 1931 she dropped her first name of Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally rendering it as Patricia; the name change, however, was not a legal action, merely one of preference.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>After her birth, the Ryan family moved near <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a>, and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in <a href="Artesia,_California" title="wikilink">Artesia</a> (present-day <a href="Cerritos,_California" title="wikilink">Cerritos</a>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During this time she worked on the family farm, and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother died of cancer in 1924.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Pat, who was 12 at the time, assumed all the household duties for her father, who died in 1929 of <a href="silicosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">silicosis</a>, and two older brothers, William Jr. (1910&lt;U+2013&gt;1997) and Thomas (1911&lt;U+2013&gt;1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (born 1909), and a half-brother, Matthew Bender (born 1907), from her mother's first marriage;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> her mother's first husband had died during a <a href="flash_flood" title="wikilink">flash flood</a> in South Dakota.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="education-and-career">Education and career</h2>
<p>It has been said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as consistently before their marriage as did Pat Nixon.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> As she told the writer <a href="Gloria_Steinem" title="wikilink">Gloria Steinem</a> during the 1968 presidential campaign, &quot;I never had time to think about things like that&lt;U+2014&gt;who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>After graduating from <a href="Excelsior_High_School_(Norwalk,_California)" title="wikilink">Excelsior High School</a> in 1929, Pat Ryan attended <a href="Fullerton_College" title="wikilink">Fullerton Junior College</a>. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and from 1930 until 1932, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and an <a href="X-ray_technician" title="wikilink">X-ray technician</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Determined &quot;to make something out of myself&quot;,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> she enrolled in 1931 at the <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">University of Southern California</a> (USC), where she majored in merchandising. As a former professor noted, &quot;She stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The young Ryan held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in <a href="Bullocks_Wilshire" title="wikilink">Bullock's-Wilshire</a> department store,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> taught typing and <a href="shorthand" class="uri" title="wikilink">shorthand</a> at a high school,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and supplemented her income by working as an extra in the film industry.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> She appeared as part of a brief walk-on in the 1935 film <em><a href="Becky_Sharp_(film)" title="wikilink">Becky Sharp</a></em>, as well as the 1936 film <em><a href="The_Great_Ziegfeld" title="wikilink">The Great Ziegfeld</a></em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met a young lawyer fresh out of <a href="Duke_University" title="wikilink">Duke University</a> law school, <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Milhous Nixon</a>. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in <em><a href="The_Dark_Tower_(play)" title="wikilink">The Dark Tower</a></em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Known as Dick, he asked Pat Ryan to marry him the first night they went out. &quot;I thought he was nuts or something!&quot; she recalled.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He courted the redhead he called his &quot;wild Irish Gypsy&quot; for two years,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> even driving her to and from her dates with other men. Eventually they married at the <a href="Mission_Inn" title="wikilink">Mission Inn</a> in <a href="Riverside,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside, California</a> on June 21, 1940. She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he &quot;was going places, he was vital and ambitious ... he was always doing things&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, &quot;Oh but you just don&lt;U+2019&gt;t realize how much fun he is!

<p>Veteran <a href="United_Press_International" title="wikilink">UPI</a> reporter <a href="Helen_Thomas" title="wikilink">Helen Thomas</a> suggested that in public, the Nixons &quot;moved through life ritualistically&quot;, but privately, however, they were &quot;very close&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In private, Richard Nixon was described as being &quot;unabashedly sentimental&quot;, often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Of his critics, she said that &quot;Lincoln had worse critics.

<h3 id="early-campaigns">Early campaigns</h3>
<p>Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when he entered politics, running successfully for a seat in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a>. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, <a href="Patricia_Nixon_Cox" title="wikilink">Patricia</a>, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, <a href="Julie_Nixon_Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Julie</a>. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, &quot;The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent <a href="Jerry_Voorhis" title="wikilink">Jerry Voorhis</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> She also wrote and distributed campaign literature.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent <a href="California&#39;s_12th_congressional_district" title="wikilink">California's 12th congressional district</a>. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a>, and then be nominated as <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">vice presidential</a> candidate.</p>
<p>Although Pat Nixon was a <a href="Methodist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Methodist</a>, she and her husband attended whichever <a href="Protestant_Church" title="wikilink">Protestant Church</a> was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional <a href="Baptist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baptist</a> services with the Reverend Dr. <a href="Billy_Graham" title="wikilink">Billy Graham</a>, and <a href="Norman_Vincent_Peale" title="wikilink">Norman Vincent Peale</a>'s Marble Collegiate Church.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed &quot;<a href="Checkers_speech" title="wikilink">Checkers speech</a>&quot;, so-called for the family's dog, a <a href="cocker_spaniel" title="wikilink">cocker spaniel</a> given them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> then said, &quot;I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

<p>Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad in his vice presidential years.

<p>A November 1, 1958 article in the <em><a href="Seattle_Times" title="wikilink">Seattle Times</a></em> was typical of the media's favorable coverage of the future First Lady, stating that &quot;Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct ... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been.&quot; A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> called her &quot;a paragon of wifely virtues&quot; whose &quot;efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation's Ideal Housewife (1957), and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband's suits one evening.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> &quot;Of course, I didn't have to,&quot; she told <em>The New York Times</em>, &quot;But when I don't have work to do, I just think up some new project.&quot;</p>

Pat was featured prominently in the campaign; an entire advertisement campaign was built around the slogan &quot;Pat for First Lady&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes&quot;, as one reporter put it.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1962, the Nixons embarked on another campaign, this time for <a href="Governor_of_California" title="wikilink">Governor of California</a>. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, &quot;Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to <a href="Pat_Brown" title="wikilink">Pat Brown</a>.</p>

<p>Pat Nixon had an interest in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on <a href="Jacqueline_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Jacqueline Kennedy</a>'s more publicized efforts. She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> She created the <a href="Map_Room_(White_House)" title="wikilink">Map Room</a> and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was not there.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Pat_Nixon_flowers.png" title="fig:Pat works with a florist on flower settings, December 1970." alt="Pat works with a florist on flower settings, December 1970." /> The First Lady had long been irritated with the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> she would routinely come down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, &quot;she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little known organizations...&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented.

<p>After hearing about the <a href="Great_Peruvian_Earthquake" title="wikilink">Great Peruvian Earthquake</a> of 1970, which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a &quot;volunteer American relief drive&quot; and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort,<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: &quot;Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done,&quot;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> and an editorial in Peru's <em>Lima Prensa</em> said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> <a href="Fran_Lewine" title="wikilink">Fran Lewine</a> of the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a &quot;mercy mission&quot; resulting in such &quot;diplomatic side effects&quot;.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the <a href="Order_of_the_Sun_(Peru)" title="wikilink">Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun</a>, the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="fashion-and-style">Fashion and style</h3>
<p><img src="Pat_Nixon_poses_1970.png" title="fig:Pat Nixon posing in the White House, 1970" alt="Pat Nixon posing in the White House, 1970" /> The fashion press tends to take special interest in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Mrs. Nixon was lively. <em><a href="Women&#39;s_Wear_Daily" title="wikilink">Women's Wear Daily</a></em> stated that Pat had a &quot;good figure and good posture&quot;, as well as &quot;the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today&quot;.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. &quot;I consider it my duty to use American designers&quot;, she said,<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> and favored them because, &quot;they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. &quot;I'm a size 10,&quot; she told <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>. &quot;I can just walk in and buy.

Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as &quot;a schoolteacher on her night out&quot;, but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, &quot;Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike.&quot;<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>Pat did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. &quot;Always before, it was sort of fun to get some ... thing that was completely different, high-style&quot;, she told a reporter. &quot;But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular.&quot;<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="watergate">Watergate</h3>

<p>At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Pat &quot;barely noticed&quot; the reports of a break-in at the <a href="Democratic_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Democratic National Committee</a> headquarters.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, &quot;I know only what I read in the newspapers.&quot;<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> In 1974, when a reporter asked &quot;Is the press the cause of the president's problems?&quot;, Pat shot back, &quot;What problems?&quot;<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Privately, Pat felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a>''</p>

<p>After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, Mrs. Nixon replied, &quot;But why?&quot;<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new <a href="White_House_china" title="wikilink">official china pattern</a> from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> On August 7, 1974, the family met in the <a href="Sunroom" title="wikilink">solarium</a> of the White House for their last dinner.

<p>The next morning, a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff took place in the East Room, during which the President read from <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s biography and praised his own parents.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President <a href="Gerald_Ford" title="wikilink">Gerald Ford</a> and Betty Ford to <em><a href="Marine_One" title="wikilink">Marine One</a></em>. As they walked, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, &quot;You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em.&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The helicopter carried them to <a href="Andrews_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Andrews Air Force Base</a>; from there they flew to California.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
