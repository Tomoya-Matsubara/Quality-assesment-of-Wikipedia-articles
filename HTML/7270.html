<p>Timur was in his lifetime a controversial figure, and remains so today. He sought to restore the Mongol Empire,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> yet his heaviest blow was against the Islamized Tatar <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>. He was more at home in an urban environment than on the <a href="steppe" class="uri" title="wikilink">steppe</a>. He styled himself a <a href="ghazi_(warrior)" title="wikilink">ghazi</a> while conducting wars that severely affected some Muslim states, in particular the <a href="Sultanate_of_Delhi" title="wikilink">Sultanate of Delhi</a>. A great patron of the arts, his campaigns also caused vast destruction. His military campaign is believed to have caused the deaths of 17 million people.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> His greatest military achievement is having defeated some of most powerful empires on the continents around the world such as the <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>, the <a href="Delhi_Sultanate" title="wikilink">Delhi Sultanate</a> of <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South Asia</a>, the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>, and the <a href="Mamluk_Sultanate_(Cairo)" title="wikilink">Mamluk Sultanate</a> of Egypt. Tamerlane as a military conqueror is within the ranks with Genghis Khan and with <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, making him one of the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s greatest conquerors. His armies were ferocious, feared throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-history">Early history</h2>
<p>Timur was born in <a href="Transoxiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transoxiana</a>, in the City of Kesh (an area now better known as <a href="Shahrisabz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shahrisabz</a>, &quot;the green city&quot;), some 50 miles south of <a href="Samarkand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarkand</a> in modern <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, then part of the <a href="Chagatai_Khanate" title="wikilink">Chagatai Khanate</a>. His father, Taraqai, was a small-scale landowner and belonged to the <a href="Barlas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barlas</a> tribe. The Barlas was a <a href="Turko-Mongol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turko-Mongol</a> tribe<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> which was originally a <a href="Mongols" title="wikilink">Mongol</a> tribe<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and was <a href="Turkification" title="wikilink">Turkified</a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and/or became <a href="Turkic_languages" title="wikilink">Turkic</a>-speaking<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> or intermingling with the Turkic peoples.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to <a href="G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard_Chaliand" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Chaliand</a>, Timur was a Muslim <a href="Turkic_people" title="wikilink">Turk</a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but he saw himself as <a href="Genghis_Khan" title="wikilink">Genghis Khan</a>'s heir.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Though not a <a href="Descent_from_Genghis_Khan" title="wikilink">Chinggisid</a>, he clearly sought to evoke the legacy of <a href="Genghis_Khan" title="wikilink">Genghis Khan</a>'s conquests during his lifetime.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Timur was a Muslim, but while his chief official religious counsellor and advisor was the <a href="Hanafite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanafite</a> scholar 'Abdu 'l-Jabbar Khwarazmi, his particular persuasion is not known. In Tirmidh, he had come under the influence of his spiritual mentor <a href="Sayyid_Barakah" title="wikilink">Sayyid Barakah</a>, a Shiite leader from <a href="Balkh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkh</a> who is buried alongside Timur in <a href="Gur-e_Amir" title="wikilink">Gur-e Amir</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Despite his Hanafi background, Timur was known to hold <a href="Ali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ali</a> and the <a href="Imamah_(Shi&#39;a_doctrine)" title="wikilink">Shia Imams</a> in high regard and has been noted by various scholars for his &quot;pro-<a href="Shia_Islam" title="wikilink">Alid</a>&quot; stance. Despite this, Timur was noted for attacking Shi&lt;U+2019&gt;is on Sunni grounds and therefore his own religious inclinations remain unclear.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="military-leader">Military leader</h2>
<p><img src="Timurid_Dynasty_821_-_873_(AH).png" title="fig:Map of the Timurid Empire" alt="Map of the Timurid Empire" width="350" /> In about 1360 Timur gained prominence as a military leader whose troops were mostly Turkic tribesmen of the region.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He took part in campaigns in Transoxiana with <a href="Chagatai_Khan" title="wikilink">the Khan</a> of <a href="Chagatai_Khanate" title="wikilink">Chagatai</a>, a fellow descendant of Genghis Khan. His career for the next ten or eleven years may be thus briefly summarized from the <em>Memoirs</em>. Allying himself both in cause and by family connection with Kurgan, the dethroner and destroyer of <a href="Volga_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Volga Bulgaria</a>, he was to invade <a href="Greater_Khorasan" title="wikilink">Khorasan</a> at the head of a thousand horsemen. This was the second military expedition which he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of <a href="Khorezm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khorezm</a> and <a href="Urgench" title="wikilink">Urganj</a>.</p>
<p>After the murder of Kurgan the disputes which arose among the many claimants to <a href="sovereign" class="uri" title="wikilink">sovereign</a> power were halted by the invasion of the energetic Jagataite <a href="Tughlugh_Temur" title="wikilink">Tughlugh Temur</a> of <a href="Kashgar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kashgar</a>, another descendant of Genghis Khan. Timur was dispatched on a mission to the invader's camp, the result of which was his own appointment to the head of his own tribe, the <a href="Barlas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barlas</a>, in place of its former leader, <a href="Hajji_Beg" title="wikilink">Hajji Beg</a>.</p>
<p>The exigencies of Timur's quasi-sovereign position compelled him to have recourse to his formidable patron, whose reappearance on the banks of the <a href="Syr_Darya" title="wikilink">Syr Darya</a> created a consternation not easily allayed. The Barlas were taken from Timur and entrusted to a son of Tughluk, along with the rest of <a href="Mawarannahr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mawarannahr</a> (Transoxiana); but he was defeated in battle by the bold warrior he had replaced at the head of a numerically far inferior force. </p>
<h2 id="rise-to-power">Rise to power</h2>
<p><img src="Timur_during_attack_on_Balkh_1370.jpg" title="fig:Timur commanding the Siege of Balkh." alt="Timur commanding the Siege of Balkh." /> Tughlugh's death facilitated the work of reconquest, and a few years of perseverance and energy sufficed for its accomplishment, as well as for the addition of a vast extent of territory. It was in this period that Timur reduced the <a href="Chagatai_Khanate" title="wikilink">Chagatai khans</a> to the position of figureheads, who were deferred to in theory but in reality ignored, while Timur ruled in their name. During this period Timur and his brother-in-law Husayn, at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures full of interest and romance, became rivals and antagonists. At the close of 1369 Husayn was assassinated and Timur, having been formally proclaimed sovereign at <a href="Balkh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkh</a>, mounted the throne at Samarkand, the capital of his dominions. This event was recorded by Marlowe in his famous play <em>Tamburlaine the Great</em>:<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>  A legendary account of Timur's rise to leadership, recorded among the <a href="Tatars#Siberian_Tatars" title="wikilink">Tatar</a> descendants of the <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Q&lt;U+0131&gt;pchaq Khanate</a> in <a href="Tobolsk" title="wikilink">Tobol</a>, goes as follows:<br />
One day Aksak Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;r<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> spoke thusly:  It is notable that Timur never claimed for himself the title of <a href="Khan_(title)" title="wikilink">khan</a>, styling himself <a href="amir" class="uri" title="wikilink">amir</a> and acting in the name of the <a href="Chagatai_Khanate" title="wikilink">Chagatai</a> ruler of Transoxania. Timur was a military genius, but was sometimes lacking in political sense. He tended not to leave a government apparatus behind in lands he conquered and was often faced with the need to reconquer such lands after inevitable rebellions had taken place.</p>

<p>Timur spent the next 35 years in various <a href="List_of_wars" title="wikilink">wars</a> and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the <a href="Caspian_Sea" title="wikilink">Caspian Sea</a> and to the banks of the <a href="Ural_River" title="wikilink">Ural</a> and the <a href="Volga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volga</a>. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in <a href="Persia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persia</a>, including <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Karbala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karbala</a> and Northern Iraq.</p>
<p>One of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named <a href="Tokhtamysh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokhtamysh</a>. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, <a href="Tokhtamysh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokhtamysh</a> became ruler both of the eastern <a href="White_Horde" title="wikilink">Kipchak</a> and the <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>. After his accession, he then quarrelled with Timur over the possession of <a href="Khiva" title="wikilink">Khwarizm</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>. However, Timur still supported him against the Russians and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and burned <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>After the death of <a href="Abu_Sa&#39;id_(Ilkhanid_dynasty)" title="wikilink">Abu Sa'id</a>, ruler of the <a href="Ilkhanid_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ilkhanid Dynasty</a>, in 1335, there was a power vacuum in <a href="Persia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persia</a>. In 1383 Timur started the military conquest of Persia. He captured <a href="Herat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herat</a>, Khorasan and all eastern Persia by 1385 and captured almost all of Persia by 1387. These conquests were characterised by exceptional brutality. For example, when <a href="Isfahan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isfahan</a> surrendered to Timur in 1387, he initially treated it with relative mercy as he commonly did with cities that surrendered without resistance. However, after the city revolted against Timur's punitive taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, Timur ordered the complete massacre of the city, killing a reported 70,000 citizens. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers, each constructed of about 1,500 heads.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the <a href="Golden_Horde" title="wikilink">Golden Horde</a>, turned against his patron and invaded <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a> in 1385. This action would cause a counter by Timur that would become the <a href="Tokhtamysh&lt;U+2013&gt;Timur_war" title="wikilink">Tokhtamysh&lt;U+2013&gt;Timur war</a>. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Kondurcha_River" title="wikilink">Battle of the Kondurcha River</a>, however Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur then invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned <a href="Ryazan" title="wikilink">Raizan</a> and advanced upon Moscow, only to be pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the uninhabited steppe, then west about 1,000 miles, advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. The <a href="Timurid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Timurid</a> army almost starved, and Timur organized a great hunt where the army encircled vast areas of steppe to get food. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the <a href="Orenburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orenburg</a> region and destroyed at the previously mentioned <a href="Battle_of_the_Kondurcha_River" title="wikilink">Battle of the Kondurcha River</a>. During this march, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of <a href="midnight_sun" title="wikilink">very long summer days</a>, causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of <a href="salat" title="wikilink">prayers</a> in such northern regions.</p>
<p>It was in the second phase of the conflict that Timur took an easier route against the enemy, invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the Caucasus region. The year 1395, saw the <a href="Battle_of_the_Terek_River" title="wikilink">Battle of the Terek River</a>, when Tokhtamysh's power was finally broken, concluding the titanic struggle between the two monarchs.</p>
<p>Tokhtamysh was not able to restore his power or prestige. He was killed about a decade after the Terek River battle in the area of present day <a href="Tyumen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyumen</a>, by agents of an emir named <a href="Edigu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edigu</a>.</p>
<p>Timur during the course of his campaigns destroyed <a href="Sarai_(city)" title="wikilink">Sarai</a>, the capital of the Golden Horde, and <a href="Astrakhan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astrakhan</a>, subsequently wrecking the Golden Horde's economy based on <a href="Silk_Road" title="wikilink">Silk Road</a> trade. The Golden Horde saw political disintegration after such losses, with Mongol unity in the region shattered permanently.</p>
<p>In May 1393 Timur invaded the <a href="Anjudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjudan</a>, crippling the <a href="Ismaili" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ismaili</a> village only one year after his assault on the Ismailis in <a href="Mazandaran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mazandaran</a>. The village appears to have been prepared for attack, as it contained a fortress and an intricate system of underground tunnels. These devices were, however, unsuccessful in thwarting Timur&lt;U+2019&gt;s soldiers, who flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur&lt;U+2019&gt;s reasons for attacking this village are not yet well-understood, however it has been suggested that his <a href="Timur#Personal_life" title="wikilink">religious persuasions</a> and view of himself as an <a href="Timur#Indian_campaign" title="wikilink">executor of divine will</a> may have contributed to his motivations.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Persian historian <a href="Khwandamir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khwandamir</a> explains that an Ismaili presence was growing more politically powerful in Persian <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>. A group among the locals in this region was dissatisfied with this. Khwandamir writes that some of these locals assembled and brought up their complaint with Timur, possibly provoking his attack on the Ismailis there.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1398 Timur invaded northern India, attacking the <a href="Delhi_Sultanate" title="wikilink">Delhi Sultanate</a> ruled by <a href="Sultan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sultan</a> Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the <a href="Tughlaq_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tughlaq Dynasty</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The cambridge history says that he was opposed by <a href="Ahirs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ahirs</a> and <a href="Jats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jats</a> but Delhi Government did nothing to stop him.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> After crossing the <a href="Indus_river" title="wikilink">Indus river</a> on September 30, 1398, he sacked <a href="Tulamba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tulamba</a> and massacred its inhabitants.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Then he advanced and captured <a href="Multan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Multan</a> by October.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>His campaign was officially justified by claims that the Muslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its <a href="Hindu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> subjects, but was motivated greatly by the considerable wealth to be gained. By all accounts, Timur's campaigns in India were marked by systematic slaughter and other atrocities on a truly massive scale inflicted mainly on the subcontinent's Hindu population.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Timur crossed the <a href="Indus_River" title="wikilink">Indus River</a> at <a href="Attock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Attock</a> (now <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>) on September 24, 1398, but Timur's <a href="invasion" class="uri" title="wikilink">invasion</a> did not go unopposed and he did meet some resistance during his march to Delhi, by the <a href="Governor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Governor</a> of <a href="Meerut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meerut</a>. Timur was able to continue his relentless approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398 to combat the armies of Sultan Mehmud, already weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.</p>
<p>The Sultan's army was easily defeated on December 17, 1398. On this day the army of Sultan Mahmud Khan had prepared 120 war elephants armored with chain mail. He had put poison on the tusks, which put fright into the Tatar lines. Timur took action and the Tatars dug out a trench in front of their positions. Timur then took his camels and placed all the wood and hay he could on their backs. When the war elephants charged he lit the camels on fire and then prodded them with iron sticks. They charged at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of the burning camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives:<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;At this Court Am&lt;U+00ED&gt;r Jah&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Sh&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and Am&lt;U+00ED&gt;r Sulaim&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Sh&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, and other am&lt;U+00ED&gt;rs of experience, brought to my notice that, from the time of entering Hindust&lt;U+00E1&gt;n up to the present time, we had taken more than 100,000 infidels and prisoners, and that they were all in my camp. On the previous day, when the enemy's forces made the attack upon us, the prisoners made signs of rejoicing, uttered imprecations against us, and were ready, as soon as they heard of the enemy's success, to form themselves into a body, break their bonds, plunder our tents, and then to go and join the enemy, and so increase his numbers and strength. I asked their advice about the prisoners, and they said that on the great day of battle these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage, and that it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters and foes of Isl&lt;U+00E1&gt;m at liberty. In fact, no other course remained but that of making them all food for the sword. When I heard these words I found them in accordance with the rules of war, and I directly gave my command for the Taw&lt;U+00E1&gt;ch&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to proclaim throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners was to put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the gh&lt;U+00E1&gt;z&lt;U+00ED&gt;s of Isl&lt;U+00E1&gt;m, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain.

<p>&quot;On the 16th of the month some incidents occurred which led to the sack of the city of Delh&lt;U+00ED&gt;, and to the slaughter of many of the infidel inhabitants. One was this. A party of fierce Turk soldiers had assembled at one of the gates of the city to look about them and enjoy themselves, and some of them laid violent hands upon the goods of the inhabitants. When I heard of this violence, I sent some am&lt;U+00ED&gt;rs, who were present in the city, to restrain the Turks. A party of soldiers accompanied these am&lt;U+00ED&gt;rs into the city. Another reason was that some of the ladies of my harem expressed a wish to go into the city and see the palace of Haz&lt;U+00E1&gt;r-sut&lt;U+00FA&gt;n (thousand columns) which Malik Jaun&lt;U+00E1&gt; built in the fort called Jah&lt;U+00E1&gt;n-pan&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. I granted this request, and I sent a party of soldiers to escort the litters of the ladies. Another reason was that Jal&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Isl&lt;U+00E1&gt;m and other d&lt;U+00ED&gt;w&lt;U+00E1&gt;ns had gone into the city with a party of soldiers to collect the contribution laid upon the city. Another reason was that some thousand troopers with orders for grain, oil, sugar, and flour, had gone into the city to collect these supplies. Another reason was that it had come to my knowledge that great numbers of gabrs, with their wives and children, and goods, and valuables, had come into the city from all the country round, and consequently I had sent some am&lt;U+00ED&gt;rs with their regiments (kush&lt;U+00FA&gt;n) into the city and directed them to pay no attention to the remonstrances of the inhabitants, but to seize and bring out these fugitives. For these several reasons a great number of fierce Turk&lt;U+00ED&gt; soldiers were in the city. When the soldiers proceeded to apprehend the Hindus and gabrs who had fled to the city, many of them drew their swords and offered resistance. The flames of strife were thus lighted and spread through the whole city from Jah&lt;U+00E1&gt;n-pan&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and S&lt;U+00ED&gt;r&lt;U+00ED&gt; to Old Dehl&lt;U+00ED&gt;, burning up all it reached. The savage Turks fell to killing and plundering. The am&lt;U+00ED&gt;rs who were in charge of the gates prevented any more soldiers from going into the place, but the flames of war had risen too high for this precaution to be of any avail in extinguishing them. On that day, Thursday, and all the night of Friday, nearly 15,000 Turks were engaged in slaying, plundering, and destroying. When morning broke on the Friday, all my army, no longer under control, went off to the city and thought of nothing but killing, plundering, and making prisoners. All that day the sack was general. The following day, Saturday, the 17th, all passed in the same way, and the spoil was so great that each man secured from fifty to a hundred prisoners, men, women, and children. There was no man who took less than twenty. The other booty was immense in rubies, diamonds, garnets, pearls, and other gems; jewels of gold and silver; ashraf&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, tankas of gold and silver of the celebrated 'Al&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt; coinage; vessels of gold and silver; and brocades and silks of great value. Gold and silver ornaments of the Hindu women were obtained in such quantities as to exceed all account. Excepting the quarter of the saiyids, the 'ulam&lt;U+00E1&gt;, and the other Musulm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ns, the whole city was sacked. The pen of fate had written down this destiny for the people of this city. Although I was desirous of sparing them I could not succeed, for it was the will of Allah that this calamity should fall upon the city.&quot;</p>

<p>Timur left Delhi in December 1398 and marched on <a href="Meerut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meerut</a>. Then he rode up to <a href="Haridwar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haridwar</a> and sacked the holy city on January 23, 1399. Before he crossed the Ganges, he faced stiff resistance from natives at <a href="Bhokarhedi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bhokarhedi</a>. In April he had returned to his own capital beyond the <a href="Oxus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxus</a> (Amu Darya). Immense quantities of spoils and slaves were taken from India. According to <a href="Ruy_Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;les_de_Clavijo" title="wikilink">Ruy Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;les de Clavijo</a>, 90 captured <a href="elephants" class="uri" title="wikilink">elephants</a> were employed merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest, so as to erect a <a href="mosque" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosque</a> at Samarkandwhat historians today believe is the enormous <a href="Bibi-Khanym_Mosque" title="wikilink">Bibi-Khanym Mosque</a>.</p>

Bayezid began annexing the territory of Turkmen and Muslim rulers in <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a>. As Timur claimed sovereignty over the <a href="Turkmen_people" title="wikilink">Turkmen</a> rulers, they took refuge behind him. Timur invaded Syria, sacked <a href="Aleppo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aleppo</a> and captured <a href="Damascus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damascus</a> after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans, who were deported to Samarkand. This led to Timur's being publicly declared an enemy of Islam, as he was no longer killing only non-Muslims. However, <a href="Ibn_Khaldun" title="wikilink">Ibn Khaldun</a> praises Timur for having unified much of the Muslim world when other conquerors of the time could not.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In a form of rectification, in 1400 Timur <a href="Timur&#39;s_invasions_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">invaded</a> Christian <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> and <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. Of the surviving population, more than 60,000 <a href="Peoples_of_the_Caucasus" title="wikilink">of the local people</a> were captured as slaves, and many districts were depopulated.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>He invaded <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a> in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. (Many <a href="warrior" title="wikilink">warriors</a> were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Finally, Timur invaded Anatolia and defeated Bayezid in the <a href="Battle_of_Ankara" title="wikilink">Battle of Ankara</a> on July 20, 1402. Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the 12-year <a href="Ottoman_Interregnum" title="wikilink">Ottoman Interregnum</a> period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of <a href="Seljuq_dynasty" title="wikilink">Seljuq</a> authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a> as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur's interest with Genghizid legitimacy.</p>
<p>After the Ankara victory, Timur's army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror. But Timur did take the city of Smyrna, a stronghold of the Christian <a href="Knights_Hospitalers" title="wikilink">Knights Hospitalers</a>, thus he referred to himself as <em><a href="ghazi_warriors" title="wikilink">ghazi</a></em> or &quot;Warrior of Islam&quot;.</p>
<p>Timur was furious at the <a href="Republic_of_Genoa" title="wikilink">Genoese</a> and <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Venetians</a> whose ships ferried the Ottoman army to safety in <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>. As <a href="Lord_Kinross" title="wikilink">Lord Kinross</a> reported in <em>The Ottoman Centuries</em>, the Italians preferred the enemy they could handle to the one they could not.</p>
<p><img src="Tomb_of_the_Family_of_Tamerlane_in_Samarcande.jpg" title="fig:Tamerlane&#39;s tomb seen from a distance" alt="Tamerlane&#39;s tomb seen from a distance" /> By 1368, the new Chinese <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a> had driven the <a href="Yuan_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Mongols</a> out of <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>. The first <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming</a> Emperor <a href="Hongwu_Emperor" title="wikilink">Hongwu</a>, and his successor <a href="Yongle_Emperor" title="wikilink">Yongle</a> demanded, and received, homage from many Central Asian states as the political heirs to the former House of <a href="Kublai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kublai</a>. The Ming emperor's attempts to treat Timur as a <a href="vassal" class="uri" title="wikilink">vassal</a> did not go well: when in 1394 Hongwu's ambassadors presented Timur with a letter addressing him in this way, he had the ambassadors <a href="Fu_An" title="wikilink">Fu An</a>, Guo Ji, and Liu Wei detained, and their 1,500 guards executed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Neither Hongwu's next ambassador, <a href="Chen_Dewen" title="wikilink">Chen Dewen</a> (1397) nor the delegation announcing the accession of the Yongle Emperor fared any better.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Timur eventually planned to conquer China. To this end, Timur made an alliance with the <a href="Mongols" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongols</a> of the <a href="Northern_Yuan_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Northern Yuan Dynasty</a> and prepared all the way to Bukhara. The Mongol leader <a href="Engke_Khan,_Emperor_Xingyuan_of_Northern_Yuan" title="wikilink">Enkhe Khan</a> sent his grandson <a href="&lt;U+00D6&gt;ljei_Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;r_Khan" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D6&gt;ljei Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;r</a>, also known as Buyanshir Khan. In December 1404, Timur started military campaigns against the Ming Dynasty and detained the Ming envoy, but he was attacked by fever and plague when encamped on the farther side of the Sihon (<a href="Syr-Daria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syr-Daria</a>) and died at Atrar (<a href="Otrar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Otrar</a>) on February 17, 1405,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> without ever reaching the Chinese border.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Only after that were the Ming envoys released.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Timur's scouts explored <a href="Mongolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongolia</a> before his death, and the writing they carved on trees in Mongolia's mountains could still be seen even in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Although he preferred to fight his battles in the spring, Timur died enroute during an uncharacteristic winter campaign against the ruling Chinese <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a>. It was one of the bitterest winters on record; his troops are recorded as having to dig through five feet of ice to reach drinking water. Records indicate though, that for part of his life at least, he was a surreptitious Ming <a href="vassal" class="uri" title="wikilink">vassal</a> and that his son <a href="Shah_Rukh_(Timurid_dynasty)" title="wikilink">Shah Rukh</a> visited <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> in 1420.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> He ruled over an empire that, in modern times, extends from southeastern <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>, <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>, and <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a>, through <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a> encompassing part of <a href="Kazakhstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Kyrgyzstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, and even approaches <a href="Kashgar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kashgar</a> in China. The conquests of Timur are claimed to have caused the deaths of up to 17 million people; an assertion impossible to verify.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Timur's campaigns sometimes caused large and permanent demographic changes, northern Iraq remained predominantly <a href="East_Syrian_Rite" title="wikilink">Assyrian Christian</a> until attacked, looted, plundered and destroyed by Timur leaving its population decimated by systematic mass slaughter.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Of Timur's four sons, two (Jahangir and Umar Shaykh) predeceased him. His third son, <a href="Miran_Shah" title="wikilink">Miran Shah</a>, died soon after Timur, leaving the youngest son, Shah Rukh. Although his designated successor was his grandson <a href="Pir_Muhammad" title="wikilink">Pir Muhammad</a> b. Jahangir, Timur was ultimately succeeded in power by his son Shah Rukh. His most illustrious descendant <a href="Babur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babur</a> founded the Islamic <a href="Mughal_Empire" title="wikilink">Mughal Empire</a> and ruled over most of <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="North_India" title="wikilink">North India</a>.

<p>Markham, in his introduction to the narrative of Clavijo's embassy, states that his body &quot;was embalmed with musk and rose water, wrapped in linen, laid in an ebony coffin and sent to <a href="Samarkand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarkand</a>, where it was buried.&quot; His tomb, the <a href="Gur-e_Amir" title="wikilink">Gur-e Amir</a>, still stands in Samarkand, though it has been heavily restored in recent years.</p>

<p>Timur became widely known as a patron to the arts. Much of the architecture he commissioned still stands in <a href="Samarkand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarkand</a>, now in present-day <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>. He was known to bring the most talented artisans from the lands he conquered back to Samarkand, and is credited with often giving them a wide latitude of artistic freedom to express themselves. He also constructed one of his finest buildings at the tomb of <a href="Ahmed_Yesevi" title="wikilink">Ahmed Yesevi</a>, an influential Turkic <a href="Sufi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sufi</a> <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> who spread <a href="Sufi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sufi</a> <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a> among the nomads.</p>
<p>According to legend, Omar Aqta, Timur's court <a href="arabic_calligraphy" title="wikilink">calligrapher</a>, transcribed the <a href="Qur&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qur'an</a> using letters so small that the entire text of the book fit on a <a href="signet_ring" title="wikilink">signet ring</a>. Omar also is said to have created a Qur'an so large that a <a href="wheelbarrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">wheelbarrow</a> was required to transport it. <a href="Bookbinding" title="wikilink">Folios</a> of what is probably this larger Qur'an have been found, written in gold lettering on huge pages.</p>
<p>Timur was also said to have created <a href="Tamerlane_Chess" title="wikilink">Tamerlane Chess</a>, a variant of <a href="shatranj" class="uri" title="wikilink">shatranj</a> (also known as <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> <a href="chess" class="uri" title="wikilink">chess</a>) played on a larger board with several additional pieces and an original method of pawn promotion. These pieces included the camel, siege-weapon, giraffe, and several others as well as boasting a complicated system involving the ability to exchange pawns for certain pieces should they reach the other side of the board.</p>
<p>Timur's mandating of <a href="Kurash" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kurash</a> wrestling for his soldiers ensured for it a lasting and legendary legacy. Kurash is now a popular international sport and part of the <a href="Asian_Games" title="wikilink">Asian Games</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exchanges-with-europe">Exchanges with Europe</h2>

<p><img src="Letter_of_Tamerlane_to_Charles_VI_1402.jpg" title="fig:Letter of Timur to Charles VI of France, 1402, a witness to Timurid relations with Europe." alt="Letter of Timur to Charles VI of France, 1402, a witness to Timurid relations with Europe." /> Timur had numerous epistolary and diplomatic exchanges with Western, especially Spanish and French, rulers. There was the possibility of an alliance between Timur and the European states, against the Ottoman Turks that were attacking Europe. Therefore, there was a clear motive for Timur, who wanted to surround his Ottoman and Mamluk enemies in this offensive alliance.</p>
<p>The relations between the courts of <a href="Henry_III_of_Castile" title="wikilink">Henry III of Castile</a> and that of Timur constituted the most important episode of the medieval Spanish <a href="Kingdom_of_Castile" title="wikilink">Castilian</a> diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the Battle of Ankara, two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of <a href="Kingdom_of_Castile" title="wikilink">Castile</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> a <a href="Chagatai_Khanate" title="wikilink">Chagatay</a> ambassador named <a href="Hajji_Muhammad_al-Qazi" title="wikilink">Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi</a> with letters and gifts.</p>
<p>In return, the King Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in <a href="Samarkand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samarkand</a> in 1403-06, led by <a href="Ruy_Gonzales_de_Clavijo" title="wikilink">Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo</a>, with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile &quot;as his very own son&quot;.</p>
<p>According to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the &quot;lord of <a href="Cathay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cathay</a>&quot; (i.e., the <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a> <a href="Yongle_Emperor" title="wikilink">Yongle Emperor</a>), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from <a href="Cathay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cathay</a> (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of <a href="Marco_Polo" title="wikilink">Marco Polo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p><img src="Amir_TemurZoomed.jpg" title="fig:Statue of Timur in his birthplace of Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan." alt="Statue of Timur in his birthplace of Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan." />  Timur's legacy is a mixed one. While Central Asia blossomed under his reign, other places such as <a href="Baghdad#Early_invaders" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Damascus#Timurlank" title="wikilink">Damascus</a>, <a href="Delhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delhi</a> and other Arab, <a href="Timur&#39;s_invasions_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">Georgian</a>, Persian and Indian cities were sacked and destroyed and their populations massacred. He was responsible for the effective destruction of the Christian Church in much of Asia. Thus, while Timur still retains a positive image in <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a>, <a href="Persia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persia</a>, and <a href="Arab_countries" title="wikilink">Arab countries</a>, he is vilified by many in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, where some of his greatest atrocities were carried out. In the Islamic world at the time, he was variously considered both as a <a href="ghazi_warriors" title="wikilink">ghazi</a> (or &quot;Warrior for Islam&quot;) by some, and as an enemy of Islam by others.</p>
<p>Timur's military talents were unique. He planned all his campaigns years in advance, even planting barley for horse feed two-years ahead of his campaigns. He used <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a>, in what is now called <a href="information_warfare" title="wikilink">information warfare</a>, as part of his tactics. His campaigns were preceded by the deployment of spies whose tasks included collecting information and spreading horrifying reports about the cruelty, size, and might of Timur&lt;U+2019&gt;s armies. Such psychological warfare eventually weakened the morale of threatened populations and caused panic in the regions that he intended to invade.</p>
<p>Although Timur's uncharacteristic (for the time) concern for his troops inspired fierce loyalty, he did not pay them. Their only incentives were from looting captured territory &lt;U+2014&gt; a bounty that included horses, women, precious metals and stones; in other words whatever they, or their newly captured slaves, could carry away from the conquered lands.</p>
<p>Timur's short-lived empire also melded the <a href="Turko-Persian_tradition" title="wikilink">Turko-Persian tradition</a> in <a href="Transoxiania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transoxiania</a>, and in most of the territories which he incorporated into his <a href="fiefdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiefdom</a>, <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> became the primary <a href="language" class="uri" title="wikilink">language</a> of administration and literary culture (<em><a href="divan" title="wikilink">diwan</a></em>), regardless of <a href="ethnicity" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethnicity</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as a result. A literary form of <a href="Chaghatai_language" title="wikilink">Chagatai Turkic</a> came into use alongside Persian as both a cultural and an official language.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Timur became a relatively popular figure in Europe for centuries after his death, mainly because of his victory over the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid. The Ottoman armies were at the time invading Eastern Europe and Timur was ironically seen as a sort of ally.</p>
<p>Timur has now been officially recognized as a national hero of newly independent <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>. His monument in Tashkent now occupies the place where <a href="Marx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marx</a>'s statue once stood.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="biographies">Biographies</h3>
<p><img src="Emir_Timur_statue_-_Tashkent.jpg" title="fig:Statue of Timur in Tashkent." alt="Statue of Timur in Tashkent." /> Timur's generally recognized biographers are Ali Yazdi, commonly called <a href="Sharaf_ad-Din_Ali_Yazdi" title="wikilink">Sharaf ud-Din</a>, author of the <em><a href="Zafar-Nameh" title="wikilink">Zafarn&lt;U+0101&gt;meh</a></em> (), translated by Petis de la Croix in 1722, and from <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> into <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> by J. Darby in the following year; and Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah, al-Dimashiqi, al-Ajami (commonly called <a href="Ahmad_Ibn_Arabshah" title="wikilink">Ahmad Ibn Arabshah</a>) translated by the Dutch Orientalist Colitis in 1636. In the work of the former, as <a href="William_Jones_(philologist)" title="wikilink">Sir William Jones</a> remarks, &quot;the Tatarian conqueror is represented as a liberal, benevolent and illustrious prince&quot;, in that of the latter he is &quot;deformed and impious, of a low birth and detestable principles.&quot; But the favourable account was written under the personal supervision of Timur's grandson, Ibrahim, while the other was the production of his direst enemy.</p>
<p>Among less reputed biographies or materials for biography may be mentioned a second <em><a href="Zafar-Nameh" title="wikilink">Zafarn&lt;U+0101&gt;meh</a></em>, by Nizam al-Din Shami, stated to be the earliest known history of Timur, and the only one written in his lifetime. Timur's purported autobiography, the <em><a href="Tuzk-e-Taimuri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tuzk-e-Taimuri</a></em> (&quot;Memoirs of Temur&quot;) is a later fabrication, although most of the historical facts are accurate.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>More recent biographies include <a href="Justin_Marozzi" title="wikilink">Justin Marozzi</a>'s <em>Tamerlane: Sword of Islam, Conqueror of the World</em> (2006)<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and Roy Stier's <em>Tamerlane: The Ultimate Warrior</em> (1998).<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="exhumation">Exhumation</h3>
<p>Timurlane's body was <a href="Burial#Exhumation" title="wikilink">exhumed</a> from his tomb in 1941 by the <a href="USSR" title="wikilink">Soviet</a> <a href="anthropology" title="wikilink">anthropologist</a> <a href="Mikhail_Mikhaylovich_Gerasimov" title="wikilink">Mikhail M. Gerasimov</a>. From his bones it was clear that Timur was a tall and broad chested man with strong cheek bones. Gerasimov reconstructed the likeness of Timur from his <a href="Human_skull" title="wikilink">skull</a>. His height was 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters), very tall for his era. He also confirmed Timur's lameness due to a hip injury. Gerasimov also found that Timur's facial characteristics conformed to general Mongoloid features.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the study of &quot;Anthropological composition of the population of Central Asia&quot; shows the cranium of Timur predominate the characters of the South Siberian Mongoloid type.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Timurlane is classified as being closer to the Mongoloid race with some admixture.</p>
<p>It is alleged that Timur's tomb was inscribed with the words, &quot;When I rise from the dead, the world shall tremble.&quot; It is also said that when Gerasimov exhumed the body, an additional inscription inside the casket was found reading, &quot;Who ever opens my tomb, shall unleash an invader more terrible than I.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In any case, two days after Gerasimov had begun the exhumation, Nazi Germany launched <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a>, its invasion of the U.S.S.R.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Timur was re-buried with full Islamic ritual in November 1942 just before the Soviet victory at the <a href="Battle_of_Stalingrad" title="wikilink">Battle of Stalingrad</a> (ref Marozzi 2004).</p>

In fact, it is difficult to define the sphere of either side of the administration and we find Persians and Chaghatays sharing many tasks. (In discussing the settled bureaucracy and the people who worked within it I use the word Persian in a cultural rather than ethnological sense. In almost all the territories which Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;r incorporated into his realm Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled 'diwan' was Persian and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.) Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;r's Chaghatay emirs were often involved in civil and provincial administration and even in financial affairs, traditionally the province of Persian bureaucracy.&quot;<a href="#fnref59" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
