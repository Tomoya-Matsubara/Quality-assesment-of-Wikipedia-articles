<p><strong>Daniel Webster</strong> (January 18, 1782 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 24, 1852) was a leading American <a href="statesman" class="uri" title="wikilink">statesman</a> during the nation's <a href="Antebellum_Age" title="wikilink">Antebellum Period</a>. He first rose to regional prominence through his defense of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> shipping interests. His increasingly <a href="nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalistic</a> views and the effectiveness with which he articulated them led Webster to become one of the most famous orators and influential <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig</a> leaders of the <a href="Second_Party_System" title="wikilink">Second Party System</a>. As a leader of the <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig Party</a>, he was one of the nation's most prominent <a href="Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conservatives</a>, leading opposition to Democrat <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a> and the <a href="History_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic party</a>. He was a spokesman for modernization, banking and industry. He was an acknowledged elitist.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During his forty years in national politics Webster served in the House of Representatives for ten years (representing New Hampshire), the Senate for nineteen years (representing Massachusetts), and served as Secretary of State for three presidents.</p>
<p>Daniel Webster was one of the most successful <a href="Attorney_at_law_(United_States)" title="wikilink">lawyers</a> of the era, appearing in several key Supreme Court cases that established important constitutional precedents that bolstered the authority of the federal government. As <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a>, he negotiated the <a href="Webster-Ashburton_Treaty" title="wikilink">Webster-Ashburton Treaty</a> that established the definitive <a href="Canada&lt;U+2013&gt;United_States_border" title="wikilink">eastern border</a> between the United States and Canada. Primarily recognized for his <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> tenure, Webster was a key figure in the institution's &quot;Golden days&quot;. So well-known was his skill as a Senator throughout this period that Webster became the northern member of a trio known as the &quot;<a href="Great_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">Great Triumvirate</a>&quot;, with his colleagues <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a> from the west and <a href="John_C._Calhoun" title="wikilink">John C. Calhoun</a> from the south. His <a href="Webster-Hayne_debate" title="wikilink">&quot;Reply to Hayne&quot;</a> in 1830 was generally regarded as &quot;the most eloquent speech ever delivered in <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>As with his fellow Whig <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a>, Webster's desire to see the Union preserved and civil war averted led him to search out compromises designed to stave off the sectionalism that threatened war between the <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">North</a> and <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">South</a>. Webster tried and failed three times for the White House. Webster was widely esteemed and was officially named by the U.S. Senate in 1957 as one of its five most outstanding members.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Daniel was born on January 18, 1782, to Ebenezer and Abigail Webster (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Eastman) in <a href="Salisbury,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Salisbury</a>, <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>, now part of the city of <a href="Franklin,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Franklin</a>. There he and his nine siblings were raised on his parents' farm, a small parcel of land granted to his father. Daniel Webster's great-great-grandfather was Thomas Webster<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (1631&lt;U+2013&gt;1715), who was born in <a href="Ormesby_St._Margaret" title="wikilink">Ormesby St. Margaret</a>, <a href="Norfolk,_England" title="wikilink">Norfolk, England</a> and settled in New Hampshire. As Daniel was a &quot;sickly child&quot;, his family indulged him, exempting him from the harsh rigors of 18th-century <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> farm life.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

After he graduated from Dartmouth (Phi Beta Kappa), Webster was apprenticed to the lawyer <a href="Thomas_W._Thompson" title="wikilink">Thomas W. Thompson</a>. When his older brother's own quest for education put a financial strain on the family that consequently required Webster's support, Webster was forced to resign and become a schoolmaster &lt;U+2014&gt; as young men often did then, when <a href="Public_education_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">public education</a> consisted largely of subsidies to local schoolmasters. In 1802 he served as the headmaster of the <a href="Fryeburg_Academy" title="wikilink">Fryeburg Academy</a>, <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a>, for the period of one year.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> When his brother's education could no longer be sustained, Webster returned to his apprenticeship. He left New Hampshire and got employment in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> under the prominent attorney <a href="Christopher_Gore" title="wikilink">Christopher Gore</a> in 1804. Clerking for Gore &lt;U+2014&gt; who was involved in international, national, and state politics &lt;U+2014&gt; Webster educated himself on various political subjects and met New England politicians.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1805 Webster was <a href="Admission_to_the_bar_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">accepted into the bar</a> and returned to New Hampshire to set up a practice in <a href="Boscawen,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Boscawen</a>, in part to be near his ailing father. During this time, Webster took a more active interest in politics. Raised by an ardently <a href="Federalist_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Federalist</a> father and taught by a predominantly Federalist-leaning faculty at <a href="Dartmouth_College" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a>, Webster, like many New Englanders, supported Federalism. Accordingly, he accepted a number of minor local speaking engagements in support of Federalist causes and candidates.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> [[<a href="File:Daniel" class="uri">File:Daniel</a> Webster 1890 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|left|200px|</p>

<p>]] After his father's death in 1806, Webster handed over his practice to his older brother Ezekiel, who had by this time finished his schooling and been admitted to the bar. Webster then moved to the larger town of <a href="Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Portsmouth</a> in 1807, and opened a practice there.&lt;ref name=Discovering Biography, &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; /&gt; During this time the <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a> began to affect Americans, as <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">Britain</a> began to forcibly <a href="impressment" title="wikilink">impress</a> American sailors into their Navy. President <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> retaliated with the <a href="Embargo_Act_of_1807" title="wikilink">Embargo Act of 1807</a>, ceasing all trade to both Britain and <a href="First_French_Empire" title="wikilink">France</a>. New England was heavily reliant upon commerce with the two nations and the region vehemently opposed Jefferson's attempt at &quot;peaceable coercion.&quot; Webster wrote an anonymous pamphlet attacking it.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Eventually the trouble with England escalated into the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>. That same year, Daniel Webster gave an address to the Washington Benevolent Society, an oration that proved critical to his career. The speech decried the war and the violation of New England's shipping rights that preceded it, but it also strongly denounced the extremism of those more radical among the unhappy New Englanders who were beginning to call for the region's <a href="secession" class="uri" title="wikilink">secession</a> from the Union.</p>
<p>The Washington oration was widely circulated and read throughout New Hampshire, and it led to Webster's 1812 selection to the <a href="Rockingham_Convention" title="wikilink">Rockingham Convention</a>, an assembly that sought to formally declare the state's grievances with President <a href="James_Madison" title="wikilink">James Madison</a> and the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal government</a>. He was a member of the drafting committee and was chosen to compose the <em>Rockingham Memorial</em> to be sent to Madison. The report included much of the same tone and opinions held in the Washington Society address, except that, uncharacteristically for its chief architect, it alluded to the threat of secession saying, &quot;If a separation of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">states</a> shall ever take place, it will be, on some occasion, when one portion of the country undertakes to control, to regulate, and to sacrifice the interest of another.&quot;&lt;ref name=Discovering Biography, &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>Webster's efforts on behalf of New England Federalism, shipping interests, and war opposition resulted in his election to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a> in <a href="United_States_House_elections,_1812" title="wikilink">1812</a>, where he served two terms ending March 1817. He was an outspoken critic of the Madison administration and its wartime policies, denouncing its efforts at financing the war through paper money and opposing <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a> <a href="James_Monroe" title="wikilink">James Monroe</a>'s <a href="Conscription_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conscription</a> proposal. Notable in his second term was his support of the reestablishment of a stable specie-based <a href="History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">national bank</a>; but he opposed the <a href="tariff_of_1816" title="wikilink">tariff of 1816</a> (which sought to protect the nation's manufacturing interests) and <a href="Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House Speaker</a> Henry Clay's <a href="American_System_(economic_plan)" title="wikilink">American System</a>.</p>
<p>This opposition was in accordance with a number of his professed beliefs (and the majority of his constituents') including <a href="free_trade" title="wikilink">free trade</a>, that the tariff's &quot;great object was to raise revenue, not to foster manufacture,&quot; and that it was against &quot;the true spirit of the Constitution&quot; to give &quot;excessive bounties or encouragements to one [industry] over another.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <img src="Danielwebster.jpg" title="fig:Early daguereotype of Webster." alt="Early daguereotype of Webster." /> After his second term, Webster did not seek a third, choosing his law practice instead. In an attempt to secure greater financial success for himself and his family (he had married Grace Fletcher in 1808, with whom he had four children), he moved his practice from Portsmouth to Boston.</p>

<p>Webster pleads Dartmouth's case before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>]]</p>
<p>Webster was hailed as the leading constitutional scholar of his generation and probably had more influence on the powerful <a href="John_Marshall" title="wikilink">Marshall Court</a> than any other advocate. Of the 223 cases he argued before the Supreme Court, he won about half of them. But, even more, Webster played a crucial role in eight of the most celebrated constitutional cases decided by the Court between 1801 and 1824. In many of these&lt;U+2014&gt;particularly in Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) and Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)--the Supreme Court handed down decisions based largely on Webster's arguments. Marshall patterned some of his Court decisions after Webster's briefs, and Webster played a crucial role in helping many of the justices interpret matters of constitutional law. As a result many people began calling him the Great Expounder of the Constitution.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Webster had been highly regarded in New Hampshire since his days in Boscawen, and had been respected throughout the House during his service there. He came to national prominence, however, as counsel in a number of important <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> cases.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These cases remain major <a href="precedent" title="wikilink">precedents</a> in the <a href="United_States_constitutional_law" title="wikilink">Constitutional jurisprudence</a> of the United States.</p>
<p>In 1816, Webster was retained by the Federalist trustees of his alma mater, <a href="Dartmouth_College" title="wikilink">Dartmouth College</a>, to represent them in their case against the newly elected New Hampshire <a href="Democratic-Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic-Republican</a> <a href="New_Hampshire_General_Court" title="wikilink">state legislature</a>. The legislature had passed new laws converting Dartmouth into a state institution, by changing the size of the college's trustee body and adding a further board of overseers, which they put into the hands of the state senate.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> New Hampshire argued that they, as successor in sovereignty to <a href="George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George III</a>, who had chartered Dartmouth, had the right to revise the charter.</p>

<p>Webster argued <em><a href="Dartmouth_College_v._Woodward" title="wikilink">Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a></em> to the Supreme Court (with significant aid from <a href="Jeremiah_Mason" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Mason</a> and <a href="Jeremiah_Smith" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Smith</a>), invoking <a href="Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States" title="wikilink">Article I, section 10</a> of the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Constitution</a> (the <a href="Contract_Clause" title="wikilink">Contract Clause</a>) against the State. The <a href="John_Marshall" title="wikilink">Marshall court</a>, continuing with its history of limiting <a href="states&#39;_rights" title="wikilink">states' rights</a> and reaffirming the supremacy of the Constitutional protection of contract, ruled in favor of Webster and Dartmouth 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1. This decided that <a href="corporations_law" title="wikilink">corporations</a> did not, as many then held, have to justify their privileges by acting in the public interest, but were independent of the states.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

Ogden</a></em> (1824), cases similar to <em>Dartmouth</em> in the court's application of a broad interpretation of the Constitution and strengthening of the federal courts' power to constrain the states, which have since been used to justify wide powers for the federal government. Webster's handling of these cases made him one of the era's foremost constitutional lawyers, as well as one of the most highly paid.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Webster's growing prominence as a constitutional lawyer led to his election as a delegate to the 1820 <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> <a href="Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention</a>. There he spoke in opposition to <a href="universal_suffrage" title="wikilink">universal suffrage</a> (for men), on the Federalist grounds that power naturally follows <a href="property" class="uri" title="wikilink">property</a>, and the vote should be limited accordingly; but the <a href="Massachusetts_Constitution" title="wikilink">constitution</a> was amended against his advice.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He also supported the (existing) districting of the <a href="Massachusetts_Senate" title="wikilink">State Senate</a> so that each seat represented an equal amount of property.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Webster's performance at the convention furthered his reputation. <a href="Joseph_Story" title="wikilink">Joseph Story</a> (also a delegate at the convention) wrote to Jeremiah Mason following the convention saying &quot;Our friend Webster has gained a noble reputation. He was before known as a lawyer; but he has now secured the title of an eminent and enlightened statesman.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Webster also spoke at <a href="Plymouth_(town),_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> commemorating the <a href="Plymouth_Rock" title="wikilink">landing</a> of the <a href="Pilgrims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pilgrims</a> in 1620; his oration was widely circulated and read throughout New England. He was elected to the <a href="18th_United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Eighteenth Congress</a> in <a href="United_States_House_elections,_1822" title="wikilink">1822</a>, from Boston.</p>
<p>In his second term, Webster found Miles Bearden himself a leader of the fragmented House Federalists who had split following the failure of the secessionist-minded 1814 <a href="Hartford_Convention" title="wikilink">Hartford Convention</a> that he avoided. <a href="Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker</a> <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a> made Webster chairman of the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary" title="wikilink">Judiciary Committee</a> in an attempt to win his and the Federalists' support. His term of service in the House between 1822 and 1828 was marked by his legislative success at reforming the United States criminal code, and his failure at expanding the size of the Supreme Court. He largely supported the <a href="National_Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Republican</a> administration of <a href="John_Quincy_Adams" title="wikilink">John Quincy Adams</a>, including Adams' candidacy in the highly contested <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1824" title="wikilink">election of 1824</a> and the administration's defense of treaty-sanctioned <a href="Creek_people" title="wikilink">Creek Indian</a> land rights against <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>'s expansionist claims.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>While a Representative, Webster continued accepting speaking engagements in New England, most notably his oration on the fiftieth anniversary of <em><a href="Battle_of_Bunker_Hill" title="wikilink">Bunker Hill</a></em> (1825) and his eulogy on <em><a href="John_Adams" title="wikilink">Adams</a> and <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Jefferson</a></em> (1826). With the support of a coalition of both Federalists and Republicans, Webster's record in the House and his celebrity as an orator led to his June 1827 election to the Senate from Massachusetts. His first wife, Grace, died in January 1828, and he married Caroline LeRoy in December 1829.</p>

Healy" /> When Webster returned to the Senate from his wife's funeral in March 1828, he found the chamber considering a <a href="Tariff_of_Abominations" title="wikilink">new tariff bill</a> that sought to increase the <a href="duty_(economics)" title="wikilink">duties</a> on foreign manufactured goods on top of the increases of 1816 and 1824, both of which Webster had opposed. Now, however, Webster changed his position to support a protective tariff. Explaining the change, Webster stated that after the failure of the rest of the nation to heed New England's objections in 1816 and 1824, &quot;nothing was left to New England but to conform herself to the will of others,&quot; and now consequently being heavily invested in manufacturing, he would not now do them injury. It is the more blunt opinion of Justus D. Doenecke that Webster's support of the 1828 tariff was a result of &quot;his new closeness to the rising mill-owning families of the region, the <a href="Abbott_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Lawrences</a> and the <a href="Lowell_family" title="wikilink">Lowells</a>.&quot;&lt;ref name=Discovering Biography, &quot;Daniel Webster&quot;&gt;&quot;Daniel Webster.&quot; Discovering Biography. Online Edition. Gale, 2003. Student Resource Center. Thomson Gale. June 16, 2006</ref> Webster also gave greater approval to Clay's <a href="American_System_(economic_plan)" title="wikilink">American System</a>, a change that along with his modified view of the tariff brought him closer to Henry Clay.</p>
<p>The passage of the tariff brought increased sectional tensions to the U.S., tensions that were agitated by then <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> <a href="John_C._Calhoun" title="wikilink">John C. Calhoun</a>'s promulgation of his <a href="South_Carolina_Exposition_and_Protest" title="wikilink">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</a>. The exposition espoused the idea of <a href="Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)" title="wikilink">nullification</a>, a doctrine first articulated in the U.S. by <a href="James_Madison" title="wikilink">Madison</a> and <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Jefferson</a> that held that states were <a href="sovereignty" title="wikilink">sovereign</a> entities and held ultimate authority over the limits of the power of the federal government, and could thus &quot;nullify&quot; any act of the central government it deemed unconstitutional. While for a time the tensions increased by Calhoun's exposition lay beneath the surface, they burst forth when <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> Senator <a href="Robert_Young_Hayne" title="wikilink">Robert Young Hayne</a> opened the 1830 <a href="Webster-Hayne_debate" title="wikilink">Webster-Hayne debate</a>. <img src="Daguerreotype-Daniel-Webster.jpg" title="fig:An early daguerreotype of Daniel Webster" alt="An early daguerreotype of Daniel Webster" /> By 1830, Federal land policy had long been an issue.

According to Adams' <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="Richard_Rush" title="wikilink">Richard Rush</a>, this served to provide the federal government with an additional source of revenue, but also to discourage <a href="Territorial_acquisitions_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">westward migration</a> that tended to increase wages through the increased scarcity of labor.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Senator Hayne, in an effort to sway the west against the north and the tariff, seized upon a minor point in the land debate and accused the north of attempting to limit western expansion for their own benefit.

<p>The next day, Webster, feeling compelled to respond on New England's behalf, gave his first rebuttal to Hayne, highlighting what he saw as the virtues of the North's policies toward the west and claiming that restrictions on western expansion and growth were primarily the responsibility of <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">southerners</a>. Hayne in turn responded the following day, denouncing Webster's inconsistencies with regards to the American system and personally attacking Webster for his role in the so called &quot;<a href="corrupt_bargain" title="wikilink">corrupt bargain</a>&quot; of 1824. The course of the debate strayed even further away from the initial matter of land sales with Hayne openly defending the &quot;Carolina Doctrine&quot; of nullification as being the doctrine of Jefferson and Madison.</p>

<p>On January 27, Webster gave his <em>Second Reply to Hayne</em>, in which Webster openly attacked Nullification, negatively contrasted South Carolina's response to the tariff with that of his native New England's response to the Embargo of 1807, rebutted Hayne's personal attacks against him, and famously concluded in defiance of nullification (which was later embodied in John C. Calhoun's declaration of <em>&quot;The Union; second to our liberty most dear!&quot;</em>), <em>&quot;Liberty and Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable!&quot;</em></p>
<p><img src="Black_Dan.jpg" title="fig:The so-called &quot;Black Dan&quot; portrait" alt="The so-called &quot;Black Dan&quot; portrait" /> While the debate's philosophical presentation of nullification and Webster's abstract fears of rebellion were brought into reality in 1832 when Calhoun's native South Carolina passed its <a href="Ordinance_of_Nullification" title="wikilink">Ordinance of Nullification</a>, Webster supported President <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a>'s sending of U.S. troops to the borders of South Carolina and the <a href="Force_Bill" title="wikilink">Force Bill</a>, not Henry Clay's 1833 compromise that eventually defused the crisis. Webster thought Clay's concessions were dangerous and would only further embolden the south and legitimize its tactics. Especially unsettling was the resolution affirming that &quot;the people of the several States composing these United States are united as parties to a constitutional compact, to which the people of each State <em>acceded</em> as a separate sovereign community.&quot; The usage of the word <em>accede</em> would, in his opinion, lead to the logical end of those states' right to secede.</p>
<p>At the same time however, Webster, like Clay, opposed the economic policies of Andrew Jackson, the most famous of those being Jackson's campaign against the <a href="Second_Bank_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Second Bank of the United States</a> (1816&lt;U+2013&gt;1841) in 1832, an institution that held Webster on retainer as legal counsel and of whose Boston Branch he was the director. Clay, Webster, and a number of other former Federalists and National Republicans united as the <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig Party</a>, in defense of the Bank against Jackson's intention to replace it. There was an economic <a href="Panic_of_1837" title="wikilink">panic in 1837</a>, which converted Webster's heavy speculation in <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">midwestern</a> property into a personal debt from which Webster never recovered. His debt was exacerbated by his propensity for living &quot;habitually beyond his means&quot;, lavishly furnishing his estate and giving away money with &quot;reckless generosity and heedless profusion&quot;, in addition to indulging the smaller-scale &quot;passions and appetites&quot; of gambling and alcohol.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1836" title="wikilink">1836</a>, Webster was one of three Whig Party candidates to run for the office of <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a>, but he only managed to gain the support of Massachusetts. This was the first of three unsuccessful attempts at gaining the presidency. In <a href="1839_Whig_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1839</a>, the Whig Party nominated <a href="William_Henry_Harrison" title="wikilink">William Henry Harrison</a> for president.

<p>Following his victory in 1840, President Harrison appointed Webster to the post of <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> in 1841, a post he retained under President <a href="John_Tyler" title="wikilink">John Tyler</a> after the death of Harrison a month after his inauguration. In September 1841, an internal division amongst the Whigs over the question of the National Bank caused all the Whigs (except Webster who was in Europe at the time) to resign from Tyler's <a href="United_States_Cabinet" title="wikilink">cabinet</a>. In 1842, he was the architect of the <a href="Webster-Ashburton_Treaty" title="wikilink">Webster-Ashburton Treaty</a>, which resolved the <a href="Caroline_Affair" title="wikilink">Caroline Affair</a>, established the definitive <a href="Canada&lt;U+2013&gt;United_States_border" title="wikilink">Eastern border</a> between the United States and Canada (<a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> and <a href="New_Brunswick" title="wikilink">New Brunswick</a>), and signaled a definite and lasting peace between the United States and Britain.

<p>Webster was bitterly attacked by <a href="abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolitionists</a> in New England who felt betrayed by his compromises.

<p>Resigning the Senate under a cloud in 1850, he resumed his former position as Secretary of State in the cabinet of Whig President <a href="Millard_Fillmore" title="wikilink">Millard Fillmore</a>.</p>
<p>Notable in this second tenure was the increasingly strained relationship between the United States and the <a href="Austrian_Empire" title="wikilink">Austrian Empire</a> in the aftermath of what was seen by Austria as American interference in its rebellious <a href="Kingdom_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hungary</a> (see <a href="Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848" title="wikilink">Hungarian Revolution of 1848</a>). This was especially manifest in very warm welcome extended to the exiled Hungarian leader <a href="Lajos_Kossuth" title="wikilink">Lajos Kossuth</a> in the US: his ship was greeted with a hundred-gun salute when it passed <a href="Jersey_City" title="wikilink">Jersey City</a> and hundreds of thousands of people came to see him set foot in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>; heralded as the Hungarian <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, he was given a <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">congressional</a> Banquet and received at the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> and the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>. Webster himself wanted Kossuth's help in the upcoming presidential election, and spoke of &quot;seeing the American Republican model develop in Hungary&quot;, although President Fillmore apologised to the Austrian <a href="charg&lt;U+00E9&gt;_d&#39;affaires" title="wikilink">charg&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'affaires</a> for what he explained was an individual unofficial opinion. However, as chief American diplomat, Webster did author the H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsemann Letter, in which he defended what he believed to be America's right to take an active interest in the internal politics of Hungary, while still maintaining its neutrality.</p>
<p>Webster also advocated the establishment of commercial relations with <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, going so far as to draft the letter that was to be presented to the <a href="Emperor_K&lt;U+014D&gt;mei" title="wikilink">Emperor K&lt;U+014D&gt;mei</a> on President Fillmore's behalf by Commodore <a href="Matthew_Calbraith_Perry" title="wikilink">Matthew Perry</a> on his 1852 voyage to Asia.</p>
<p>As Secretary of State Webster continued to strongly uphold the Compromise of 1850 and specifically the Fugitive Slave Law. In early 1851, when the <a href="abolitionism" title="wikilink">anti-slavery</a> <a href="Liberty_Party_(1840s)" title="wikilink">Liberty Party</a> was due to hold its state convention at <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse, New York</a>, Webster sternly warned that the law would be enforced even &quot;here in Syracuse in the midst of the next Anti-Slavery Convention.&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Actually, during the conference William Henry, an escaped slave from <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a> and a resident of Syracuse, was duly arrested and was about to be sent back to his master, to which the abolitionists reacted by storming the jail and setting the fugitive slave free (see <a href="Jerry_Rescue" title="wikilink">Jerry Rescue</a>), motivated in part by the desire to defy Webster.</p>
<p>In <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1852" title="wikilink">1852</a> he made his final campaign for the Presidency, again for the Whig nomination. Before and during the campaign a number of critics asserted that his support of the compromise was only an attempt to win southern support for his candidacy, &quot;profound selfishness,&quot; in the words of <a href="Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" title="wikilink">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>. Though the <em>Seventh of March</em> speech was indeed warmly received throughout the south, the speech made him too <a href="polarization_(politics)" title="wikilink">polarizing</a> a figure to receive the nomination and Webster was again defeated by a military hero, this time General <a href="Winfield_Scott" title="wikilink">Winfield Scott</a>.</p>
<p>He died on October 24, 1852 at his home in <a href="Marshfield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Marshfield, Massachusetts</a>, after falling from his horse and suffering a crushing blow to the head, complicated by <a href="cirrhosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cirrhosis</a> of the liver, which resulted in a <a href="cerebral_hemorrhage" title="wikilink">cerebral hemorrhage</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Whether people hated Webster or admired him&lt;U+2014&gt;there was little middle ground&lt;U+2014&gt;it is hard to deny the majesty of his oratory, the immensity of his intellectual powers, and the primacy of his constitutional knowledge. He was the heroic champion of nationalism and modernization.</p>
<p>Although Webster's diplomatic record was historic, his 29 years in Congress produced not one significant piece of legislation. <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a> and <a href="Stephen_Douglas" title="wikilink">Stephen Douglas</a> were the leaders in legislation, and he never tried to rival them. There is also evidence that Webster took bribes while in public office and sold diplomatic appointments for private gain, both taboos even by 19th standards of probity.</p>
<p>Webster indulged his extravagant tastes (he spent enormous sums on wine, boats, and improvements to his Marshfield estate). A poor money manager, he relied on wealthy friends for indefinite &quot;loans&quot; to sustain his spendthrift lifestyle, a phenomenon that led his enemies to call him &quot;Black Dan.&quot; Historians have not found any positions that he adjusted to curry favor with his rich friends, who saw it their duty to see what they considered the greatest man of the era be able to stay in office&lt;U+2014&gt;they called him &quot;Godlike Dan.&quot; &quot;Black Dan&quot; had several mistresses, and drank excessively, but did not dramatically differ from other Senators in these regards.</p>
<p>Webster's &quot;Reply to Hayne&quot; in 1830 was generally regarded as &quot;the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress,&quot; and was a stock exercise for oratory students for 75 years.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" title="wikilink">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, who had criticized Webster following the Seventh of March address, remarked in the immediate aftermath of his death that Webster was &quot;the completest man&quot;, and that &quot;nature had not in our days or not since <a href="Napoleon_I_of_France" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>, cut out such a masterpiece.&quot; Others like <a href="Henry_Cabot_Lodge" title="wikilink">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> and <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a> noted Webster's vices, especially the perpetual debt against which he, as Lodge reports, employed &quot;checks or notes for several thousand dollars in token of admiration&quot; from his friends. &quot;This was, of course, utterly wrong and demoralizing, but Mr. Webster came, after a time, to look upon such transactions as natural and proper. [...] He seems to have regarded the merchants and bankers of <a href="State_Street_Corp." title="wikilink">State Street</a> very much as a feudal baron regarded his peasantry. It was their privilege and duty to support him, and he repaid them with an occasional magnificent compliment.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Several historians suggest Webster failed to exercise leadership for any political issue or vision. Lodge describes (with the Rockingham Convention in mind) Webster's &quot;susceptibility to outside influences which formed such an odd trait in the character of a man so imperious by nature. When acting alone, he spoke his own opinions. When in a situation where public opinion was concentrated against him, he submitted to modifications of his views with a curious and indolent indifference.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Similarly, <a href="Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr." title="wikilink">Arthur Schlesinger</a> cites Webster's letter requesting retainers for fighting for the Bank, one of his most inveterate causes; he then asks how the American people could &quot;follow [Webster] through hell or high water when he would not lead unless someone made up a purse for him?&quot;</p>
<p>He served the interest of the wealthy Boston merchants who elected and supported him, first for free trade, and later, when they had started manufacturing, for protection; both for the Union and for a compromise with the South in 1850. Schlesinger remarks that the real miracle of <em><a href="The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster" title="wikilink">The Devil and Daniel Webster</a></em> is not a soul sold to the devil, or the jury of ghostly traitors, but Webster speaking against the &quot;sanctity of the contract&quot;.</p>

<p>Webster has garnered respect and admiration for his Seventh of March speech in defense of the 1850 compromise measures that helped to delay the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>. In <em><a href="Profiles_in_Courage" title="wikilink">Profiles in Courage</a></em>, Kennedy called Webster's defense of the compromise, despite the risk to his presidential ambitions and the denunciations he faced from the north, one of the &quot;greatest acts of courageous principle&quot; in the history of the Senate. Conversely, <em>Seventh of March</em> has been criticized by Lodge who contrasted the speech's support of the 1850 compromise with his 1833 rejection of similar measures. &quot;While he was brave and true and wise in 1833,&quot; said Lodge, &quot;in 1850 he was not only inconsistent, but that he erred deeply in policy and statesmanship&quot; in his advocacy of a policy that &quot;made war inevitable by encouraging slave-holders to believe that they could always obtain anything they wanted by a sufficient show of violence.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>More widely agreed upon, notably by both Senator Lodge and President Kennedy, is Webster's skill as an orator, with Kennedy praising Webster's &quot;ability to make alive and supreme the latent sense of oneness, of union, that all Americans felt but few could express.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Schlesinger, however, notes that he is also an example of the limitations of formal oratory: Congress heard Webster or Clay with admiration, but they rarely prevailed at the vote.
