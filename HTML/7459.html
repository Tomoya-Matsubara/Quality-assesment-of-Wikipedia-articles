She died at a congress in <a href="G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppingen</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>.</p>
<p>Dorothee S&lt;U+00F6&gt;lle studied theology, philosophy and literature at the <a href="University_of_Cologne" title="wikilink">University of Cologne</a>, earning a doctorate with a thesis on the connections between theology and poetry. She taught briefly in <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a> before returning to <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a> as a university lecturer. She became active in politics, speaking out against the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>, the <a href="arms_race" title="wikilink">arms race</a> of the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a> and injustices in the <a href="developing_world" title="wikilink">developing world</a>. Notably, from 1968 to 1972 she organized Cologne's <a href="Politisches_Nachtgebet" title="wikilink">Politisches Nachtgebet</a> (political night-prayers). Between 1975 and 1987, she spent six months a year at <a href="Union_Theological_Seminary" title="wikilink">Union Theological Seminary</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, where she was a professor of systematic theology. Although she never held a professorship in <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, she received an honorary professorship from the <a href="University_of_Hamburg" title="wikilink">University of Hamburg</a> in 1994.</p>
<p>She wrote a large number of books, including <em>The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance</em> (2001) and her autobiography <em>Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian</em> (1999). Perhaps her best-known work in English was &quot;Suffering,&quot; which offers a critique of &quot;Christian masochism&quot; and &quot;theological sadism.&quot; Solle's critique is against the assumption that God is all-powerful and the cause of suffering; humans thus suffer for some greater purpose. Instead, God suffers and is powerless alongside us. Humans are to struggle together against oppression, sexism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of authoritarianism.</p>

First, in 1954 she married the artist <a href="Dietrich_S&lt;U+00F6&gt;lle" title="wikilink">Dietrich S&lt;U+00F6&gt;lle</a>, whom she divorced in 1964.
