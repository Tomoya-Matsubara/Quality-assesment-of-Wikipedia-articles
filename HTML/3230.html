<p><a href="Lindsay_Hassett" title="wikilink">Lindsay Hassett</a> was the vice-captain and one of three on-tour selectors<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for <a href="Don_Bradman" title="wikilink">Don Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948" title="wikilink">Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948</a>. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet <em>The Invincibles</em>, and resulted in them being regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time. A right-handed batsman, Hassett played in all five Tests; he was a <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">middle-order batsman</a> in all but the Fourth Test, when he stood in as an opener due to an injury to <a href="Sid_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sid Barnes</a>.</p>
<p>As the matches were often played consecutively without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, and as a result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on <a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">damp pitches</a> before the First Test. Against <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after <a href="Sam_Loxton" title="wikilink">Sam Loxton</a> succumbed to injury. In a later match against <a href="Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.</p>
<p>Hassett ended the first-class matches with 1,563 runs at a <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> of 74.22 including seven centuries. Among the Australians, he had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and <a href="Arthur_Morris" title="wikilink">Arthur Morris</a> and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the <a href="History_of_English_amateur_cricket#Amateurism_in_cricket" title="wikilink">Gentlemen of England</a>. Hassett was less successful in the Tests, scoring 310 runs at 44.28 with one <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a>. This placed him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. His biggest contribution was his 137 in the first innings of the First Test at <a href="Trent_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trent Bridge</a>. It was a patient innings as England attempted to stop Australia's scoring with defensive <a href="leg_theory" title="wikilink">leg theory</a>; Hassett helped the tourists set up a first innings lead of 344, which laid the foundation for the eventual victory. He had three scores between 35 and 50 during the Tests, but was unable to convert his starts into large innings. Hassett took 23 catches on the tour, the most by an Australia excluding <a href="wicket-keeper" title="wikilink">wicket-keepers</a>.</p>
<p>Hassett was named as one of the five <a href="Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1949. <em><a href="Wisden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wisden</a></em> remarked that &quot;in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-tour">Early tour</h2>
<p>The 1948 tour was Hassett's second Test campaign in England. A diminutive right-handed batsman, he toured England under Bradman in 1938, making his Test debut during the series and playing in all four matches. Following the interruption of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Hassett led the <a href="Australian_Services_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australian Services</a>—a military team—in the <a href="Victory_Tests" title="wikilink">Victory Tests</a>. He became a regular member of the Test team and was the vice-captain under Bradman for the series against <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a href="Indian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> in Australia during 1946–47 and 1947–48 respectively. In the latter Test series, he averaged 110.66 with the bat, and he was duly selected for the tour of England, continuing in his role as Bradman's deputy.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia&lt;U+2019&gt;s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia <a href="declaration_and_forfeiture" title="wikilink">declared</a> at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hassett was rested for next match against <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a>, which resulted in another innings win for the tourists.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The Australians then proceeded to play <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> at <a href="Bradford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bradford</a>, on a <a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">damp pitch</a> that suited slower bowling; rain delayed the start of the match until midway through the first afternoon.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Bradman rested himself and returned to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> while Hassett led the team. Yorkshire elected to bat and were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, despite Australia losing <a href="all_rounder" title="wikilink">all rounder</a> <a href="Sam_Loxton" title="wikilink">Sam Loxton</a> with a hamstring injury. Australia replied with 101 without Loxton, who was unable to bat. Hassett came in at 1/24 and was immediately out for a <a href="duck_(cricket)" title="wikilink">duck</a>. Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89. Chasing 60 for victory,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be <a href="road_roller" title="wikilink">rolled</a>. Former Australian Test batsman <a href="Jack_Fingleton" title="wikilink">Jack Fingleton</a> said that Hassett &quot;might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [erratic bounce and sideways movement] out of the pitch&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a> was then out at 3/13 after attempting to hit a <a href="six_(cricket)" title="wikilink">six</a>, while Hassett was nervous after his first innings duck. <a href="Ron_Hamence" title="wikilink">Ron Hamence</a> joined Hassett and they took the score to 20 before the former was <a href="run_out" title="wikilink">run out</a> attempting a quick single. Without further addition to the score, Hassett attempted a <a href="Batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots" title="wikilink">pull shot</a> and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball. The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett, leaving Australia at 5/20.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> To make matters worse, Loxton was still too injured to bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="Neil_Harvey" title="wikilink">Neil Harvey</a> had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">short leg</a>. <a href="Colin_McCool" title="wikilink">Colin McCool</a> fell at 6/31, and Harvey and new partner <a href="Don_Tallon" title="wikilink">Don Tallon</a> were both given lives before the tourists scraped home by four wickets.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

Hassett came in and Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3/403. Hassett struck form and reached his first <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a> for the English summer, posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test seamer <a href="Alec_Bedser" title="wikilink">Alec Bedser</a> as Australia were bowled out for 632.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Bradman&lt;U+2019&gt;s men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Bradman rested himself for the next match against <a href="Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and Hassett led the tourists to another innings victory after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat. After Cambridge had made 167, Hassett scored an <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">unbeaten</a> 61 in a <a href="partnership_(cricket)" title="wikilink">partnership</a> of 140 with <a href="Bill_Brown_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Brown</a> before <a href="declaration_and_forfeiture" title="wikilink">declaring</a> at 4/414 when Brown fell for 200.

<p>The next match was against the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and were basically a full-strength Test team, while Australia selected their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3 with Hassett in his customary position at No. 4. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests.

Attempting to break Young's restrictive <a href="leg_side" title="wikilink">leg side</a> bowling, Hassett attempted to loft him over <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">cover</a>, but mishit the ball and was caught by <a href="Cyril_Washbrook" title="wikilink">Cyril Washbrook</a>.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>In England's second innings, Lindwall <a href="bouncer_(cricket)" title="wikilink">bounced</a> Washbrook and the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew in the air straight towards <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">fine leg</a>, where Hassett dropped the ball on the third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">long leg</a> and was again dropped by Hassett.

<p>With Barnes injured, Hassett moved from the middle-order to open the innings with Morris.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1/13, bringing Bradman to the crease.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Hassett batted in a restrained manner, while Bradman attacked.

<p>England declared at 8/365 after two overs on the last day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a <a href="road_roller" title="wikilink">heavy roller</a>, which would help to break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Yardely&lt;U+2019&gt;s declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team.

<p>Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Hassett was rested as Australia defeated <a href="Kent_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Kent</a> by an innings.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In the next match against the <a href="History_of_English_amateur_cricket#Amateurism_in_cricket" title="wikilink">Gentlemen of England</a> at Lord's, Hassett came to the crease at 2/221 after Brown was out for 121 and featured in a 110-run third-wicket partnership with Bradman, who then fell for 150. Miller came in and put on 157 with Hassett before being dismissed for 69 on the second day. Australia eventually declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players. Australia went on to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Bradman then rested himself and Hassett led Australia against <a href="Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>. Hassett decided to bat and came to the crease when Brown was <a href="run_out" title="wikilink">run out</a> before Australia had scored a single run. He made 103 and was the next batsman to fall at 2/256, after a second-wicket partnership with Barnes, who <a href="List_of_cricket_terms#R" title="wikilink">retired ill</a> on 42, and Harvey, who went on to make 126. Australia declared on 5/560 at the end of the first day. Hassett enforced the follow on as Australia went on to win by an innings and 374 runs, skittling the hosts for 115 and 71.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Hassett made it three centuries in a row against the <a href="South_of_England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South of England</a>. He came in at 2/49 to join Bradman and the pair added 188 for the third wicket before the captain fell for 143 with the total at 3/237. Hassett then put on 175 with Harvey before the latter was out for 110 at 4/412. He was eventually out for the top score of 151, with the score at 6/446, having anchored the tourists&lt;U+2019&gt; innings. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match. Hassett bowled six wicketless overs and conceded 28 runs in South's only innings.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
<p>Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the <a href="H._D._G._Leveson-Gower" title="wikilink">H. D. G. Leveson-Gower</a>'s XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of <a href="Ian_Johnson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Ian Johnson</a> at the expense of <a href="Doug_Ring" title="wikilink">Doug Ring</a>. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists&lt;U+2019&gt; last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a><a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a><a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>.

<p>Aside from being the vice-captain, Hassett was one of three on-tour selectors along with Bradman and Morris.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> As matches often started the day after the previous fixture, Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a><a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a><a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a><a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a><a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a><a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a><a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a><a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a><a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a><a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Hassett had two close encounters as captain, both on damp pitches before the First Test.

After the Tests, Australia compiled 5/560 against Somerset and won by an innings and 374 runs in less than two days.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a><a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> The matches against Durham and Glamorgan were washed out, with at least half the playing time lost.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a><a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>A right-handed batsman, Hassett played in all five Tests; he batted in the middle-order in all but the Fourth Test at Headingley, when he opened due to an injury to <a href="Sid_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sid Barnes</a>. Aside from the Headingley Test, Hassett batted at No. 4 after Morris, Barnes and Bradman and in front of <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a>, except in the first innings of the series when he batted at No. 6 and made 137. Hassett scored 310 runs at 44.28, placing him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. He took six catches and did not bowl during the Tests.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a><a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a><a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a><a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a><a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a><a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a><a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
<p>Hassett ended the first-class tour with 1,563 runs at 74.22 with seven first-class centuries. He had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Morris and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a><a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> In his 27 first-class innings, Hassett batted at Nos. 3, 4 and 5, 21 times. Aside from the three instances in which he batted outside these positions in the Tests, Hassett made 139 while opening in the second match against Surrey in place of the injured <a href="Bill_Brown_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Brown</a>, and 35 and seven not out against Worcestershire and Leveson-Gower's XI, batting at No. 7 and No. 10 respectively.<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup> An occasional <a href="seam_bowling" title="wikilink">medium pacer</a>, Hassett delivered 12 overs—none in Tests—without taking a wicket.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a><a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> He took 23 catches, the most by an Australian (excluding <a href="wicket-keeper" title="wikilink">wicket-keepers</a>).<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a><a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a></p>
