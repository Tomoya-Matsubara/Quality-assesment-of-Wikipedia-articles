<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The railways would not build across the western frontier without settlement as it would be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The <a href="Clifford_Sifton" title="wikilink">Clifford Sifton</a> immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the <a href="Manitoba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manitoba</a> and <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> borders into the North West Territories which later became Saskatchewan. Immigration settlement to the last best west and the early highways began in the south east. The Federal Government survey crew reached this south eastern area of the District of Assiniboia, North West Territories in 1880. In 1881, the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $10.00 an acre.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> President Lincoln's U.S. Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken. In 1872, Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act attracting homesteaders to the West.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Saskatchewan <strong>Provincial Highway 39</strong> paralleled the headwaters of the <a href="Souris_River" title="wikilink">Souris River</a> as well as the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)</a> along the south eastern portion of its route. The highway traverses a course on a diagonal from south east to north west. The road followed the early surveyed road allowances made by the <em>Provincial Highway 39</em>, the precursor of the Saskatchewan Highway 39 followed the surveyed grade of the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">CPR</a> or <em>Soo Line</em> between the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> border and east of <a href="Moose_Jaw,_Saskatchewan" title="wikilink">Moose Jaw</a>. Travel along Provincial Highway 39 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the <em>square</em> following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and rail lines. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first <a href="Roads_in_Saskatchewan" title="wikilink">highway</a> was designed on 90 degree right angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>With the establishment of settlements and population came the attendant need for education, health, fire and police protection and an urgent need to improve methods of travel. The <a href="Territorial_evolution_of_Canada" title="wikilink">North West Territories</a> established Departments which did not last long, and were soon replaced by a rural administrative system called Local Improvement Districts (LID). Local Improvement Districts were very large, and with the early dirt trails for roads, and a limited number of automobiles, the area was found much to large to administer. The L.I.D. soon gave way to the <a href="rural_municipality" title="wikilink">rural municipality</a> system of rural civic administration and encompassed on average 9 townships, 3 x 3 in area, which were each  square, and with some modifications is still the rural administration in use today. A <a href="rural_municipality" title="wikilink">rural municipality (R.M.)</a> was an elected governing system providing essential services such as police, fire, health, education and infrastructure services for rural residents. For example L.I.D. 64 was the precursor of <a href="Brock_No._64,_Saskatchewan" title="wikilink">Brock No. 64</a> in the <a href="Districts_of_the_Northwest_Territories" title="wikilink">district</a> of <a href="Assiniboia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assiniboia</a>, <a href="Territorial_evolution_of_Canada" title="wikilink">North West Territories</a>. Historically, community residents could pay taxes or supply a couple days per quarter section labour constructing roads, bridges, and fireguards instead of paying taxes. This civic government with its elected officials attended to the maintenance and construction of the early pioneer road. Two horse then eight horse scrapers maintained these early dirt roads.</p>
<p>&quot;The final meeting of the joint L. I. D.'s was held on November 5, 1910. By now taxes were up to $8.00 per quarter section. During the last few years of the L.I.D. Government a few changes began to take place. The road work day was reduced from ten to eight hours. The first grader was bought on March 31, 1906. Further road machinery was purchased, drag scrapers at $7,25 each and wheel scrapers at $51.00 each. Road overseers were also weed inspectors. In 1908, each Township received $100.00 for road work. Farmers were paid $30.00 an acre for land used for road building.... Road appropriations for 1927 were $2,500.00 for each Division with a tax rate of 6 mills... In 1928, the R. M.[Rural Municipality of Estevan No. 5] purchased a Holt 60 Caterpillar tractor and a 12-foot grader for $9,200.00. Road building now cost $103.00 a mile. The next year an elevating grader was purchased for $2,425.00. In 1930... Construction began on Highway 39.&quot;-A Tale That is Told: Estevan 1890 - 1980.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
