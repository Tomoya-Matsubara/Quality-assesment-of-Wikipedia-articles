<p>After finishing his education at <a href="Wellington_College" title="wikilink">Wellington College</a>, Walls worked for the Union Steamship Company.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He spent 17 years (1943 to 1960) employed by the shipping company, including 12 years at sea as a purser on ships trading mainly between New Zealand and Canada,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and as shipping representative in Tonga and the Cook Islands.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was during this time that he began painting as a hobby.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Walls arrived in London in 1960, and subsequently studied at the <a href="Chelsea_School_of_Art" title="wikilink">Chelsea School of Art</a> (1960&lt;U+2013&gt;1963).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> His first solo exhibition was in 1964 at the Drian Galleries in London.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He painted full-time for many years, along with some lecturing and teaching.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
