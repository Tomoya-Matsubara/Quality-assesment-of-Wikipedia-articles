<p>William Playfair invented four types of <a href="Information_graphics" title="wikilink">diagrams</a>: in 1786 the <a href="line_chart" title="wikilink">line graph</a> and <a href="bar_chart" title="wikilink">bar chart</a> of economic data, and in 1801 the <a href="pie_chart" title="wikilink">pie chart</a> and circle graph, used to show part-whole relations.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Playfair was born in 1759 in Scotland during <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">the Enlightenment</a>, a Golden Age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. He was the fourth son of the <a href="reverend" class="uri" title="wikilink">reverend</a> James Playfair of the parish of Liff &amp; Benvie near the city of <a href="Dundee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dundee</a> in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>; his notable brothers were architect <a href="James_Playfair" title="wikilink">James Playfair</a> and mathematician <a href="John_Playfair" title="wikilink">John Playfair</a>. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his <a href="apprenticeship" class="uri" title="wikilink">apprenticeship</a> with <a href="Andrew_Meikle" title="wikilink">Andrew Meikle</a>, the inventor of the threshing machine, he became draftsman and personal assistant to <a href="James_Watt" title="wikilink">James Watt</a> in 1777 at 18.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Playfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to Paris, taking part in the <a href="storming_of_the_Bastille" title="wikilink">storming of the Bastille</a> two years later. He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a &quot;security bank&quot;, which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Ian Spence and <a href="Howard_Wainer" title="wikilink">Howard Wainer</a> in 2001 describe Playfair as &quot;engineer, political economist and scoundrel&quot; while &quot;Eminent Scotsmen&quot; calls him an &quot;ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer.&quot; It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother <a href="John_Playfair" title="wikilink">John Playfair</a>, the distinguished Edinburgh professor, and draws a moral about the importance of &quot;steadiness and consistency of plan&quot; as well as of &quot;genius.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bar-chart">Bar chart</h3>
<p>Two decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 <a href="Joseph_Priestley" title="wikilink">Joseph Priestley</a> had created the innovation of the first <a href="timeline" class="uri" title="wikilink">timeline</a> charts, in which individual bars were used to visualize the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) &quot;Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>These timelines directly inspired Wiliam Playfair's invention of the <a href="bar_chart" title="wikilink">bar chart</a>, which first appeared in his <em>Commercial and Political Atlas</em>, published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) &quot;Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as <a href="line_graph" title="wikilink">line graphs</a> or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. &quot;This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates statistical breviary (1801), showing the proportions of the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Turkish Empire</a> located in <a href="Asia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asia</a>, <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> before 1789]] Playfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the <a href="line_chart" title="wikilink">line</a>, <a href="bar_chart" title="wikilink">bar</a>, and <a href="pie_chart" title="wikilink">pie charts</a>. His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity.</p>
<p>Playfair first published <em>The Commercial and Political Atlas</em> in London in 1786. It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work. It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs.</p>
<p>Playfair's <em><a href="Statistical_Breviary" title="wikilink">Statistical Breviary</a>,</em> published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first <a href="pie_chart" title="wikilink">pie chart</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
