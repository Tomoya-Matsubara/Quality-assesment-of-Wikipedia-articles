<p>The <strong>Jordan River</strong> in the U.S. state of <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a> is a river about  long. Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at <a href="Utah_Lake" title="wikilink">Utah Lake</a>, it flows northward through the <a href="Salt_Lake_Valley" title="wikilink">Salt Lake Valley</a> and empties into the <a href="Great_Salt_Lake" title="wikilink">Great Salt Lake</a>. Four of Utah's five largest cities—<a href="Salt_Lake_City" title="wikilink">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="West_Valley_City,_Utah" title="wikilink">West Valley City</a>, <a href="West_Jordan,_Utah" title="wikilink">West Jordan</a> and <a href="Sandy,_Utah" title="wikilink">Sandy</a>—border the river. More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin, which is the part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Davis counties. During the <a href="Pleistocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pleistocene</a>, the area was part of <a href="Lake_Bonneville" title="wikilink">Lake Bonneville</a>.</p>
<p>Members of the <a href="Archaic_period_in_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Desert Archaic Culture</a> were the earliest known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years. <a href="Mormon_pioneers" title="wikilink">Mormon pioneers</a> led by <a href="Brigham_Young" title="wikilink">Brigham Young</a> were the first <a href="European_American" title="wikilink">European American</a> settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.</p>
<p>Although the Jordan was originally a cold-water <a href="fishery" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishery</a> with 13 native species including <a href="Bonneville_cutthroat_trout" title="wikilink">Bonneville cutthroat trout</a>, it has become a warm-water fishery where <a href="common_carp" title="wikilink">common carp</a> is most abundant. Heavily polluted for many years by raw sewage, agricultural runoff, and mining wastes, the river became cleaner in the 1960s when modern sewage treatment removed many pollutants. In the 21st century, pollution is further limited by the <a href="Clean_Water_Act" title="wikilink">Clean Water Act</a>, and, in some cases, the <a href="Superfund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superfund</a> program. Once the home of <a href="bighorn_sheep" title="wikilink">bighorn sheep</a> and <a href="beaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaver</a>, the contemporary river is frequented by <a href="raccoon" title="wikilink">raccoons</a>, <a href="red_fox" title="wikilink">red foxes</a>, and domestic pets. Along with the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake, it is still an important avian resource visited by more than 200 bird species.</p>

<p>The Jordan River is the <a href="Utah_Lake" title="wikilink">Utah Lake</a>'s only outflow, and originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities of <a href="Lehi,_Utah" title="wikilink">Lehi</a> and <a href="Saratoga_Springs,_Utah" title="wikilink">Saratoga Springs</a>. It then meanders north through the <a href="Utah_Valley" title="wikilink">Utah Valley</a> for approximately  until it passes through a gorge in the <a href="Traverse_Mountains" title="wikilink">Traverse Mountains</a>, known as the Jordan Narrows. The <a href="Utah_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Utah National Guard</a> base at <a href="Camp_W._G._Williams" title="wikilink">Camp Williams</a> lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Turner Dam, located  from the river's mouth (or at <a href="river_mile" title="wikilink">river mile</a> 41.8) and within the boundaries of the Jordan Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River. The Turner dam diverts water to the right or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal. Two pumping stations, situated next to the Turner Dam, divert water to the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal, Utah Lake Distribution Canal and Jacob-Welby Canal. The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County, Jacob-Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south eventually leading back into Utah Lake.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Outside the narrows, the river reaches the second dam, known as the Joint Dam, which is  from the river's mouth.

<p>From approximately 75,000 to 8,000 years ago, much of what is now northern Utah was covered by a Pleistocene lake called <a href="Lake_Bonneville" title="wikilink">Lake Bonneville</a>. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville reached an elevation of  above sea level and had a surface area of . The lake left behind <a href="lacustrine_plain" title="wikilink">lacustrine sediments</a>, which resulted in a relatively flat lake bed, and the valley floors seen today. As the region experienced increasingly warmer and drier climate over time, Lake Bonneville's water levels receded, leaving the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake as remnants.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The river's greatest slope, , is in the Jordan Narrows, while the rest of the river has a more gentle slope of .<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>By the late 1860s, it became apparent that new, larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed. The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880, sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake. After several years of dispute, a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The commission's 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were to rise above the established compromise level, the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates.

<h2 id="pollution">Pollution</h2>
<p>The Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly <a href="Arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater" title="wikilink">arsenic</a> and <a href="lead" class="uri" title="wikilink">lead</a>. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a total <a href="coliform" class="uri" title="wikilink">coliform</a> level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters. In 1965, a new sewage treatment plant came on-line in Salt Lake City that prevented  of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Utah_Division_of_Water_Quality" title="wikilink">Utah Division of Water Quality</a> and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah. Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the <a href="Clean_Water_Act" title="wikilink">Clean Water Act</a>. The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a <a href="total_maximum_daily_load" title="wikilink">total maximum daily load</a> (TMDL) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature, <a href="Dissolved_oxygen#Environmental_sciences" title="wikilink">dissolved oxygen</a>, <a href="total_dissolved_solids" title="wikilink">total dissolved solids</a>, <em><a href="Escherichia_coli" title="wikilink">E.

<h3 id="epa-superfund-sites">EPA Superfund sites</h3>
<p><a href="List_of_Superfund_sites_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Superfund sites</a> are designated as being among the nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and <a href="hazardous_waste" title="wikilink">hazardous waste</a>. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares a course of action to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the <a href="Superfund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superfund</a> program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

A  plume of lead, arsenic and <a href="Sulfates#Environmental_effects" title="wikilink">sulfates</a> (covering 9 percent of the watershed) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River. The largest inland <a href="reverse_osmosis" title="wikilink">reverse osmosis</a> plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction; completion of the ground water cleanup, however, is not projected until 2040.

The  site contained groundwater contamination from <a href="arsenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">arsenic</a> and lead, but the majority of the cleanup was completed in 2001.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>In Midvale, there are two Superfund sites that sit along 4 percent of the Jordan River. The Midvale Slag site is a  site adjacent to  of the Jordan River. From 1871 to 1958, the site contained five separate smelters that processed ores from Kennecott and other mines. The site was contaminated with lead, arsenic, <a href="Chromium#Precautions" title="wikilink">chromium</a>, and <a href="Cadmium#Toxicity" title="wikilink">cadmium</a>.
