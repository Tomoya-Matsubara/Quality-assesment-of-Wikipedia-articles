<p><strong>Charles Franklin Reaugh</strong> (pronounced &quot;Ray&quot;), the <em>Dean of Texas Painters</em>, was an artist, photographer, inventor, patron of the arts, and teacher. Born in Illinois in 1860 shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War, Reaugh moved to Texas with his family in 1876.</p>
<p>Reaugh studied art in St. Louis and Paris, where he became interested in pastels. A prolific artist, he created over 7000 works. He specialized in small pastel sketches of the wild and colorful <a href="Texas_longhorn_(cattle)" title="wikilink">Texas Longhorn</a> cattle breed, a subject he found to be both interesting and challenging to illustrate. Reaugh was also an inventor, creating his own art materials and tools, including a patented lap easel. He also patented a rotary pump and served on the board of directors for the Limacon Pump company in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>Reaugh was also a teacher, founding an art school in Dallas in 1897. For many years, Reaugh also led groups of art students on sketching exhibitions, traveling throughout the American Southwest.</p>
<p>Having given most of his possessions away, Reaugh died in poverty in 1945.</p>
<p>While Reaugh was not born in Texas, he was quite passionate about his adopted state. Several of Reaugh's works are on display at the <a href="Texas_State_Capitol" title="wikilink">Texas State Capitol</a>. Many of his other works are held by the <a href="Panhandle_Plains_Historical_Museum" title="wikilink">Panhandle Plains Historical Museum</a> at <a href="West_Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">West Texas A&amp;M University</a>, the <a href="Southwest_Collection" title="wikilink">Southwest Collection</a> at <a href="Texas_Tech_University" title="wikilink">Texas Tech University</a>, and the <a href="Harry_Ransom_Humanities_Research_Center" title="wikilink">Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center</a> at the <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas at Austin</a>.</p>
