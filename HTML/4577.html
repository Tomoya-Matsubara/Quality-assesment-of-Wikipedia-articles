<p><img src="Air-tractor1.jpg" title="fig:The air-tractor sledge in 1912" alt="The air-tractor sledge in 1912" width="300" /> The <strong>air-tractor sledge</strong> was a converted <a href="fixed-wing_aircraft" title="wikilink">fixed-wing aircraft</a> taken on the 1911&lt;U+2013&gt;14 <a href="Australasian_Antarctic_Expedition" title="wikilink">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>, the first plane to be taken to the <a href="Antarctic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antarctic</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Expedition leader <a href="Douglas_Mawson" title="wikilink">Douglas Mawson</a> had planned to use the <a href="Vickers_R.E.P._Type_Monoplane" title="wikilink">Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane</a> as a reconnaissance and <a href="search_and_rescue" title="wikilink">search and rescue</a> tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in <a href="Adelaide" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a>, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer <a href="Frank_Bickerton" title="wikilink">Frank Bickerton</a> spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a <a href="sledge" class="uri" title="wikilink">sledge</a>, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's <a href="landing_gear" title="wikilink">landing gear</a>. It was first tested on 15 November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.</p>
<p>Towing a train of four sledges, the air-tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at <a href="Cape_Denison" title="wikilink">Cape Denison</a>. The freezing conditions resulted in the engine's <a href="piston" title="wikilink">pistons</a> becoming jammed after just , and the air-tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913. In 2008 a team from the <a href="Mawson&#39;s_Huts" title="wikilink">Mawson's Huts Foundation</a> began searching for the remains of the air-tractor sledge; a seat was found in 2009, and parts of the tail a year later. The foundation believes that the air-tractor is still at Cape Denison, buried beneath the ice.</p>

<p>Although the two men were only slightly injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised <a href="sledge" class="uri" title="wikilink">sledge</a>.

<p>On 17 October, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying the coast and interior of Ad&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie Land and neighbouring <a href="King_George_V_Land" title="wikilink">King George V Land</a>. They were required to return to the base by 15 January, when the <em>Aurora</em> was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west of the hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave&lt;U+2014&gt;a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The air-tractor reached a speed of , covering the , expedition member <a href="Charles_Francis_Laseron" title="wikilink">Charles Laseron</a> recorded, &quot;in great style&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

At 4 am the next morning the party set off again,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> but the engine continued to struggle; oil ejected from an idle cylinder and the cylinder's lack of compression led Bickerton to suspect broken <a href="piston_ring" title="wikilink">piston rings</a> to be the root of the problem. This would take only a matter of hours to fix. As he later recorded, &quot;These thoughts were brought to a sudden close by the engine, without any warning, pulling up with such a jerk that the propeller was smashed.

Temperature records from the nearby <a href="Dumont_d&#39;Urville_Station" title="wikilink">Dumont d'Urville Station</a> showed that there had been extended periods (each of about six weeks) of above average temperatures in 1976 and 1981, suggesting the ice around the harbour could have melted.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Chris Henderson, the leader of the team, believes &quot;the frame sank in situ to the rock surface, three metres below the present ice surface&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Over the following three summers, the team extensively surveyed the area where they believed the air-tractor to be, using <a href="ground-penetrating_radar" title="wikilink">ground-penetrating radar</a>, <a href="differential_GPS" title="wikilink">differential GPS</a>, <a href="bathymetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">bathymetry</a> equipment, and ice <a href="auger" title="wikilink">augers</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The ice showed signs of a recent melt, and sat on rock level with the harbour bottom.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about  from where the team believes the frame to be buried.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></ref> On 1 January 2010, a day of unusually low tide, pieces from the end section of the tail were found by the edge of the harbour. The tail had been removed from the rest of the air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore its discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but according to Henderson it shows that &quot;the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100 years in this environment&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The team had hoped to return to Cape Denison over the 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 summer, but the <a href="2010_Antarctica_helicopter_crash" title="wikilink">crash of a French helicopter</a> near Dumont d'Urville Station in October 2010 forced a postponement.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></ref></p>
