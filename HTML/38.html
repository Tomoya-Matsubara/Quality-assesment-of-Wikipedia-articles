A variety of categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism, most of which treat atheism as &quot;absence of belief in deities&quot; in order to explore the varieties of this nontheism.</p>
<h3 id="range">Range</h3>
<p>Part of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining <em>atheism</em> arises from the similar ambiguity and controversy in defining words like <em>deity</em> and <em>God</em>. The plurality of wildly different <a href="conceptions_of_God" title="wikilink">conceptions of God</a> and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. In contexts where <em><a href="theism" class="uri" title="wikilink">theism</a></em> is defined as the belief in a <a href="monotheism" title="wikilink">singular</a> <a href="personal_God" title="wikilink">personal God</a>, for example, people who believe in a variety of other deities may be classified as atheists, including <a href="deism" title="wikilink">deists</a> and even <a href="polytheism" title="wikilink">polytheists</a>. In the 20th century, this view has fallen into disfavor as <em>theism</em> has come to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a god, to the existence of any spiritual, <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>, or <a href="Transcendence_(religion)" title="wikilink">transcendental</a> concepts, such as those of Hinduism and Buddhism.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="implicit-vs.-explicit">Implicit vs. explicit</h3>

<p>Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Minimally, atheism may be seen as the absence of belief in one or more gods. It has been contended that this broad definition includes newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, <a href="d&#39;Holbach" class="uri" title="wikilink">d'Holbach</a> said that &quot;All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="George_H._Smith" title="wikilink">George H. Smith</a> (1979) suggested that: &quot;The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Smith coined the term <em>implicit atheism</em> to refer to &quot;the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it&quot; and <em>explicit atheism</em> to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief.</p>
<p>The view that children are born atheist is relatively recent. Prior to the 18th century, the existence of God was so universally accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called <em>theistic <a href="innatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">innatism</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It is also asserted that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis&lt;U+2014&gt;that atheists make <a href="deathbed_conversion" title="wikilink">deathbed conversions</a>, or that &quot;there are no <a href="atheists_in_foxholes" title="wikilink">atheists in foxholes</a>.&quot; Atheists dispute this claim by citing examples of &quot;atheists in foxholes&quot;;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> also, atheist organizations of military personnel have been created in response.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Philosophers such as <a href="Antony_Flew" title="wikilink">Antony Flew</a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and <a href="Michael_Martin_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Michael Martin</a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> have contrasted strong (positive) atheism with weak (negative) atheism. Strong atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Weak atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a weak or a strong atheist.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The terms <em>weak</em> and <em>strong</em> are relatively recent; however, the equivalent terms <em>negative</em> and <em>positive</em> atheism have been used in the philosophical literature<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and (in a slightly different sense) in Catholic apologetics.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Under this demarcation of atheism, most <a href="agnosticism" title="wikilink">agnostics</a> qualify as weak atheists.</p>
<p>While agnosticism can be seen as a form of weak atheism,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> most agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism, which they may consider no more justified than theism, or requires an equal conviction.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The supposed unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of God is sometimes seen as indication that atheism requires a <a href="leap_of_faith" title="wikilink">leap of faith</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven <em><a href="faith#religious_faith" title="wikilink">religious</a></em> propositions deserve as much disbelief as all <em>other</em> unproven propositions,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and that the unprovability of God's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Scottish philosopher <a href="J._J._C._Smart" title="wikilink">J.

<p>The broadest demarcation with respect to atheistic rationale is between practical and theoretical atheism. The different forms of theoretical atheism each derive from a particular rationale or philosophical argument. In contrast, practical atheism requires no specific argument, and can include indifference to and ignorance of the idea of gods.</p>
<h3 id="practical-atheism">Practical atheism</h3>
<p>In <em>practical</em>, or <em><a href="pragmatism" title="wikilink">pragmatic</a></em>, atheism, also known as <a href="apatheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">apatheism</a>, individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. The existence of gods is not denied, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> A form of practical atheism with implications for the <a href="scientific_community" title="wikilink">scientific community</a> is <a href="methodological_naturalism" title="wikilink">methodological naturalism</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the &quot;tacit adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within <a href="scientific_method" title="wikilink">scientific method</a> with or without fully accepting or believing it.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Practical atheism can take various forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absence of religious motivation&lt;U+2014&gt;belief in gods does not motivate moral action, religious action, or any other form of action;</li>
<li>Active exclusion of the problem of gods and religion from intellectual pursuit and practical action;</li>
<li>Indifference&lt;U+2014&gt;the absence of any interest in the problems of gods and religion; or</li>
<li>Ignorance&lt;U+2014&gt;lacking any idea of gods.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, practical atheism has been associated with moral failure, willful ignorance and impiety. Those considered practical atheists were said to behave as though God, ethics and social responsibility did not exist; they abandoned duty and embraced <a href="hedonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">hedonism</a>. According to the French Catholic philosopher &lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne Borne, &quot;Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="theoretical-atheism">Theoretical atheism</h3>

<p>Theoretical, or contemplative, atheism explicitly posits arguments against the existence of gods, responding to common <a href="existence_of_God#Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God" title="wikilink">theistic arguments</a> such as the <a href="argument_from_design" title="wikilink">argument from design</a> or <a href="Pascal&#39;s_Wager" title="wikilink">Pascal's Wager</a>. The theoretical reasons for rejecting gods assume various psychological, sociological, metaphysical, and epistemological forms.</p>
<h4 id="epistemological-arguments">Epistemological arguments</h4>

<p>Epistemological atheism argues that people cannot know God or determine the existence of God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is <a href="agnosticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnosticism</a>, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of <a href="immanence" class="uri" title="wikilink">immanence</a>, divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a> is locked in the <a href="Subject_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">subject</a>. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The <a href="Rationalism" title="wikilink">rationalistic</a> agnosticism of <a href="Immanuel_Kant" title="wikilink">Kant</a> and the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. <a href="Philosophical_skepticism" title="wikilink">Skepticism</a>, based on the ideas of <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">Hume</a>, asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know the existence of God. The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic world-view.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Other forms of atheistic argumentation that may qualify as epistemological, including <a href="logical_positivism" title="wikilink">logical positivism</a> and <a href="ignosticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ignosticism</a>, assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as &quot;God&quot; and statements such as &quot;God is all-powerful&quot;. <a href="Theological_noncognitivism" title="wikilink">Theological noncognitivism</a> holds that the statement &quot;God exists&quot; does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals classify into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers <a href="Alfred_Ayer" title="wikilink">A. J. Ayer</a> and <a href="Theodore_M._Drange" title="wikilink">Theodore M. Drange</a> reject both categories, stating that both camps accept &quot;God exists&quot; as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="metaphysical-arguments">Metaphysical arguments</h4>

<p>Metaphysical atheism is based on metaphysical <a href="monism" class="uri" title="wikilink">monism</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the view that reality is homogeneous and indivisible. Absolute metaphysical atheists subscribe to some form of <a href="physicalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">physicalism</a>, hence they explicitly deny the existence of non-physical beings. Relative metaphysical atheists maintain an implicit denial of a particular concept of God based on the incongruity between their individual philosophies and attributes commonly applied to God, such as <a href="transcendence" class="uri" title="wikilink">transcendence</a>, a <a href="Personal_God" title="wikilink">personal aspect</a>, or unity. Examples of relative metaphysical atheism include <a href="pantheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pantheism</a>, <a href="panentheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">panentheism</a>, and <a href="deism" class="uri" title="wikilink">deism</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Atheism_in_Hinduism" title="wikilink">Atheistic schools</a> are found in <a href="Hinduism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hinduism</a>, which is otherwise a very theistic religion.

This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as a <a href="nastika" title="wikilink">heterodox</a> system and is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Carvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess.

<p>The Roman poet <a href="Lucretius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucretius</a> agreed that, if there were gods, they were unconcerned with humanity and unable to affect the natural world.

<p>The <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Reformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reformation</a> eras witnessed a resurgence in religious fervor, as evidenced by the proliferation of new religious orders, confraternities, and popular devotions in the Catholic world, and the appearance of increasingly austere Protestant sects such as the <a href="Calvinists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calvinists</a>. This era of interconfessional rivalry permitted an even wider scope of theological and philosophical speculation, much of which would later be used to advance a religiously skeptical world-view.</p>
<p><a href="Criticism_of_Christianity" title="wikilink">Criticism of Christianity</a> became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious malaise, according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as <a href="Thomas_Hobbes" title="wikilink">Thomas Hobbes</a>, espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences. In the late 17th century, <a href="Deism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deism</a> came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as <a href="John_Toland_(Irish_Philosopher)" title="wikilink">John Toland</a>, and practically all the <em><a href="philosophe" title="wikilink">philosophes</a></em> of 18th-century France and England held to some form of Deism. Despite their ridicule of Christianity, many Deists held atheism in scorn. The first openly atheistic thinkers, such as <a href="Baron_d&#39;Holbach" title="wikilink">Baron d'Holbach</a>, appeared in the late 18th century, when expressing disbelief in God became a less dangerous position.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume</a> was the most systematic exponent of Enlightenment thought, developing a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, undermining the metaphysical basis of natural theology.</p>

<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>

<p>It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists in the world. Respondents to religious-belief polls may define &quot;atheism&quot; differently or draw different distinctions between <em>atheism</em>, non-religious beliefs, and non-theistic religious and spiritual beliefs. In addition, people in some regions of the world refrain from reporting themselves as atheists to avoid social stigma, <a href="Discrimination_of_atheists" title="wikilink">discrimination</a>, and <a href="persecution_of_atheists" title="wikilink">persecution</a>. A 2005 survey published in <em><a href="Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia_Britannica" title="wikilink">Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia Britannica</a></em> found that the non-religious make up about 11.9% of the world's population, and atheists about 2.3%. This figure does not include those who follow atheistic religions, such as some Buddhists.<ref name="Britannica demographics"></p>
<ul>
<li>2.3% Atheists: Persons professing atheism, skepticism, disbelief, or irreligion, including the militantly antireligious (opposed to all religion).</li>
<li>11.9% Nonreligious: Persons professing no religion, nonbelievers, agnostics, freethinkers, uninterested, or dereligionized secularists indifferent to all religion but not militantly so.</li>
</ul>
<p></ref> A November&lt;U+2013&gt;December 2006 poll published in the <em><a href="Financial_Times" title="wikilink">Financial Times</a></em> gives rates for the United States and five European countries. It found that Americans are more likely than Europeans to believe in any form of God or Supreme Being (73%). Of the European adults surveyed, Italians are the most likely to express this belief (62%) and the French the least likely (27%). In France, 32% declared themselves atheists, and an additional 32% declared themselves <a href="agnostic" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnostic</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> An official <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> survey provides corresponding figures: 18% of the EU population do not believe in a god; 27% accept the existence of some supernatural &quot;spiritual life force&quot;, while 52% affirm belief in a specific god. The proportion of believers rises to 65% among those who had left school by the age of fifteen; survey respondents who considered themselves to be from a strict family background were more likely to believe in god than those who felt their upbringing lacked firm rules.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>A letter published in <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a></em> in 1998 reported a survey suggesting that belief in a personal God or <a href="afterlife" class="uri" title="wikilink">afterlife</a> was at an all-time low among the members of the U.S. <a href="National_Academy_of_Science" title="wikilink">National Academy of Science</a>, only 7.0% of whom believed in a personal God as compared to more than 85% of the general U.S. population.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> In the same year <a href="Frank_Sulloway" title="wikilink">Frank Sulloway</a> of <a href="MIT" class="uri" title="wikilink">MIT</a> and <a href="Michael_Shermer" title="wikilink">Michael Shermer</a> of <a href="California_State_University" title="wikilink">California State University</a> conducted a study which found in their polling sample of &quot;credentialed&quot; U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a <a href="correlation" class="uri" title="wikilink">correlation</a> indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Such an inverse <a href="correlation" class="uri" title="wikilink">correlation</a> between <a href="religiosity_and_intelligence" title="wikilink">religiosity and intelligence</a> has been found by 39 studies carried out between 1927 and 2002, according to an article in <em>Mensa Magazine</em>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> These findings broadly concur with a 1958 statistical <a href="meta-analysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meta-analysis</a> from Professor <a href="Michael_Argyle_(psychologist)" title="wikilink">Michael Argyle</a> of <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a>. He analyzed seven research studies that had investigated correlation between attitude to religion and <a href="Intelligence_quotient" title="wikilink">measured intelligence</a> among school and college students from the U.S. Although a clear negative correlation was found, the analysis did not identify causality but noted that factors such as authoritarian family background and social class may also have played a part.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>However, evidence on the relationship between religious belief and educational achievement is mixed. Some research in the United States has found that religiosity in general is correlated with greater educational attainment and scholastic performance. The effect of religion on education can differ depending on what type of religion a student professes. <a href="Fundamentalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fundamentalist</a> Christians, especially women, tend to acquire fewer years of education than others do.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>Although people who self-identify as atheists are usually assumed to be <a href="irreligion" title="wikilink">irreligious</a>, some sects within major religions have atheistic beliefs, and even reject the existence of a personal, creator diety.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In recent years, certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers, such as <a href="atheist_Jew" title="wikilink">atheistic</a> or <a href="humanistic_Judaism" title="wikilink">humanistic Judaism</a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> and <a href="Agnostic_theism" title="wikilink">Christian atheists</a>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>As the strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in God, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the <a href="moral_universalism" title="wikilink">moral universalism</a> of <a href="humanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanism</a>, which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to <a href="moral_nihilism" title="wikilink">moral nihilism</a>, which holds that morality is meaningless.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout its history, however, atheism has commonly been equated with immorality, based on the belief that morality is directly derived from God, and thus cannot be attained without appealing to God.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Moral precepts such as &quot;murder is wrong&quot; are seen as <a href="divine_law" title="wikilink">divine laws</a>, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a <a href="false_analogy" title="wikilink">false analogy</a>, and that morality does not depend upon a lawmaker in the same way that laws do,<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> based on the <a href="Euthyphro_dilemma" title="wikilink">Euthyphro dilemma</a>, which either renders God unnecessary or morality arbitrary.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>Philosopher <a href="Julian_Baggini" title="wikilink">Julian Baggini</a> asserts that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> He argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves&lt;U+2014&gt;to be able to discern, for example, that &quot;thou shalt steal&quot; is immoral even if one's religion instructs it&lt;U+2014&gt;and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Atheists such as <a href="Sam_Harris_(author)" title="wikilink">Sam Harris</a> have argued that Western religions' reliance on divine authority lends itself to <a href="authoritarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">authoritarianism</a> and <a href="dogma" title="wikilink">dogmatism</a>.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Indeed, <a href="religious_fundamentalism" title="wikilink">religious fundamentalism</a> and <a href="psychology_of_religion" title="wikilink">extrinsic religion</a> (when religion is held because it serves other, more ultimate interests<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a>) have been correlated with authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> This argument, combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate the dangers of religion, such as the <a href="Crusade" title="wikilink">Crusades</a>, <a href="inquisition" title="wikilink">inquisitions</a>, and <a href="witch_trial" title="wikilink">witch trials</a>, are often used by <a href="antireligion" title="wikilink">antireligious</a> atheists to justify their views.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Theists have made very similar arguments, however, against atheists based on the <a href="state_atheism" title="wikilink">state atheism</a> of <a href="communist_state" title="wikilink">communist states</a>.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn2"> &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt;a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for [reasons that depend] on how God is being conceived.&quot;<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn19">The <em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em> also records an earlier, irregular formation, <em>atheonism</em>, dated from about 1534.

<li id="fn21">In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, <em>atheism</em> is usually described as &quot;disbelief in God,&quot; rather than more generally as &quot;disbelief in deities.&quot; A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of <em>atheism</em> encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in <a href="polytheism" title="wikilink">polytheistic</a> deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term <em><a href="adevism" class="uri" title="wikilink">adevism</a></em> was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities. <a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn42">. &quot;Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'.

<li id="fn99">According to Dawkins (2006), p. 103. Dawkins cites Bell, Paul. &quot;Would you believe it?&quot; <em>Mensa Magazine</em>, UK Edition, Feb. 2002, pp. 12&lt;U+2013&gt;13. Analyzing 43 studies carried out since 1927, Bell found that all but four reported such a connection, and he concluded that &quot;the higher one's intelligence or education level, the less one is likely to be religious or hold 'beliefs' of any kind.&quot;<a href="#fnref99" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn112">For <a href="Kant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kant</a>, the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for &quot;Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&lt;U+2026&gt; .&quot; (<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, A811).<a href="#fnref112" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
