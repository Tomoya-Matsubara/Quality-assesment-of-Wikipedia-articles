<p>The <strong><em>Hennepin</em></strong> is a <a href="shipwreck" class="uri" title="wikilink">shipwreck</a> off the east coast of <a href="Lake_Michigan" title="wikilink">Lake Michigan</a>, west of <a href="South_Haven,_Michigan" title="wikilink">South Haven, Michigan</a>. The ship was originally built in October 1888 and sank on August 18, 1927. <a href="Michigan_Shipwreck_Research_Associates" title="wikilink">Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates</a> found the ship in 2006 and conducted several dives to assess the condition of the wreck.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The wreck was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> on February 1, 2008.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is significant as the first self-unloading <a href="bulk_carrier" title="wikilink">bulk carrier</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The ship was originally built as the <em>George H. Dyer</em> by the firm of Wolf and Davidson in <a href="Milwaukee,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>. It was equipped with a steam engine at the time. The ship changed owners a few times, and in 1898, it was later the <em>Hennepin</em>, after <a href="Louis_Hennepin" title="wikilink">Louis Hennepin</a>, an explorer of the <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 27, 1901, the ship caught fire in <a href="Buffalo,_New_York" title="wikilink">Buffalo, New York</a>. The fire damaged most of the upper deck and most of the machinery. The ship was sold to the Lake Shore Stone Company, who fitted it with a conveyor belt and made it a self-unloading ship. This was the world's first self-unloading ship, and it provided the paradigm for the many self-unloading vessels in use today. The ship had a 1600 ton capacity. It was put to work loading stone from a <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a> in <a href="Stone_Haven,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Stone Haven, Wisconsin</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Later, in 1923, it was purchased by Construction Materials Corporation and put to use hauling <a href="construction_aggregate" title="wikilink">construction aggregate</a> from a quarry on the <a href="Grand_River_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">Grand River</a> to <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>. The hull was wearing out and becoming unstable, so the ship was converted to a barge by removing its engine. It was hauled by the <a href="tugboat" title="wikilink">tugboats</a> <em>Ufasco</em> in 1926 and <em>Lotus</em> in 1927.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="wreck-event">Wreck event</h2>
<p>On August 18, 1927, around 10:30 AM, the <em>Hennepin</em> ran into a <a href="squall" class="uri" title="wikilink">squall</a> in the middle of Lake Michigan. The vessel had sprung a leak, and although the crew worked to save the ship, the pumps could not keep up with the volume of water coming in. The crew worked until 2:30 PM that afternoon, but they were unsuccessful, and the crew abandoned ship for the safety of the tugboat <em>Lotus</em>. The <em>Hennepin</em> finally sank around 6:00 PM. Upon the return to port, Captain Ole Hansen said, &quot;She died a hard death.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates members were searching for the wreck of <a href="Northwest_Orient_Airlines_Flight_2501" title="wikilink">Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501</a> in 2006. In the process of mapping out sections of the lake, they discovered debris on the bottom that appeared to be a wreck. At first, they identified a small structure that they nicknamed a &quot;rib cage&quot;, but more searching revealed a ship. They sent a team of <a href="technical_diving" title="wikilink">technical divers</a> to explore the wreck, which was in about  of water. The team examined a <a href="Capstan_(nautical)" title="wikilink">capstan</a> and discovered the name &quot;G.H. Dyer&quot; stamped onto the cover, which confirmed it as the <em>Hennepin</em>. The pilothouse had been blown off when it sank, but the wheel was still in place and intact. The ship had hit <a href="stern" class="uri" title="wikilink">stern</a>-first as identified by the wreckage. The conveyor belts and the A-frame crane structure were still in place and further identified the ship as the <em>Hennepin</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
