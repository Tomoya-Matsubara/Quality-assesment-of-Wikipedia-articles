<p>A <strong>trolleybus</strong> (also known as <strong>trolley <a href="bus" class="uri" title="wikilink">bus</a></strong>, <strong>trolley coach</strong>, <strong>trackless trolley</strong>, <strong>trackless tram</strong> or <strong>trolley</strong>) is an <a href="electric_bus" title="wikilink">electric bus</a> that draws its <a href="electricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">electricity</a> from overhead wires (generally suspended from roadside posts) using spring-loaded <a href="trolley_pole" title="wikilink">trolley poles</a>. Two wires and poles are required to complete the electrical circuit, unlike a <a href="tram" title="wikilink">tram or streetcar</a>, which normally uses the track as part of the electrical path and thus needs only one wire and pole.</p>

This experimental demonstration continued until 13 June 1882, after which there was little progress in Europe, although separate experiments were conducted in the USA. The next development was when <a href="Lombard_G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin" title="wikilink">Lombard G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin</a> operated an experimental line at the <a href="Paris_Exhibition_of_1900" title="wikilink">Paris Exhibition of 1900</a> after four years of trials. <a href="Max_Schiemann" title="wikilink">Max Schiemann</a> made the biggest step when on 10 July 1901 the world's first passenger-carrying trolleybus operated at Bielathal (near <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a>), in Germany. Schiemann built and operated the Bielathal system, and is credited with developing the under-running trolley current collection system, with two horizontally parallel overhead wires and rigid trolleypoles spring-loaded to hold them up to the wires. Although the Bielathal system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system. In the early days there were a few different methods of current collection. The Cedes-Stoll system, designed by Carl Stoll, operated near Dresden between 1902 and 1904, and in <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>. The Lloyd-K&lt;U+00F6&gt;hler or Bremen system was tried out in <a href="Bremen_(city)" title="wikilink">Bremen</a>, and the <a href=":it:Filovia" title="wikilink">Filovia</a> was demonstrated near <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> and <a href="Bradford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bradford</a> became the first cities to operate trolleybuses in the United Kingdom on 20 June 1911. Bradford was also the last to operate trolleybuses in the UK, the system closing on 26 March 1972. The last rear-entrance trolleybus in Britain was also in Bradford and is now owned by the <a href="Bradford_Trolleybus_Association" title="wikilink">Bradford Trolleybus Association</a>. <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a> was the first to replace a tram route with trolleybuses, while <a href="Wolverhampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wolverhampton</a> under the direction of Charles Owen Silvers turned the &quot;trackless tram&quot; into the trolleybus. There were 50 trolleybus systems in the UK, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>'s being the largest. By the time trolleybuses arrived in Britain in 1911, the Schiemann system was well-established and was the most common, although the short-lived <a href="Stockport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockport</a> operation used the Lloyd-K&lt;U+00F6&gt;lher system and <a href="Keighley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keighley</a> used the Cedes-Stoll system.</p>
<p>In the United States, some cities, led by the <a href="Brooklyn-Manhattan_Transit_Corporation" title="wikilink">Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation</a> (BMT—New York), subscribed to the <a href="all-four" class="uri" title="wikilink">all-four</a> concept of using buses, trolleybuses, <a href="tram" title="wikilink">trams</a> (in US called <em>streetcars</em> or <em>trolleys</em>) and <a href="rapid_transit" title="wikilink">rapid transit</a> subway and/or elevated lines (metros), as appropriate, for routes ranging from lightly-used to the heaviest trunk line. Buses and trolleybuses in particular were seen as entry systems that could later be upgraded to rail as appropriate. Although the BMT in <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a> built only one trolleybus line, other cities, notably <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco, California</a> and <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, built larger systems and still maintain &quot;all-four&quot;.</p>
<p>A number of trolleybus lines in the United States came into existence when a tracked trolley/tram route did not have sufficient ridership to warrant track maintenance or reconstruction. In a similar manner, a proposed tram scheme in Leeds, United Kingdom, was changed to a trolleybus scheme to cut costs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Trolleybuses are uncommon today in North America, but they remain common in many European countries, and in Russia and China, generally occupying the niche between street railways (trams) and diesel buses. Worldwide, around 340 cities or metropolitan areas are served by trolleybuses today.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (Further detail under <a href="Trolleybus#Use_and_preservation" title="wikilink">Use and preservation</a>, below.)</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p><img src="San_Francisco_Nob_Hill_2.jpg" title="fig:A San Francisco Muni trolleybus climbing Nob Hill" alt="A San Francisco Muni trolleybus climbing Nob Hill" width="175" /> <img src="Trolleybus_Cristalis_ligne_4.JPG" title="fig:Irisbus Cristalis trolleybus in Limoges, France" alt="Irisbus Cristalis trolleybus in Limoges, France" width="180" /> Trolleybuses are advantageous on hilly routes, as <a href="electric_motor" title="wikilink">electric motors</a> are more effective than <a href="diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel engines</a> for climbing steep hills. Unlike combustion engines, electric motors draw power from a central plant and can be overloaded for several minutes without damage. <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> and <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>, both hilly United States cities, use trolleybuses partly for this reason, another being improved air quality. Given their acceleration and braking performance, trolleybuses easily outperform diesel buses on flat stretches as well.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses' <a href="rubber" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubber</a> <a href="tire" title="wikilink">tires</a> have better <a href="adhesion" class="uri" title="wikilink">adhesion</a> than trams' steel wheels on steel rails, giving them better hill-climbing capability and braking. Unlike rail vehicles (where side tracks are not available), an out-of-service vehicle can be moved to the side of the road and its trolley poles disconnected, allowing other vehicles to pass. Additionally, because they are not tracked, trolleybuses can pull over to the curb as a diesel bus does, eliminating boarding islands in the street.</p>
<p>Like other <a href="electric_vehicle" title="wikilink">electric vehicles</a>, trolleybuses are more environmentally friendly than <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil-fuel</a> or <a href="hydrocarbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrocarbon</a>-based vehicles (<a href="Gasoline" title="wikilink">petrol/gasoline</a>, <a href="Diesel_fuel" title="wikilink">diesel</a>, <a href="alcohol" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcohol</a>, etc.). However the power is not free, having to be produced at centralised <a href="power_plant" title="wikilink">power plants</a>, with attendant transmission losses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, centrally-produced power is produced more efficiently, not bound to a specific fuel source and more amenable to pollution control as a single-source supply than are individual vehicles with their own engines that exhaust noxious gases and <a href="particulate" title="wikilink">particulates</a> at street level. Moreover, some cities, like <a href="Calgary,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Calgary, Alberta</a>, run their <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> networks using wind energy,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> which is effectively emission-free once the turbines are built and installed. Other cities like <a href="Vancouver" title="wikilink">Vancouver, B.C.</a> use hydroelectricity to provide power for trolley buses. A further advantage of trolleybuses is that they can generate electricity from <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> while braking, a process known as <a href="regenerative_braking" title="wikilink">regenerative braking</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike buses or trams, trolleybuses are almost silent, lacking the noise of a diesel engine or wheels on rails. Such noise as there is tends to emanate from auxiliary systems such as power steering pumps and air conditioning. Early trolleybuses without these systems were even quieter, and in the UK at least were often referred to as the &quot;Silent Service&quot;. The quietness did have its disadvantages though, with quite a number of pedestrians falling victim to what was also known as &quot;the Silent Death&quot;.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses are specially favoured where <a href="electricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">electricity</a> is abundant and cheap. Examples are the extensive systems in Vancouver, Canada and <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>, USA, both of which draw <a href="hydroelectric" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroelectric</a> power from the <a href="Columbia_River" title="wikilink">Columbia River</a> and other Pacific river systems. Seattle benefits doubly, with steep gradients near the <a href="Downtown,_Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Downtown</a> <a href="dockland" title="wikilink">waterfront</a> and on <a href="Queen_Anne,_Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Queen Anne</a>, <a href="First_Hill,_Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">First</a>, and <a href="Capitol_Hill,_Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Capitol Hills</a>. San Francisco operates its system using hydro power from the city-owned <a href="Hetch_Hetchy_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Hetch Hetchy</a> generating plant.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses are used extensively in large European cities such as <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>, <a href="Bratislava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bratislava</a>, <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>, <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>, <a href="Kiev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kiev</a>, <a href="Lyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyon</a>, <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a>, <a href="Minsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minsk</a>, <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>, <a href="Riga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Riga</a>, <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a> and <a href="Sofia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sofia</a>, as well as smaller ones such as <a href="Arnhem_trolleybus" title="wikilink">Arnhem</a>, <a href="Bergen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bergen</a>, <a href="Brasov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brasov</a>, <a href="Brest_(Belarus)" title="wikilink">Brest (Belarus)</a>, <a href="Coimbra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coimbra</a>, <a href="Gdynia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gdynia</a>, <a href="Lausanne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lausanne</a>, <a href="Limoges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Limoges</a>, <a href="Luzern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luzern</a>, <a href="Parma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parma</a>, <a href="Piatra_Neam&lt;U+0163&gt;" title="wikilink">Piatra Neam&lt;U+0163&gt;</a>, <a href="Plze&lt;U+0148&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plze&lt;U+0148&gt;</a>, <a href="Pre&lt;U+0161&gt;ov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pre&lt;U+0161&gt;ov</a>, <a href="Salzburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salzburg</a>, <a href="Solingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solingen</a>, <a href="Szeged" class="uri" title="wikilink">Szeged</a>, <a href="Tallinn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tallinn</a> and <a href="Yalta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yalta</a>.</p>
<p>Realising the advantages of these <a href="zero-emission_vehicle" title="wikilink">zero-emission vehicles</a>, some other European cities have started to expand their systems again. Other cities such as <a href="Lecce" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lecce</a> will introduce new trolleybus systems.</p>
<p>In <a href="Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, the trolleybus system has survived because <a href="Harvard_(MBTA_station)" title="wikilink">Harvard Station</a> has a tunnel that was once used for trams that requires left-side doors and has fume concerns. Buses also use the tunnel, but the trolleybuses remain due to popular support.</p>
<p><img src="Trolley3WireSwitch.jpg" title="fig:Trolleybus wire switch" alt="Trolleybus wire switch" width="250" /> <img src="Catenaryswitch.jpg" title="fig:Indicator for a wire switch" alt="Indicator for a wire switch" width="200" /> <img src="TrollyHeadworks5875.JPG" title="fig:Pole headworks with springs and dampers" alt="Pole headworks with springs and dampers" width="200" /> <img src="TrollyRopes5874.JPG" title="fig:Insulated poles, contactors, and pull–ropes" alt="Insulated poles, contactors, and pull–ropes" width="175" /></p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Re-routings, temporary or permanent, are not usually readily available outside of &quot;downtown&quot; areas where the buses may be re-routed via adjacent business area streets where other trolleybus routes operate. This problem was highlighted in Vancouver in early 2008 when an explosion closed Broadway, a heavily-used trolley route. Because of the closure, trolleys were forced to detour several kilometers off their route in order to stay on the wires, leaving major portions of their routes unserved and trolleys well off schedule.</p>
<p>Some trolleybus systems have been criticised for aesthetic reasons, with city residents complaining that the jumble of overhead wires was unsightly.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Intersections often have a &quot;webbed ceiling&quot; appearance, due to multiple crossing and converging sets of line wires.</p>
<p>Dewirements sometimes occur, leaving the bus stranded without power, although this is relatively rare on systems with well-maintained overhead wire, hangers, fittings and &quot;contact shoes&quot;.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses cannot overtake one another in regular service unless two separate sets of wires with a switch are provided or the vehicles are equipped with off-wire capability, but the latter is an increasingly common feature of new trolleybuses.</p>
<h2 id="recent-power-developments">Recent power developments</h2>
<p>With the introduction of hybrid designs, trolleybuses are no longer tied to overhead wires. Since the 1980s, trolleybus systems such as <a href="San_Francisco_Municipal_Railway" title="wikilink">Muni</a> in San Francisco, <a href="TransLink_(Vancouver)" title="wikilink">TransLink</a> in Vancouver and <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>, among others, have purchased trolleybuses equipped with batteries to allow the vehicles to operate short to considerably long distances away from the wires. <a href="Supercapacitor" title="wikilink">Supercapacitors</a> may be also used to move short distances.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses can optionally be equipped either with limited off-wire capability—a small diesel engine or battery pack—for auxiliary or emergency use only, or full <a href="dual-mode_bus" title="wikilink">dual-mode capability</a>. A simple auxiliary power unit can allow a trolleybus to get around a route blockage or can reduce the amount (or complexity) of overhead wiring needed at operating garages (depots). This capability has become increasingly common in newer trolleybuses, particularly in North America and Western Europe, where the vast majority of new trolleybuses delivered since the 1990s are fitted with at least limited off-wire capability. These have gradually replaced older trolleybuses which lacked such capability. In <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, new trolleybuses (known as &quot;trackless trolleys&quot; there) that were placed in service by <a href="SEPTA" class="uri" title="wikilink">SEPTA</a> in 2008 are equipped with small <a href="Hybrid_electric_vehicle" title="wikilink">hybrid</a> diesel-electric power units for operating short distances off-wire, instead of using a conventional diesel drive train or battery-only system for their off-wire movement.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="King_County_Metro" title="wikilink">King County Metro</a> in <a href="Seattle" title="wikilink">Seattle, Washington</a> and <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority" title="wikilink">MBTA</a> in <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston</a> use or have used <a href="dual-mode_bus" title="wikilink">dual-mode buses</a> that run on electric power from overhead wires on a fixed right-of-way and on <a href="Diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel</a> power on city streets. Metro used special-order articulated <a href="Societ&lt;U+00E0&gt;_Italiana_Ernesto_Breda" title="wikilink">Breda</a> buses with the center axle driven electrically and the rear (third) axle driven using a conventional power pack, with electricity used for clean operation in the <a href="King_County_Metro#Downtown_Seattle_Transit_Tunnel" title="wikilink">downtown transit tunnel</a>. They were introduced in 1990 and retired in 2005, replaced with cleaner hybrid buses, although 59 of 236 had their diesel propulsion equipment removed and continue (as of 2010) in trolley bus service on non-tunnel routes. MBTA uses dual-mode buses on its new (2004-opened) <a href="Silver_Line_(MBTA)" title="wikilink">Silver Line (Waterfront)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<p>With increasing diesel fuel costs and particulate matter and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions problems in many cities, trolleybuses may be seen as the best option, either as the primary transit mode or as a supplement to rapid transit and commuter rail networks.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that the trolleybus will become obsolete in a future <a href="hydrogen_economy" title="wikilink">hydrogen economy</a>, but direct electric transmission is far more efficient (by a factor of two or more) than conversion of energy into <a href="hydrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, transportation and storage of the hydrogen and its conversion back into electricity by <a href="fuel_cell" title="wikilink">fuel cells</a>.</p>
<p>As trolleybuses are electric, they produce very little noise compared with a diesel- or petrol-engined vehicle. While this is mainly seen as a benefit, it does also make it is easier for unobservant pedestrians and other motorists to miss hearing a trolleybus when crossing a street, and risk being struck. For this reason, in Australia trolleybuses were sometimes known as &quot;whispering death&quot;.</p>
<p>Trolleybuses can share overhead wires and other electrical infrastructure (such as substations) with tramways. This can result in cost savings when trolleybuses are added to a transport system that already has trams, though this refers only to potential savings over the cost of installing and operating trolleybuses alone.</p>
<h2 id="trolleybus-wire-switch">Trolleybus wire switch</h2>
<p>Trolleybus wire switches (referred to as &quot;frogs&quot; in some countries) are used where a trolleybus line branches into two. A switch may be either in a &quot;straight through&quot; or &quot;turnout&quot; position; it normally remains in the &quot;straight through&quot; position unless it has been triggered, and reverts to it after a few seconds. Triggering is often caused by a pair of contacts or <a href="electromagnets" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromagnets</a>, with one attached to each trolleybus wire, close to but before the switch itself.</p>
<p>Multiple branches may be handled by installing more than one switch. For example, to provide straight-through, left-turn or right-turn branches at an intersection, one switch is installed some distance from the intersection to choose a line over the left-turn lane, and another switch is mounted close to the intersection to choose between straight through and a right turn.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> (This would be the arrangement in countries such as the US, where <a href="traffic_directionality" title="wikilink">traffic directionality</a> is right-handed; in left-handed traffic countries such as Britain and New Zealand, the switch some distance from the intersection would be used to access the right-turn lanes, and the switch close to the intersection would be for the left-turn fork instead.)</p>
<p>Three common types of switch<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> exist: Power-on/Power-off (the picture of a switch above is of this type), Selectric, and Fahslabend.</p>
<p>A Power-on/Power-off switch is triggered if the trolleybus is drawing power from the overhead wires, usually by accelerating, when the poles pass over the contacts. (The contacts are lined up on the wires in this case.) If the trolleybus &quot;coasts&quot; through the switch it will not activate. Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia, have a &quot;power-coast&quot; toggle switch that turns the power on or off. This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or accelerating through a switch without activating it.</p>
<p>A Selectric switch has a similar design, but the contacts on the wires are skewed, often at a 45-degree angle, rather than being lined up. This skew means that a bus going straight through will not trigger the switch, but a trolleybus attempting a sharp turn (usually a right turn in countries with right-handed traffic) will cause its poles to meet the wires in a matching skew with one pole ahead of the other, which will trigger the switch.</p>
<p>For a <a href="Fahslabend" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fahslabend</a> switch, the trolleybus's turn indicator (or a separate driver-controlled switch) causes a coded radio signal to be sent from a transmitter, often attached to a trolley pole. The receiver is attached to the switch, and causes it to trigger if the correct code is received. This has the advantage that the driver does not need to be accelerating the bus (as with a Power-on/Power-off switch) or trying to make a sharp turn (as with a Selectric switch).</p>

<h2 id="double-decker-trolleybuses">Double-decker trolleybuses</h2>
<p>Since the end of 1997, no double-decker trolleybuses have been in service anywhere in the world, but in the past several manufacturers made such vehicles. Most builders of double-deck trolleybuses were in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, but there were a few, usually solitary, instances of such trolleybuses being built in other countries, including in Germany by <a href="Henschel_&amp;_Son" title="wikilink">Henschel</a> (for Hamburg); in Italy by <a href="Lancia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancia</a> (for Porto, Portugal); in Russia by the Yaroslavl motor plant (for Moscow) and in Spain by Maquitrans (for Barcelona).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> British manufacturers of double-deck trolleybuses included AEC, BUT, Crossley, Guy, Leyland, Karrier, Sunbeam and others.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2001, <a href="Citybus_(Hong_Kong)" title="wikilink">Citybus (Hong Kong)</a> converted a <a href="Dennis_Dragon" title="wikilink">Dennis Dragon</a> (#701) into a <a href="Double-decker_bus" title="wikilink">double-decker</a> trolleybus,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and it was tested on a 300-metre track in Wong Chuk Hang in that year.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Hong Kong decided not to build a trolleybus system, and the testing of this prototype did not lead to any further production of vehicles.</p>
<h2 id="use-and-preservation">Use and preservation</h2>
<p>There are currently around 340 cities or metropolitan areas where trolleybuses are operated,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and almost 500 additional trolleybus systems have existed in the past.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> For complete lists of trolleybus systems by location, with dates of opening and (where applicable) closure, see <a href="List_of_trolleybus_systems" title="wikilink">List of trolleybus systems</a> and the related lists indexed there.</p>
<p>The following are summary notes about current and past trolleybus operation in some countries. </p>
<h3 id="argentina">Argentina</h3>
<p>Trolleybuses are currently in use in <a href="Mendoza,_Argentina" title="wikilink">Mendoza</a>, <a href="Rosario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosario</a> and <a href="C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba,_Argentina" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00F3&gt;rdoba</a>.

<p>Trolleybus lines run in <a href="Yerevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yerevan</a>, Armenia.</p>
<h3 id="australia">Australia</h3>
<p>Australia has no remaining operating trolleybuses. Trolleybuses are preserved in the <a href="Brisbane_Tramway_Museum" title="wikilink">Brisbane Tramway Museum</a>, <a href="Sydney_Tramway_Museum" title="wikilink">Sydney Tramway Museum</a>, <a href="Powerhouse_Museum" title="wikilink">Powerhouse Museum</a> (Sydney), the Australian Electric Transport Museum at Adelaide (South Australia), the Perth Electric Tramway Society Museum, and at the Tasmanian Transport Museum in Hobart. Some of these trolleybuses are in operating condition, but there are no wired roadways to operate them on.</p>
<h3 id="austria">Austria</h3>
<p>The largest trolleybus system in Austria is in <a href="Salzburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salzburg</a>, with nine routes and 80 trolleybuses, operating from 0600 to midnight. The system was introduced in 1940 and has been expanded during recent years. <a href="Linz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Linz</a> has four routes and 19 vehicles: after years of uncertainty the continued existence of the system is guaranteed by the operator. The trolleybuses in <a href="Innsbruck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Innsbruck</a> went out of service in 2007 because of an expected expansion of the <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> system. A trolleybus system with two routes existed in <a href="Kapfenberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kapfenberg</a> until 2002. The towns of <a href="Klagenfurt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Klagenfurt</a> and <a href="Graz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Graz</a> closed their trolleybus systems in the 1960s.</p>

<p>The trolleybus system in <a href="Minsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minsk</a> (since 1952) is the second largest in the world. Trolleybuses also work in <a href="Brest_(Belarus)" title="wikilink">Brest</a>, <a href="Vitebsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitebsk</a>, <a href="Gomel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gomel</a>, <a href="Grodno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grodno</a>, <a href="Mogilev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mogilev</a> and <a href="Babruysk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babruysk</a> (since 1978).</p>
<h3 id="belgium">Belgium</h3>
<p>No trolleybus systems remain in operation in Belgium, but in the past, trolleybuses provided a portion of the local transport service in <a href="Antwerp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>, <a href="Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge</a> and <a href="Ghent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghent</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The last system, that of Ghent, which ceased operation in June 2009,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> had opened much later than all of the other Belgian trolleybus systems, in 1989. Government funds to build the Ghent system were provided, in part, for the purpose of improving the prospects for the export of Belgian-built trolleybuses,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and the Ghent system's fleet was made up entirely of trolleybuses built by <a href="Van_Hool" title="wikilink">Van Hool</a>, a Belgian company. The Brussels system comprised only a single route (the 54), in contrast to that city's large <a href="Brussels_trams" title="wikilink">tram</a> system. Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge had two independent trolleybus systems. One of them, a small system connecting Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge to the suburb of <a href="Seraing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seraing</a>, operated the world's only double-ended (bi-directional) trolleybuses; the vehicles were eventually rebuilt to conventional (single-ended) configuration.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> One of those unique vehicles, restored to double-ended configuration, is preserved at the <em>Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e des Transports en commun du Pays de Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Trolleybuses from the other Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge system and from Brussels and Ghent are preserved at various museums, including 1932-built Li&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge 425 at the <a href="The_Trolleybus_Museum_at_Sandtoft" title="wikilink">Sandtoft museum</a>, in England.</p>

Another forty trolleybuses leased from Edmonton continued operation in Toronto until the lease expired and the buses were returned to Edmonton in July 1993. Most of Canada's other trolleybus systems were abandoned during the 1960s and 1970s; the last two to disappear at that time (Saskatoon and Calgary) closed down in 1974 and 1975, respectively.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
