<p>The <strong>1941 Atlantic hurricane season</strong> was the period during 1941 in which tropical cyclones formed in the <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic Basin</a>. It was a relatively inactive <a href="Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">hurricane season</a>, with only six known storms. It officially began on June 16, 1941 and lasted until November 1, 1941.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These dates delimit the period of each year when most <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> tend to form in the <a href="Atlantic_basin" title="wikilink">Atlantic basin</a>. Of the six cyclones, four attained hurricane status, and two became major hurricanes. The season had an abnormally late start; the first system formed on September 11, nearly two months after the official beginning date. The season was also short-lived, as all six storms developed in rapid succession. On September 23, three hurricanes existed simultaneously in the Atlantic basin.</p>
<p>In total, the season resulted in about 63 fatalities and over $10 million in damages.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The first and last storms of the season were largely insignificant, although the second, fourth, and fifth storms had considerable effects. One hurricane struck <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> and <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> in late September, disrupting the <a href="Louisiana_Maneuvers" title="wikilink">Louisiana Maneuvers</a>. Among the most significant storms to impact the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> was <a href="1941_Florida_hurricane" title="wikilink">Hurricane Five</a>, which made landfall in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> at Category 3 intensity, inflicting widespread damage. Another major storm&lt;U+2014&gt;Hurricane Four&lt;U+2014&gt;traversed the Caribbean, leaving 47 men dead at sea. __TOC__ </p>

<h3 id="tropical-storm-one">Tropical Storm One</h3>

<p>The first storm of the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the northern <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a>. This was an abnormally late start to an Atlantic hurricane season: only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The storm moved slowly in a generally westward direction for the next few days, peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). It made landfall along the northern <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> coast between <a href="Galveston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Galveston</a> and <a href="Port_Arthur,_Texas" title="wikilink">Port Arthur</a> where it caused only minor damage.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Near 0000 UTC on September 16, the storm deteriorated into a depression, and dissipated a few hours later.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="hurricane-two">Hurricane Two</h3>


<p>Tropical Storm Two formed off the western coast of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> on September 16 and began moving west-southwest.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Operationally, the cyclone was first observed on September 18, to the south of <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>. After intensifying to a Category 1 hurricane, the storm began drifting southward towards the <a href="Yucatan_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucatan Peninsula</a>, ultimately executing a clockwise loop. By September 21 it had turned northward before assuming a more northwestward course. It moved across the western Gulf of Mexico and went ashore in <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> on September 23. It curved towards the northeast, passing just east of <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston</a>, and accelerated as it continued to move inland. The cyclone transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_storm" title="wikilink">extratropical storm</a> on September 24, and was last recorded in southern <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Warnings and advisories declared in response to the storm were widely distributed, and approximately 25,000 people in the area evacuated their homes.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Officials completed various precautionary measures.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Wind gusts along the coast reached up to ,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and high <a href="storm_tides" title="wikilink">storm tides</a> were recorded.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The hurricane inflicted severe damage; destruction to property was worth an estimated $2 million, with an additional $5 million in damage to crops, notably rice and cotton. Overall, the cyclone killed four people.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the <a href="Louisiana_Maneuvers" title="wikilink">Louisiana Maneuvers</a>, a prelude to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Heavy rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The inclement weather forced hundreds of military aircraft to move inland for shelter.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="hurricane-three">Hurricane Three</h3>

<p>Early on September 18, squally weather was reported throughout the Atlantic coast of Florida, with indications that a circulation center was present  offshore.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is estimated that a tropical storm had formed at around this time.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The cyclone began to intensity as it briefly moved northeastward, before abruptly executing an eastward turn. It attained Category 1 hurricane status on September 19, and completed a clockwise loop the next day. It then tracked northwestward toward <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, but began to recurve away from land late on October 22. It weakened into a tropical storm shortly afterward. The system dissipated on September 25 to the south of <a href="Nova_Scotia" title="wikilink">Nova Scotia</a>. The storm had little or no effect on land, but caused significant delays for North Atlantic shipping. One vessel en route from <a href="Cura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ao</a> to <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> encountered the storm on two separate occasions, recording Force 8 winds on the <a href="Beaufort_scale" title="wikilink">Beaufort scale</a> both times.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="hurricane-four">Hurricane Four</h3>

<p>On September 23, a minor area of disturbed weather was observed about  to the northwest of <a href="Barbados" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbados</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is estimated that it developed into a tropical storm shortly thereafter.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Tracking westward, it passed just south of <a href="St._Lucia" title="wikilink">St. Lucia</a> and emerged into the <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a>. By September 25, the storm had reached hurricane strength.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Still intensifying, the storm continued generally westward and reached its peak at Category 3 on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> By September 27, the hurricane was situated near <a href="Cape_Gracias_a_Dios" title="wikilink">Cape Gracias a Dios</a>, <a href="Honduras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honduras</a>, and accelerated as it moved across the northernmost stretch of the country. After briefly entering the <a href="Gulf_of_Honduras" title="wikilink">Gulf of Honduras</a>, it moved ashore again in the country, about  south of <a href="Belize" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belize</a>. Gradually weakening, the storm continued inland and weakened to a tropical storm by September 29. The storm emerged over the <a href="Bay_of_Campeche" title="wikilink">Bay of Campeche</a> as a tropical depression and made a final landfall on <a href="Veracruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Approximately 47 lives were lost at sea due to the hurricane. The <em>SS Ethel Sakel</em> displayed a &quot;sinking&quot; message on September 25, about  north of <a href="Aruba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aruba</a>; she later went down with 20 of her 33 crew members. Two other ships sent out distress signals, one of which capsized, all hands lost. Damage on land was also extensive, and three people drowned at Cape Gracias, which was largely destroyed by the storm. Coastal flooding in the town was severe.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In Belize, forests sustained major damage. For example, in the Melinda region, high winds brought down about about 10% of the large pines.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="hurricane-five">Hurricane Five</h3>


<p>Tropical Storm Five was first observed to the north of the <a href="Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Virgin Islands</a> on October 3. The storm tracked generally westward through The Bahamas, reaching peak winds of , which corresponds to a Category 3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving across southern Florida the hurricane emerged into the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> and made another <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> along the <a href="Florida_Panhandle" title="wikilink">Florida Panhandle</a>. Turning toward the north and northeast, it crossed <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> and <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>, and entered the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> on October 8. The storm fully dissipated several days later.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Preparations for the storm were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of <a href="Nassau,_Bahamas" title="wikilink">Nassau</a> was struck particularly hard. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and powerlines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. Storm surge in the <a href="Everglades" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everglades</a> region flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of <a href="Tallahassee,_Florida" title="wikilink">Tallahassee</a> suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 (1941 USD) in damages. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="tropical-storm-six">Tropical Storm Six</h3>

<p>A tropical storm formed on October 15, and passed through the southern <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>. It crossed the <a href="Florida_Straits" title="wikilink">Florida Straits</a>, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 20, after entering the eastern Gulf of Mexico and turning towards the north.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It curved northeastward and made landfall at <a href="Cedar_Key,_Florida" title="wikilink">Cedar Key, Florida</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> After pushing inland, the storm stalled and weakened to a tropical depression on October 21 before dissipating fully the next day.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The storm's slow forward motion over the state of Florida led to heavy widespread precipitation, locally amounting to . Gale-force winds were also reported. Some flood damage occurred throughout the affected locations.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> An infant was killed following the destruction of a house, possibly related to a <a href="tornado" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornado</a> spawned by the tropical storm; the baby's parents also sustained injuries.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> </p>
