<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>All eleven members of the 1890 All-America team played for three teams -- Harvard, Princeton or Yale, then known as the &quot;Big Three&quot; of college football. Some sources indicate that <a href="Walter_Camp" title="wikilink">Walter Camp</a> assisted Whitney with the selection of the 1890 All-American team, while others indicate that Camp did not become involved in the selection process until some time in the early 1890s. <img src="Lee_McClung_sig.jpg" title="fig:&quot;Bum&quot; McClung&#39;s signature as used on U.S. currency" alt="&quot;Bum&quot; McClung&#39;s signature as used on U.S. currency" /> <img src="Marshall_Newell.jpg" title="fig:Harvard tackle &quot;Ma&quot; Newell was run over by a railroad engine on Christmas Eve 1897." alt="Harvard tackle &quot;Ma&quot; Newell was run over by a railroad engine on Christmas Eve 1897." width="175" /> <img src="Nose_Armor.jpg" title="fig:Football&#39;s first protective face gear, &quot;nose armor,&quot; was devleoped to protect Harvard&#39;s John Corbett." alt="Football&#39;s first protective face gear, &quot;nose armor,&quot; was devleoped to protect Harvard&#39;s John Corbett." width="175" /> The 1890 All-America team included three players who were later inducted into the <a href="College_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">College Football Hall of Fame</a>: Harvard's great tackle <a href="Marshall_Newell" title="wikilink">Marshall &quot;Ma&quot; Newell</a>, Yale's guard <a href="William_Heffelfinger" title="wikilink">William &quot;Pudge&quot; Heffelfinger</a>, and Yale's halfback <a href="Thomas_McClung" title="wikilink">Thomas &quot;Bum&quot; McClung</a>.</p>
<p>The strength of the 1890 team is demonstrated by the fact that a majority of the players selected (seven of eleven) were selected as All-Americans in multiple years. They are: Pudge Heffelfinger (1889, 1890 and 1891), John Corbett (1889 and 1890), Marshall Newell (1890 and 1891), <a href="Frank_Hallowell" title="wikilink">Frank Hallowell</a> (1890 and 1892), <a href="Jesse_Riggs" title="wikilink">Jesse Riggs</a> (1890 and 1891), &quot;Bum&quot; McClung (1890 and 1891), and<a href="Sheppard_Homans" title="wikilink">Sheppard Homans</a> (1890 and 1891).</p>
<p>The team included men who went on to great success in their careers. McClung went on to become the <a href="Treasurer_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Treasurer of the United States</a> under U.S. President <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a>, and his signature appears on U.S. currency issued during the years 1909-1912. Heffelfinger became the first &quot;professional&quot; football player in 1892 when he was paid $25 for his expenses and a bonus of $500 by the <a href="Allegheny_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">Allegheny Athletic Association</a> to play in a game against the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Harvard's quarterback <a href="Dudley_Dean" title="wikilink">Dudley Dean</a> enlisted in <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Teddy Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="Rough_Riders" title="wikilink">Rough Riders</a> and was decorated for his role in the Battle of San Juan Hill.</p>
<p>The team also included players who met with tragic endings. Newell was killed on Christmas Eve 1897 when a railroad engine accidentally backed up over him. Princeton's end <a href="Ralph_Warren" title="wikilink">Ralph Warren</a> suffered a severely twisted neck in the 1891 Princeton-Yale game and wandered off several weeks later, having reportedly suffered a mental breakdown as a combined result of the injury and despondency over the loss to Yale.</p>
<p>Football in 1890 was a brutal sport, played before the introduction of helmets and other protective gear. Serious injuries and even deaths were common occurrences in the game. Harvard's All-American center, <a href="John_Cranston_(American_football)" title="wikilink">John Cranston</a>, was the first player to wear equipment to protect his face during an <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> game. In order to protect Cranston's &quot;weak nose,&quot; Harvard captain and <a href="1889_College_Football_All-America_Team" title="wikilink">1889 All-American</a> <a href="Arthur_Cumnock" title="wikilink">Arthur Cumnock</a> invented a device that he called &quot;nose armor.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Cumnock's invention gained popularity, and in 1892, a newspaper article described the growing popularity of the device:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By the invention of nose armor football players who have been hitherto barred from the field because of broken or weak noses are now able to thrust an armor protected nose (even though it be broken) into the center of the roughest scrimmage without danger to the sensitive nasal organ. The armor is made of fine rubbber and protects both the nose and teeth.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1952, <a href="Grantland_Rice" title="wikilink">Grantland Rice</a> paid tribute to Princeton's fullback <a href="Sheppard_Homans" title="wikilink">Sheppard Homans</a> as the embodiment of the rough and tumble days of iron man football. Rice wrote: &quot;Just as <a href="Ty_Cobb" title="wikilink">Ty Cobb</a> represents the ball game of many years ago, this man represented the football that used to be.&quot;</p>
