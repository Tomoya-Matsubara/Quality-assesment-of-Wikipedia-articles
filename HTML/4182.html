<p><strong>Scandinavian Scotland</strong> refers to the period from the 8th to the 15th centuries during which <a href="Viking" title="wikilink">Vikings</a>, <a href="Norsemen" title="wikilink">Norse</a> settlers and their descendents colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland. Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and hostility between the Scandinavian <a href="Earl_of_Orkney" title="wikilink">Earls of Orkney</a> and the emerging <a href="thalassocracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">thalassocracy</a> of the <a href="Kingdom_of_the_Isles" title="wikilink">Kingdom of the Isles</a>, and the rulers of Ireland, <a href="D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_Riata" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata</a> and <a href="Alba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alba</a>, and intervention by the crown of <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> were recurring themes.</p>
<p>Scandinavian-held territories included the <a href="Northern_Isles" title="wikilink">Northern Isles</a> of <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shetland</a>, the <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a>, the <a href="Islands_of_the_Clyde" title="wikilink">islands of the Firth of Clyde</a>, the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a> and associated mainland territories including <a href="Caithness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caithness</a> and <a href="Sutherland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sutherland</a>. The historical record is weak and the Irish annals and the later Norse sagas, of which the <em><a href="Orkneyinga_Saga" title="wikilink">Orkneyinga Saga</a></em> is the principal source of information, are sometimes contradictory although modern <a href="archaeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeology</a> is beginning to provide a broader picture of life during this period.</p>
<p>There are various competing theories that have addressed the early colonisation process although it is clear that the Northern Isles were the first to be conquered by Vikings and the last to be relinquished by the Norwegian crown. <a href="Thorfinn_the_Mighty" title="wikilink">Thorfinn Sigurdsson</a>'s rule in the 11th century included expansion well into north mainland Scotland and this may have been the zenith of Scandinavian influence. The obliteration of pre-Norse names in the Hebrides and their replacement with Norse ones was almost total although the emergence of alliances with the native <a href="Scottish_Gaelic" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> speakers produced a powerful <a href="Norse-Gael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norse-Gael</a> culture that had wide influence in <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a>, <a href="Galloway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galloway</a> and beyond.</p>
<p>Scottish influence increased from the 13th century on. In 1231 an unbroken line of Norse earls of Orkney ended and the title was henceforward held by Scots nobles. An ill-fated expedition by <a href="Haakon_IV_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Haakon Haakonarson</a> later in that century led to the relinquishing of the islands of the west to the Scottish Crown and in the mid-15th century Orkney and Shetland were also transferred to Scottish rule.</p>
<p>The negative view of Viking activities held in popular imagination notwithstanding,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Norse expansion may have been a motive factor in the emergence of the Gaelic kingdom of Alba, the forerunner of modern Scotland, and the trading, political, cultural and religious achievements of the later periods of Norse rule were significant.</p>

<h2 id="colonisation-process">Colonisation process</h2>
<p>Scholarly interpretations of the period &quot;have led to widely divergent reconstructions of Viking Age Scotland&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> especially in the early period and Barrett (2008) has identified four competing theories, none of which he regards as proven.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <img src="Scarba_and_The_Strait_of_Coryvreckan_-_geograph.org.uk_-_20844.jpg" title="fig:The Gulf of Corryvreckan between Jura and Scarba. According to tradition &quot;Prince Breacan of Lochlann&quot; was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships." alt="The Gulf of Corryvreckan between Jura and Scarba. According to tradition &quot;Prince Breacan of Lochlann&quot; was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships." /> The traditional explanation is the earldom hypothesis. This assumes a period of Norse expansion into the Northern Isles and the creation of an aristocratic dynasty that lasted well into the Medieval period, which exerted considerable influence in western Scotland and Mann into the 11th century. This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and as noted above is supported by some archaeological evidence although it has been criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the <em>Su&lt;U+00F0&gt;reyar</em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The second of these theories is the <a href="genocide" class="uri" title="wikilink">genocide</a> hypothesis, which asserts that the aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin throughout much of the region.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The pagan reaction hypothesis proposed by Bjorn Mhyre suggests a long tradition of mobility amongst the various populations of the North Atlantic seaboard and that the expansion of Christian missions resulted in ethnic tensions that led to or exacerbated <a href="Viking_expansion" title="wikilink">Viking expansion</a>. There is some evidence of such mobility, such as Irish missionary activities in <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a> and <a href="Faroe_Islands" title="wikilink">The Faroes</a> in the 8th century, but little that is conclusive.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The fourth suggestion is the <em><a href="Lochlann" title="wikilink">Laithlind</a></em> or Lochlann hypothesis. This word appears in various forms in the early Irish literature and is usually assumed to refer to Norway itself, although some have preferred to locate it in the Norse-dominated parts of Scotland.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <a href="Donnchadh_&lt;U+00D3&gt;_Corr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in" title="wikilink">Donnchadh &lt;U+00D3&gt; Corr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in</a> is a proponent of this view and claims that that a substantial part of Scotland&lt;U+2014&gt;the Northern and Western Isles and large areas of the coastal mainland&lt;U+2014&gt;were conquered by the Vikings in the first quarter of the 9th century and that a Viking kingdom was set up there earlier than the middle of the century.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Essentially a variant of the earldom hypothesis, there is little archaeological evidence in its favour,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> although it is clear that extensive Viking incursions on the Irish coasts were supported by a presence of some kind in the <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a>, even if the date the latter became prominent is far from certain.{{#tag:ref|Barret (2008) suggest a &quot;late, mid-ninth-century&quot; date for Viking settlement and raids &quot;launched from bases in Atlantic Scotland&quot; but notes a variety of other options suggested by scholars.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} As &lt;U+00D3&gt; Corr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in himself admits &quot;when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>The first phase of Norse expansion was that of war bands seeking plunder and the creation of new settlements.

<p>The Viking invasions may have inadvertently played a role in the creation of modern Scotland.

This may be a reflection of the less well documented nature of the various invasions involved, but it also hints at a relative lack of popular understanding of the history. By comparison to the <a href="Scotland_during_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman occupations of Scotland</a> the Norse kingdoms were much longer lived, more recent and had a significantly more dramatic influence on spoken language and by extension culture and lifestyles generally. They were however confined to areas that are relatively remote from the main centres of modern population. Furthermore, regardless of the actual impact of Scandinavian culture, the hereditary leaders of the Scots nation are generally descended from Pictish, Gaelic and Anglo-Saxon stock.
