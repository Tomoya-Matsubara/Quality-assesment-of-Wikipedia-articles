<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The road from New Brunswick to Trenton was built in the 19th century as the <a href="Trenton_and_New_Brunswick_Turnpike" title="wikilink">Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike</a>, commonly called the Straight Turnpike due to its complete lack of curves. The road eventually fell into disrepair in favor of the older road via <a href="Princeton,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Princeton</a>, which became part of the <a href="Lincoln_Highway" title="wikilink">Lincoln Highway</a> in 1913 and <a href="pre-1927_Route_13_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">pre-1927 Route 13</a> in 1916.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1926, the turnpike was legislated into the state highway system as an unnumbered route. It received its number, Route 26, in the <a href="1927_renumbering" title="wikilink">1927 renumbering</a>, and was reconstructed by the state. Except for the bridge over the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> (now <a href="Amtrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>'s <a href="Northeast_Corridor" title="wikilink">Northeast Corridor</a>) in North Brunswick, the road was completed by early 1929.</p>
<p>The road was taken over by the state from the New Brunswick city line at Nassau Street to <a href="Brunswick_Circle" title="wikilink">Brunswick Circle</a> near Trenton. A short piece of the turnpike southwest of Brunswick Circle to the Trenton city line at Spruce Street had been taken over ca. 1920 as part of <a href="pre-1927_Route_13_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">pre-1927 Route 13</a>. Inside New Brunswick, the old turnpike (Livingston Avenue) was <strong>County Route 3R16</strong>, but was signed as part of Route 26 to its end at <a href="Route_S28_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route S28</a> (<a href="George_Street_(New_Brunswick)" title="wikilink">George Street</a>). A spur along Jersey Avenue, which was taken over as <a href="Route_26A_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 26A</a>, provided direct access to <a href="New_Jersey_Route_27" title="wikilink">Route 27</a> in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Most of the <a href="Calhoun_Street_Extension" title="wikilink">Calhoun Street Extension</a> from Brunswick Circle to the <a href="Calhoun_Street_Bridge" title="wikilink">Calhoun Street Bridge</a> in Trenton was taken over ca. 1932, but nothing indicates it was part of Route 26. It provided an alternate route into Pennsylvania, bypassing downtown Trenton. The <a href="Trenton_Freeway" title="wikilink">Trenton Freeway</a>, opened ca. 1953, was built as an extension of Route 26, running from Brunswick Circle through downtown into Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In the <a href="1953_renumbering" title="wikilink">1953 renumbering</a>, Route 26 was truncated to run only in the New Brunswick area, as the rest was part of <a href="U.S._Route_1_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 1</a>.</p>

<p>There were two routes related to Route 26. The first was <strong><a href="Route_26A_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 26A</a></strong>, a spur into <a href="New_Brunswick_(NJ)" title="wikilink">New Brunswick</a> on the west side of the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>. Route 26A is now numbered as <a href="Route_91_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 91</a>. The second route, <strong>Route S26</strong>, was also defined in the <a href="1927_renumbering" title="wikilink">1927 renumbering</a> as a short spur of Route 26, running from just north of the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> overpass in North Brunswick east to the junction of <a href="Route_25_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 25</a> and <a href="Route_25M_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 25M</a>, now the junction of <a href="U.S._Route_1_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 1</a>, <a href="U.S._Route_130" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 130</a> and <a href="Route_171_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Route 171</a>. It opened ca. 1929, and became part of U.S. Route 1 in the <a href="1953_renumbering" title="wikilink">1953 renumbering</a>.</p>
