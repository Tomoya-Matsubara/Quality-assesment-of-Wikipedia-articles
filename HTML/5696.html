<p><strong>Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard</strong> (; May 28, 1818 – February 20, 1893) was a <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>-born American military officer, politician, inventor, writer, civil servant, and the first prominent <a href="General_officer" title="wikilink">general</a> of the <a href="Confederate_States_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate States Army</a> during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>. Today he is commonly referred to as <strong>P. G. T. Beauregard</strong>, but he rarely used his first name as an adult. He signed correspondence as <strong>G. T. Beauregard</strong>.</p>
<p>Trained as a civil engineer at the <a href="United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Military Academy</a>, Beauregard served with distinction as an engineer in the <a href="Mexican-American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican-American War</a>. Following a brief appointment at West Point in 1861, after the South seceded he resigned from the US Army and became the first Confederate <a href="Brigadier_General_(CSA)" title="wikilink">brigadier general</a>. He commanded the defenses of <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, at the start of the Civil War at <a href="Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="wikilink">Fort Sumter</a> on April 12, 1861. Three months later he won the <a href="First_Battle_of_Bull_Run" title="wikilink">First Battle of Bull Run</a> near <a href="Manassas,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Manassas, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>Beauregard commanded armies in the <a href="Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Western Theater</a>, including at the <a href="Battle_of_Shiloh" title="wikilink">Battle of Shiloh</a> in <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>, and the <a href="Siege_of_Corinth" title="wikilink">Siege of Corinth</a> in northern <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>. He returned to Charleston and defended it in 1863 from repeated naval and land attacks by Union forces. His greatest achievement was saving the important industrial city of <a href="Petersburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Petersburg, Virginia</a> in June 1864, and thus the nearby Confederate capital of <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond</a>, from assaults by overwhelmingly superior <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a> forces.</p>
<p>But, his influence over Confederate strategy was lessened by his poor professional relationships with <a href="President_of_the_Confederate_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Jefferson_Davis" title="wikilink">Jefferson Davis</a> and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General <a href="Joseph_E._Johnston" title="wikilink">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, convinced Davis and the remaining cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered most of the remaining armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Maj. Gen. <a href="William_T._Sherman" title="wikilink">William T. Sherman</a>.</p>
<p>Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a> executive. He became wealthy because of his role in promoting the <a href="Louisiana_State_Lottery_Company" title="wikilink">Louisiana Lottery</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Beauregard was born at the &quot;Contreras&quot; sugar-cane <a href="plantation" class="uri" title="wikilink">plantation</a> in <a href="St._Bernard_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">St. Bernard Parish</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, about  outside <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, to a <a href="Louisiana_Creole_people" title="wikilink">French Creole</a> family. Beauregard was the third child of H&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Judith de Reggio, a descendant of an Italian <a href="noble_family" title="wikilink">noble family</a> who had migrated to France and then to Louisiana, and her husband, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard, of French and Welsh ancestry.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He had three brothers and three sisters. Beauregard attended New Orleans private schools and then went to a &quot;French school&quot; in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. During his four years in New York, beginning at age 12, he first learned to speak English, as French had been his first language in Louisiana.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>He was educated at the <a href="United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West_Point,_New_York" title="wikilink">West Point, New York</a>. One of his instructors was <a href="Robert_Anderson_(major)" title="wikilink">Robert Anderson</a>, who later became the commander of <a href="Fort_Sumter" title="wikilink">Fort Sumter</a> and surrendered to Beauregard at the start of the Civil War. Upon enrolling at West Point, Beauregard dropped the hyphen from his surname and treated Toutant as a middle name, to fit in with his classmates. From that point on, he rarely used his first name, preferring &quot;G. T. Beauregard.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He graduated second in his class in 1838 and excelled both as an <a href="artillery" title="wikilink">artilleryman</a> and <a href="military_engineer" title="wikilink">military engineer</a>. His Army friends gave him many nicknames: &quot;Little Creole&quot;, &quot;Bory&quot;, &quot;Little Frenchman&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, and &quot;Little <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="career-in-u.s.-army">Career in U.S. Army</h2>
<p>During the <a href="Mexican-American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican-American War</a>, Beauregard served as an engineer under General <a href="Winfield_Scott" title="wikilink">Winfield Scott</a>. He was appointed <a href="brevet_(military)" title="wikilink">brevet</a> <a href="Captain_(U.S._Army)" title="wikilink">captain</a> for the battles of <a href="Battle_of_Contreras" title="wikilink">Contreras</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Churubusco" title="wikilink">Churubusco</a> and <a href="Major_(United_States)" title="wikilink">major</a> for <a href="Battle_of_Chapultepec" title="wikilink">Chapultepec</a>, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance in a meeting with Scott in which he swayed the opinions of the general officers assembled to change their planned tactics for attacking the fortress of Chapultepec. He was one of the first officers to enter <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a>. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain <a href="Robert_E._Lee" title="wikilink">Robert E. Lee</a>, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers received more brevets than he did.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard returned from Mexico in 1848. For the next 12 years, he was in charge of what the Engineer Department called &quot;the Mississippi and Lake defenses in Louisiana.&quot; Much of his engineering work was done elsewhere, repairing old forts and building new ones on the <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> coast and in <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a>. He also improved the defenses of <a href="Battle_of_Forts_Jackson_and_St._Philip" title="wikilink">Forts St. Philip and Jackson</a> on the Mississippi River below New Orleans. He worked on a board of Army and Navy engineers to improve the navigation of the shipping channels at the mouth of the Mississippi. He created and patented an invention he called a &quot;self-acting bar excavator&quot; to be used by ships in crossing bars of sand and clay. While still in the Army, he actively campaigned for the election of <a href="Franklin_Pierce" title="wikilink">Franklin Pierce</a>, the Democratic presidential candidate in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1852" title="wikilink">1852</a>, and a former general in the Mexican War who had been impressed by Beauregard's performance at Mexico City. Pierce appointed Beauregard as superintending engineer of the New Orleans Federal <a href="customhouse" title="wikilink">customs house</a>, a huge granite building that had been built in 1848. As it was sinking unevenly in the moist soil of Louisiana, Beauregard had to develop a renovation program. He served in this position from 1853 to 1860 and was able to stabilize the structure successfully.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>During his service in New Orleans, Beauregard became dissatisfied as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 that he was going to join the <a href="filibuster_(military)" title="wikilink">filibuster</a> with <a href="William_Walker_(filibuster)" title="wikilink">William Walker</a>, who had seized control of <a href="Nicaragua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a>; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the US. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for <a href="mayor_of_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">mayor of New Orleans</a> in 1858, where he was promoted by both the <a href="Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Whig</a> and <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> parties to challenge the <a href="Know_Nothing" title="wikilink">Know Nothing</a> party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Employing the political influence of his brother-in-law, <a href="John_Slidell" title="wikilink">John Slidell</a>, Beauregard obtained an appointment as <a href="Superintendents_of_the_United_States_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">superintendent</a> of the U.S. Military Academy on January 23, 1861. His orders were revoked and he relinquished the office after only five days when <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> <a href="secession" title="wikilink">seceded</a> from the <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a>. He protested to the War Department that they had cast &quot;improper reflection upon [his] reputation or position in the Corps of Engineers&quot; by forcing him out as a Southern officer before any hostilities began.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>

Marie's paternal grandfather was <a href="Jacques_Viller&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Jacques Viller&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, the second <a href="governor_of_Louisiana" title="wikilink">governor of Louisiana</a>. She was described as having blue eyes and fair skin.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The couple had three children: Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; (1843–1910), Henri (1845–1915), and Laure (1850–1884). Marie died in March 1850, while giving birth to Laure.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Ten years later, the widower Beauregard married Caroline Deslonde, the daughter of Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Deslonde, a sugar cane planter from <a href="St._James_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">St. James Parish</a>. Caroline was a sister-in-law of <a href="John_Slidell" title="wikilink">John Slidell</a>, a <a href="U.S._Senator" title="wikilink">U.S. senator</a> from Louisiana and later a Confederate <a href="diplomat" class="uri" title="wikilink">diplomat</a>. She died in New Orleans in March 1864, when it was under Union occupation. They had no children together.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="civil-war">Civil War</h2>
<h3 id="charleston">Charleston</h3>

<p><img src="PGTBeauregard01.jpg" title="fig:Confederate General P. Gustave Toutant Beauregard" alt="Confederate General P. Gustave Toutant Beauregard" /> Beauregard traveled by steamship from New York to New Orleans and immediately began giving military advice to the local authorities, which included further strengthening Forts St. Philip and Jackson, which guarded the Mississippi approaches to New Orleans. He hoped to be named commander of the state army, but was disappointed that the state legislature appointed <a href="Braxton_Bragg" title="wikilink">Braxton Bragg</a>. Aware that Beauregard might resent him, Bragg offered the officer the rank of colonel. Instead Beauregard enrolled as a private in the &quot;Orleans Guards&quot;, a battalion of French Creole aristocrats. At the same time, he communicated with Slidell and the newly chosen President Davis, angling for a senior position in the new Confederate States Army. Rumors that Beauregard would be placed in charge of the entire Army infuriated Bragg. Concerned about the political situation regarding the Federal presence at Fort Sumter in <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston</a> Harbor, Davis selected Beauregard to take command of Charleston's defenses. Beauregard seemed the perfect combination of military engineer and charismatic Southern leader needed at that time and place.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard became the first Confederate <a href="general_officer" title="wikilink">general officer</a>, appointed a <a href="Brigadier_General_(CSA)" title="wikilink">brigadier general</a> in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States on March 1, 1861.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> (He was promoted on July 21 to be one of the eventual seven <a href="History_of_Confederate_States_Army_Generals#General_(Full_general)" title="wikilink">full generals</a> in the Confederate Army; his date of rank made him the fifth most senior general, behind <a href="Samuel_Cooper_(general)" title="wikilink">Samuel Cooper</a>, <a href="Albert_Sidney_Johnston" title="wikilink">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>, <a href="Robert_E._Lee" title="wikilink">Robert E.

<p><img src="Bombardment_of_Fort_Sumter,_1861.png" title="fig:Bombardment of Fort Sumter, 1861. George Edward Perine (1837-1885), engraver." alt="Bombardment of Fort Sumter, 1861. George Edward Perine (1837-1885), engraver." /> Arriving in Charleston on March 3, 1861, Beauregard met with Governor <a href="Francis_Wilkinson_Pickens" title="wikilink">Pickens</a> and inspected the defenses of the harbor, which he found to be in disarray. He was said to display &quot;a great deal in the way of zeal and energy ... but little professional knowledge and experience.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Major Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter wrote to Washington, D.C., that Beauregard, who had been his student at West Point in 1837,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> would guarantee that South Carolina's actions be exercised with &quot;skill and sound judgment.&quot; Beauregard wrote to the first Confederate capital of <a href="Montgomery,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Montgomery</a>, <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a>, that Anderson was a &quot;most gallant officer&quot;. Beauregard did not relish firing on his old friend and former instructor. He sent several cases of fine brandy and whiskey and boxes of cigars to Anderson and his officers at Sumter, but Anderson ordered that the gifts be returned.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Political tensions mounted by early April and Beauregard demanded that Sumter surrender before a planned Union expedition to re-provision the fort could arrive. Early in the morning of April 12, negotiations with Anderson had failed and aides of Beauregard, sent to deal personally with Anderson, ordered the first shots of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> to be fired from nearby Fort Johnson. The <a href="Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="wikilink">bombardment of Fort Sumter</a> lasted for 34 hours. Subjected to thousands of rounds fired from batteries ringing the harbor, Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter on April 14. Biographer <a href="T._Harry_Williams" title="wikilink">T. Harry Williams</a> described the extravagant praise from throughout the Confederacy that &quot;The Hero of Fort Sumter&quot; received for his victory: &quot;He was the South's first <a href="paladin" class="uri" title="wikilink">paladin</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-bull-run-first-manassas">First Bull Run (First Manassas)</h3>
<p>Summoned to the new Confederate capital of <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond, Virginia</a>, Beauregard received a hero's welcome at the railroad stations along the route. He was given command of the &quot;Alexandria Line&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> of defenses against an impending Federal offensive that was being organized by Brig. Gen. <a href="Irvin_McDowell" title="wikilink">Irvin McDowell</a> (one of Beauregard's West Point classmates) against the Confederate railroad junction at <a href="Manassas,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Manassas</a>. Beauregard devised strategies to concentrate the forces of (full) General <a href="Joseph_E._Johnston" title="wikilink">Joseph E. Johnston</a> from the <a href="Shenandoah_Valley" title="wikilink">Shenandoah Valley</a> with his own, aiming not only to defend his position, but to initiate an offensive against McDowell and Washington. Despite his seniority in rank, Johnston lacked familiarity with the terrain and ceded tactical planning of the impending battle to Beauregard as a professional courtesy. President Davis considered many of Beauregard's plans to be impractical for an army as inexperienced as the Confederates could field in 1861; throughout the war, Davis and Beauregard would argue about Beauregard's tendencies to devise grand strategies based on formal military principles. Davis believed he lacked a pragmatic grasp of logistics, intelligence, relative military strengths, and politics.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="First_Bull_Run_July21am.png" title="fig:Start of the First Battle of Bull Run." alt="Start of the First Battle of Bull Run." /> The <a href="First_Battle_of_Bull_Run" title="wikilink">First Battle of Bull Run</a> (First Manassas) began early on July 21, 1861, with an element of surprise for both armies— both McDowell and Beauregard planned to envelop their opponent with an attack from their right flank.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> McDowell struck first, crossing <a href="Bull_Run_(Occoquan_River)" title="wikilink">Bull Run</a> and threatening Beauregard's left flank. For a while, Beauregard persisted in moving his troops for an attack on his right flank (McDowell's left, toward <a href="Centreville,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Centreville</a>), but Johnston urged him to travel with him to the threatened flank at <a href="Henry_House_Hill" title="wikilink">Henry House Hill</a>, which was weakly defended. Seeing the strength of the Union attack at that point, Beauregard insisted that Johnston leave the area of immediate action and coordinate the overall battle from a position  to the rear. Beauregard rallied the troops, riding among the men, brandishing regimental colors, and giving inspirational speeches. The Confederate line held.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>As Johnston's final troops arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, the Confederates launched a counterattack that routed the Union Army, sending it streaming in disorder back toward Washington. <a href="William_C._Davis_(historian)" title="wikilink">William C. Davis</a> credits Johnston with the majority of the tactical decisions that led to the victory, judging that &quot;Beauregard acted chiefly as a dime novel general, leading the charge of an individual regiment, riding along the line to cheer the troops, accepting the huzzas of the soldiers and complementing them in turn. The closest he came to a major tactical decision was his fleeting intention to withdraw from the Henry Hill line when he briefly mistook [the advance of Johnston's reinforcements for the arrival of fresh Union troops].&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Nonetheless, Beauregard received the bulk of the acclaim from the press and general public. On July 23, Johnston recommended to President Davis that Beauregard be promoted to full general. Davis approved, and Beauregard's date of rank was established as the date of his victory, July 21.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Battle_flag_of_the_US_Confederacy.svg" title="fig:Beauregard&#39;s Battle Flag" alt="Beauregard&#39;s Battle Flag" /> After Bull Run, Beauregard advocated the use of a standardized battle flag other than the <a href="Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">&quot;Stars and Bars&quot;</a> Confederate national flag to avoid visual confusion with the <a href="U.S._flag" title="wikilink">U.S. flag</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He worked with Johnston and <a href="William_Porcher_Miles" title="wikilink">William Porcher Miles</a> to create the <a href="Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate Battle Flag</a>. Confederate ladies visiting Beauregard's army contributed silk material from their dresses to create the first three flags, for Beauregard, Johnston, and <a href="Earl_Van_Dorn" title="wikilink">Earl Van Dorn</a>; thus, the first flags contained more feminine pink than martial red.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Throughout his career, Beauregard worked to have the flag adopted, and he helped to make it the most popular symbol of the Confederacy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>As the Army went into winter quarters, Beauregard caused considerable friction with the Confederate high command. He strongly advocated an invasion of <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> to threaten the flank and rear of Washington. With his plan rebuffed as impractical, he requested reassignment to New Orleans, which he assumed would be under Union attack in the near future, but his request was denied. He quarreled with Commissary General <a href="Lucius_B._Northrop" title="wikilink">Lucius B. Northrop</a> (a personal friend of Davis) about the inadequate supplies available to his army. He issued public statements challenging the ability of the Confederate <a href="Confederate_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a> to give commands to a full general. And he enraged President Davis when his report about Bull Run was printed in the newspaper, which suggested that Davis's interference with Beauregard's plans prevented the pursuit and full destruction of McDowell's army and the capture of Washington.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="shiloh-and-corinth">Shiloh and Corinth</h3>
<p><img src="Shiloh_Battle_Apr6pm.png" title="fig:Map of the Battle of Shiloh, afternoon of April 6, 1862, after Beauregard took command." alt="Map of the Battle of Shiloh, afternoon of April 6, 1862, after Beauregard took command." /> Having become a political liability in Virginia, Beauregard was transferred to <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a> to become second-in-command to General <a href="Albert_Sidney_Johnston" title="wikilink">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> (no relation to Joseph E. Johnston) in his <a href="Army_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Army of Mississippi</a>, effective March 14, 1862. The two generals planned the concentration of Confederate forces to oppose the advance of Maj. Gen. <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a> before he could combine his army with that of Maj. Gen. <a href="Don_Carlos_Buell" title="wikilink">Don Carlos Buell</a> in a thrust up the <a href="Tennessee_River" title="wikilink">Tennessee River</a> toward <a href="Corinth,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Corinth, Mississippi</a>. In the <a href="Battle_of_Shiloh" title="wikilink">Battle of Shiloh</a>, which began April 6, 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack against Grant's <a href="Army_of_the_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Army of the Tennessee</a> and nearly defeated it. Once again a more senior general named Johnston deferred to the junior Beauregard in planning the attack. The massive frontal assault was marred by Beauregard's improper organization of forces—successive attacks by corps in lines  long, rather than assigning each corps a discrete portion of the line for a side-by-side assault. This arrangement caused intermingling of units and confusion of command; it failed to concentrate mass at the appropriate place on the line to affect the overall objectives of the attack. In midafternoon, Johnston, who was near the front of the battle action, was mortally wounded. Beauregard, positioned in the rear of the army to send reinforcements forward, assumed command of the army and Johnston's overall Western department (officially designated &quot;Department Number Two&quot;). As darkness fell, he chose to call off the attack against Grant's final defensive line, which had contracted into a tight semicircle backed up to the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard's decision was one of the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's <a href="Army_of_the_Ohio" title="wikilink">Army of the Ohio</a> began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Grant was temporarily disgraced by the surprise attack and near defeat, causing his superior, Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry_W._Halleck" title="wikilink">Henry W. Halleck</a>, to assume field command of the combined armies. Halleck cautiously and slowly approached Beauregard's fortifications at Corinth; his action became derisively called the <a href="Siege_of_Corinth" title="wikilink">Siege of Corinth</a>. Beauregard withdrew from Corinth on May 29 to <a href="Tupelo,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Tupelo, Mississippi</a>. He was able to deceive Halleck into thinking the Confederates were about to attack; he ran empty trains back and forth through the town while whistles blew and troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving. Beauregard retreated because of the overwhelming Union force and because of contaminated water supplies in Corinth. In April and May, the Confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in Corinth as had been killed in battle at Shiloh. Nevertheless, his leaving the critical rail junction at Corinth without a fight was another controversial decision. When Beauregard went on medical leave without requesting permission in advance, President Davis relieved him of command and replaced him with Gen. <a href="Braxton_Bragg" title="wikilink">Braxton Bragg</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="return-to-charleston">Return to Charleston</h3>
<p>At Beauregard's request, his allies in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis remained angry at Beauregard's absence and told him he should have stayed at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, &quot;If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, and <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> replacing Maj. Gen. <a href="John_C._Pemberton" title="wikilink">John C. Pemberton</a>. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of <a href="Vicksburg,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard was unhappy with his new assignment, believing that he deserved command of one of the great Confederate field armies. He performed successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, <a href="Rear_admiral_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Samuel_Francis_Du_Pont" title="wikilink">Samuel Francis Du Pont</a>, commander of the <a href="Union_blockade" title="wikilink">South Atlantic Blockading Squadron</a>, led an <a href="ironclad_warship" title="wikilink">ironclad</a> attack against Fort Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from Beauregard's forces. In July through September 1863, land forces under Brig. Gen. <a href="Quincy_Adams_Gillmore" title="wikilink">Quincy A. Gillmore</a> launched a series of attacks on <a href="Second_Battle_of_Fort_Wagner" title="wikilink">Fort Wagner</a> on <a href="Morris_Island" title="wikilink">Morris Island</a> and other fortifications at the mouth of the harbor, while Rear Adm. <a href="John_A._Dahlgren" title="wikilink">John A. Dahlgren</a> attempted to destroy <a href="Second_Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="wikilink">Fort Sumter</a>. Because the latter operation failed, the successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening Charleston.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>During this period, Beauregard promoted innovative naval defense strategies, such as early experimentation with <a href="submarine" title="wikilink">submarines</a>, <a href="naval_mine" title="wikilink">naval mines</a> (called &quot;torpedoes&quot; in the Civil War), and with a small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A swift boat fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water, it could be used to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the Confederacy. He proposed that some of the state governors meet with Union governors of the Western states (what are called the <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwest</a> states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis's enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a <a href="grand_strategy" title="wikilink">grand strategy</a>—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at the expense of Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, destroy the Federal army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans, ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to the government.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>While visiting his forces in Florida, which had just repelled a Union advance at <a href="Jacksonville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Jacksonville</a>, Beauregard received a telegram that his wife had died on March 2, 1864. Living in Union-occupied New Orleans, she had been seriously ill for two years. A Northern-leaning local newspaper printed an opinion that her condition had been exacerbated by the actions of her husband. This so fanned negative popular opinion that 6,000 people attended her funeral. Union Maj. Gen. <a href="Nathaniel_P._Banks" title="wikilink">Nathaniel P. Banks</a> provided a steamer to carry her body upriver for burial in her native parish. Beauregard wrote that he would like to rescue &quot;her hallowed grave&quot; at the head of an army.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="richmond">Richmond</h3>
<p>In April 1864, Beauregard saw little opportunity for military glory because he foresaw that there would be no more significant assaults against Charleston, and prospects for a major field command were unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to <a href="Weldon,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Weldon, North Carolina</a>, near the Virginia border, to play a key role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the <a href="James_River_(Virginia)" title="wikilink">James River</a>. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of Union Lt. Gen. <a href="Ulysses_S._Grant" title="wikilink">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>As Grant moved south against Lee in the <a href="Overland_Campaign" title="wikilink">Overland Campaign</a>, Maj. Gen. <a href="Benjamin_Franklin_Butler_(politician)" title="wikilink">Benjamin Butler</a> launched the surprise <a href="Bermuda_Hundred_Campaign" title="wikilink">Bermuda Hundred Campaign</a> with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond to the aid of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to <a href="Petersburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Petersburg</a> and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. <a href="Robert_Hoke" title="wikilink">Robert Hoke</a>'s) to Lee for the <a href="Battle_of_Cold_Harbor" title="wikilink">Battle of Cold Harbor</a>, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of the right wing of the <a href="Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="wikilink">Army of Northern Virginia</a> for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a <a href="Passive&lt;U+2013&gt;aggressive_behavior" title="wikilink">passive&lt;U+2013&gt;aggressive</a> manner, &quot;I am willing to do anything for our success, but cannot leave my Department without orders of War Department.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Petersburg_June15-16.png" title="fig:Beauregard&#39;s defense of Petersburg, Federal assaults of June 15–18" alt="Beauregard&#39;s defense of Petersburg, Federal assaults of June 15–18" /> After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate high command were unable to anticipate Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed him to make a prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the <a href="Second_Battle_of_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Second Battle of Petersburg</a>. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard continued commanding the defenses of Petersburg in the early days of the <a href="Siege_of_Petersburg" title="wikilink">siege</a>, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the <a href="Battle_of_Globe_Tavern" title="wikilink">Battle of Globe Tavern</a> (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. <a href="Jubal_Early" title="wikilink">Jubal Early</a> to lead an expedition north through the <a href="Shenandoah_Valley" title="wikilink">Shenandoah Valley</a> and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. <a href="John_Bell_Hood" title="wikilink">John Bell Hood</a> to replace the faltering <a href="Joseph_E._Johnston" title="wikilink">Joseph E. Johnston</a> in the <a href="Atlanta_Campaign" title="wikilink">Atlanta Campaign</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="return-to-the-west">Return to the West</h3>
<p>After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis considered replacing John Bell Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in <a href="Augusta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Augusta, Georgia</a>, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and <a href="Richard_Taylor_(general)" title="wikilink">Richard Taylor</a> under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The major field operation of the fall was Hood's <a href="Franklin-Nashville_Campaign" title="wikilink">Franklin-Nashville Campaign</a>, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements without regard to the consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. <a href="William_T._Sherman" title="wikilink">William T. Sherman</a> began his <a href="Sherman&#39;s_March_to_the_Sea" title="wikilink">March to the Sea</a> from Atlanta to <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah</a>, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Nashville" title="wikilink">Battle of Nashville</a>; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard attempted to concentrate his small forces before Sherman could reach Columbia, South Carolina, the state capital. His urgent dispatches to Richmond were treated with disbelief—Davis and Robert E. Lee (now the general in chief of all the Confederate armies) could not believe that Sherman was advancing without a supply line as quickly as Beauregard was observing him do. Also concerned about what he considered Beauregard's &quot;feeble health,&quot; Lee recommended to Davis that he be replaced by Joseph E. Johnston. The change of command came on February 22 and Beauregard, although outwardly cooperative and courteous to Johnston, was bitterly disappointed at his replacement. For the remainder of the war, Beauregard was Johnston's subordinate, assigned to routine matters without combat responsibilities. Johnston and Beauregard met with President Davis on April 13 and their assessment of the Confederate situation helped convince Davis that Johnston should meet with Sherman to negotiate a surrender of his army. The two surrendered to Sherman near <a href="Durham,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Durham, North Carolina</a>, on April 26, 1865, and were paroled in <a href="Greensboro,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Greensboro</a> on May 2. Beauregard traveled to Mobile and then took a U.S. naval transport to his hometown of New Orleans.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="postbellum-life">Postbellum life</h2>
<p><img src="Pierre_Beauregard.pageantofamerica.jpg" title="fig:Beauregard, later in life" alt="Beauregard, later in life" /> After the war, Beauregard was reluctant to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He was one of many Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by Pres. <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a> on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by Pres. Grant on July 24, 1876.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard pursued a position in the <a href="Brazilian_Army" title="wikilink">Brazilian Army</a> in 1865, but declined the Brazilians' offer. He claimed that the positive attitude of Pres. Johnson toward the South swayed his decision. &quot;I prefer to live here, poor and forgotten, than to be endowed with honor and riches in a foreign country.&quot; He also declined offers to take command of the armies of <a href="United_Principalities" title="wikilink">Romania</a> and <a href="Khedivate_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>As a lifelong <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>, Beauregard worked to end <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> rule during <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>. His outrage over the excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He was active in the Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> and voting for the recently freed <a href="slavery" title="wikilink">slaves</a>, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard's first employment following the war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of the <a href="New_Orleans,_Jackson_and_Great_Northern" title="wikilink">New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern</a> Railroad. In 1866 he was promoted to president, a position he retained until 1870, when he was ousted in a hostile takeover. This job overlapped with that of president of the <a href="New_Orleans_and_Carrollton_Railroad" title="wikilink">New Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway</a> (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>After the loss of these two railway executive positions, Beauregard spent time briefly at a variety of companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the <a href="Louisiana_State_Lottery_Company" title="wikilink">Louisiana Lottery</a> in 1877. He and former Confederate general <a href="Jubal_Early" title="wikilink">Jubal Early</a> presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard's military writings include <em>Principles and Maxims of the Art of War</em> (1863), <em>Report on the Defense of Charleston</em>, and <em>A Commentary on the Campaign and Battle of Manassas</em> (1891). He was the uncredited co-author of his friend Alfred Roman's <em>The Military Operations of General Beauregard in the War Between the States</em> (1884). He contributed the article &quot;The Battle of Bull Run&quot; to <em>Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</em> in November 1884. During these years, Beauregard and Davis published a series of bitter accusations and counter-accusations retrospectively blaming each other for the Confederate defeat.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard served as <a href="adjutant_general" title="wikilink">adjutant general</a> for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. In 1888, he was elected as commissioner of <a href="public_works" title="wikilink">public works</a> in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying &quot;We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I am sorry he is gone. I am no hypocrite.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Beauregard died in his sleep in New Orleans. The cause of death was &quot;heart disease, aortic insufficiency, and probably <a href="myocarditis" class="uri" title="wikilink">myocarditis</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="Edmund_Kirby_Smith" title="wikilink">Edmund Kirby Smith</a>, the last surviving full general of the Confederacy, served as the &quot;chief mourner&quot; as Beauregard was interred in the vault of the <a href="Army_of_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Army of Tennessee</a> in historic <a href="Metairie_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Metairie Cemetery</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn20">Eicher, pp. 124, 323; Williams, p. 103. The official names of Beauregard's command were the Department of the Potomac (May 31 – June 2), the Alexandria Line (June 2–20), and the <a href="Confederate_Army_of_the_Potomac" title="wikilink">Confederate Army of the Potomac</a> (June 20 – July 21). After the First Battle of Bull Run, Joseph E. Johnston merged his <a href="Confederate_Army_of_the_Shenandoah" title="wikilink">Army of the Shenandoah</a> with Beauregard's and commanded the overall force, which was later renamed the <a href="Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="wikilink">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. Beauregard persisted in calling his part of the army the Army of the Potomac, although he was in essence a corps commander in that army, reporting to Johnston until March 14, 1862.<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
