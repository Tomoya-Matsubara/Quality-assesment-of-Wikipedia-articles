<p>The <strong>2012 Delhi gang rape</strong> case involved a <a href="Rape_in_India" title="wikilink">rape</a> and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in <a href="Munirka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munirka</a>, a neighbourhood in <a href="South_Delhi" title="wikilink">South Delhi</a>, when a 23-year-old female <a href="physical_therapy" title="wikilink">physiotherapy</a> intern <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was beaten and <a href="gang_rape" title="wikilink">gang raped</a> in a private bus in which she was travelling with a male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. The woman died from her injuries thirteen days later while undergoing emergency treatment in Singapore.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the <a href="Government_of_Delhi" title="wikilink">state</a> and <a href="Government_of_India" title="wikilink">central</a> governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country.</p>
<p>All the accused were arrested and charged with <a href="sexual_assault" title="wikilink">sexual assault</a> and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody on 11 March 2013 in the <a href="Tihar_Jail" title="wikilink">Tihar Jail</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defence lawyers and his family suspect he was murdered.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The juvenile was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death by hanging.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> On 13 March 2014, <a href="Delhi_High_Court" title="wikilink">Delhi High Court</a> in the death reference case and hearing appeals against the conviction by the lower Court, upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of the protests, in December 2012, a judicial committee was set up to study and take public suggestions for the best ways to amend laws to provide quicker investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. After considering 80,000 suggestions, the committee submitted a report which indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. In 2013, the <a href="Criminal_Law_(Amendment)_Ordinance,_2013" title="wikilink">Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013</a> was promulgated by President <a href="Pranab_Mukherjee" title="wikilink">Pranab Mukherjee</a>, several new laws were passed, and six new fast-track courts were created to hear rape cases. Critics argue that the legal system remains slow to hear and prosecute rape cases, but most agree that the case has resulted in a tremendous increase in the public discussion of crimes against women and statistics show that there has been an improvement in the number of women willing to file a crime report. At a memorial held in December 2013, the press interviewed a young woman who had taken part in the protests a year earlier. She related that while &quot;A welcome change is that the taboo on discussion of rape and sexual violence has been broken,&quot; she saw &quot;absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>
<p>The victims, a 23-year-old woman and a male friend, were on their way home on the night of 16 December 2012 after watching the film <em><a href="Life_of_Pi_(film)" title="wikilink">Life of Pi</a></em> in <a href="Saket_(Delhi)" title="wikilink">Saket</a>, <a href="South_Delhi" title="wikilink">South Delhi</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> They boarded an off-duty charter bus at <a href="Munirka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munirka</a> for <a href="Dwarka_Sub_City" title="wikilink">Dwarka</a> that was being driven by <a href="Joyride_(crime)" title="wikilink">joyriders</a> at about 9:30 pm (<a href="Indian_Standard_Time" title="wikilink">IST</a>). There were only six others on the bus, including the driver. One of the men, a minor, had called for passengers telling them that the bus was going towards their destination.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The woman's friend became suspicious when the bus deviated from its normal route and its doors were shut. When he objected, the group of six men already on board, including the driver, taunted the couple, asking what they were doing alone at such a late hour.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>When the woman's friend tried to intervene, he was beaten, gagged and knocked unconscious with an iron rod. The men then dragged the woman to the rear of the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that the woman suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a <a href="Jack_(device)" title="wikilink">wheel jack handle</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>According to police reports the woman attempted to fight off her assailants, biting three of the attackers and leaving bite marks on the accused men.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After the beatings and rape ended, the attackers threw both victims from the moving bus. Then the bus driver allegedly tried to drive the bus over the woman, but she was pulled aside by her male friend. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence. Police impounded it the next day.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The partially clothed victims were found on the road by a passerby at around 11 pm (IST). The passerby phoned the <a href="Delhi_Police" title="wikilink">Delhi Police</a>, who took the couple to <a href="Safdarjung_Hospital" title="wikilink">Safdarjung Hospital</a>, where the female victim was given emergency treatment and placed on mechanical ventilation.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> She was found with injury marks, including numerous bite marks, all over her body. According to reports, one of the accused men admitted to having seen a rope-like object, assumed to be her intestines, being pulled out of the woman by the other assailants on the bus. Two blood-stained metal rods were retrieved from the bus and medical staff confirmed that &quot;it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="victims">Victims</h2>
<p>The female victim was born and raised in <a href="Delhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delhi</a> while her parents were from a small village in the <a href="Ballia_district" title="wikilink">Ballia</a> district of <a href="Uttar_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Uttar Pradesh</a>. Her father sold his <a href="Chanvar" title="wikilink">agricultural land</a> to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a schoolteacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. &quot;Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. &quot;It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In compliance with Indian law, the real name of the victim was initially not released to the media, so pseudonyms were used for her by various media houses instead, including <em>Jagruti</em> (&quot;awareness&quot;), <em>Jyoti</em> (&quot;flame&quot;), <em>Amanat</em> (&quot;treasure&quot;), <em>Nirbhaya</em> (&quot;fearless one&quot;), <em>Damini</em> (&quot;lightning&quot;, after the <a href="Damini_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Lightning" title="wikilink">1993 Hindi film</a>) and Delhi braveheart.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The man who was attacked, a software engineer from <a href="Gorakhpur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gorakhpur</a>, Uttar Pradesh, who lives in <a href="Ber_Sarai" title="wikilink">Ber Sarai</a>, New Delhi, suffered broken limbs but survived.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Delhi police registered a criminal case against the editor of a Delhi-based tabloid, <em>Mail Today</em>, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <a href="Shashi_Tharoor" title="wikilink">Shashi Tharoor</a>, union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her, but Tharoor's remark created controversy.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, &quot;We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, the following day <a href="Zee_News" title="wikilink">Zee News</a> quoted the father as saying, &quot;I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="medical-treatment-and-death">Medical treatment and death</h2>
<p>On 19 December 2012, the woman underwent her fifth surgery, removing most of her remaining intestine. Doctors reported that she was in &quot;stable but critical&quot; condition.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> On 21 December, the government appointed a committee of physicians to ensure she received the best medical care.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> By 25 December, she remained <a href="tracheal_intubation" title="wikilink">intubated</a>, on <a href="life_support" title="wikilink">life support</a> and in <a href="medical_state" title="wikilink">critical condition</a>. Doctors stated that she was running a fever of 102 to 103 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (39 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) and internal bleeding due to <a href="sepsis" class="uri" title="wikilink">sepsis</a>, a severe blood infection that can lead to organ failure, was somewhat controlled. It was reported that she was &quot;stable, conscious and meaningfully communicative&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>At a cabinet meeting chaired by <a href="Manmohan_Singh" title="wikilink">Manmohan Singh</a> on 26 December, the decision was made to fly her to <a href="Mount_Elizabeth_Hospital" title="wikilink">Mount Elizabeth Hospital</a> in Singapore for further care. Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant speciality hospital.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an <a href="intensive_care_unit" title="wikilink">intensive care unit</a> (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or even months later.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Government sources indicate that the <a href="Chief_Minister_of_Delhi" title="wikilink">Chief Minister of Delhi</a>, <a href="Sheila_Dikshit" title="wikilink">Sheila Dikshit</a>, was personally behind the decision.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Hours earlier, Union Minister <a href="P._Chidambaram" title="wikilink">P. Chidambaram</a> had stated that the woman was not in a condition to be moved.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> An anonymous source quoted by <em><a href="The_Sunday_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Sunday Guardian</a></em> stated that the decision to move her was taken &quot;when it was already clear that she would not survive the next 48 hours&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>During the six-hour flight by air-ambulance to Singapore on 27 December, the woman suddenly went into a &quot;near collapse&quot;, which a later report described as a cardiac arrest.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The doctors on the flight created an <a href="Arterial_catheter" title="wikilink">arterial line</a> to stabilise her, but she had been without pulse and blood pressure for nearly three minutes and never regained consciousness in Singapore.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 December, at 11 am (IST), her condition was extremely critical. The chief executive officer of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital said that the woman suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection, and that she was &quot;fighting for her life.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she died at 4:45 am on 29 December, Singapore Standard Time (2:15 am, 29 December, <a href="India_Standard_Time" title="wikilink">IST</a>; 8:45 pm, 28 December, <a href="UTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">UTC</a>).<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Her body was cremated on 30 December in Delhi under high police security. The <a href="Bharatiya_Janata_Party" title="wikilink">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP), the country's main opposition party, criticised the high security levels, stating that they were reminiscent of the <a href="The_Emergency_(India)" title="wikilink">Emergency Era</a>, during which civil liberties were suspended.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="arrests">Arrests</h2>
<p>Police found and arrested some suspects within 24 hours of the crime.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> From recordings made by a highway <a href="Closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">CCTV</a> vehicle, a description of the bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants with the help of the male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Six men were arrested in connection with the incident. They included Ram Singh, the bus driver, and his brother, Mukesh Singh, who were both arrested in <a href="Rajasthan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rajasthan</a>. Ram and Mukesh Singh lived in Ravidas camp, a slum in South Delhi.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Vinay Sharma, an assistant gym instructor, and Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, were both arrested in Delhi.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A seventeen-year-old juvenile from <a href="Badayun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badayun</a>, Uttar Pradesh,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> was arrested at the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi.

<p>According to reports, the group had been eating and drinking together and &quot;having a party&quot; earlier in the day.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> they decided to take it out &quot;to have some fun&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> With Mukesh Singh driving, they first picked up a carpenter who was charged 10 for a ticket and then robbed of 8,000 and ejected in South Delhi.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after the attacks, Gupta said he accepted his guilt and should be hanged.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Mukesh Singh, who was placed in <a href="Tihar_Jail" title="wikilink">Tihar Jail</a> after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and was kept in <a href="solitary_confinement" title="wikilink">solitary confinement</a> for his own protection.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Ram Singh was presented before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 December 2012.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He refused to participate in an identification process.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Investigation revealed a history of frequent drinking that resulted in &quot;blinding rage&quot;, &quot;bad temper&quot;, and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him &quot;mental&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a ventilator shaft in his cell at about 5:45 am.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Authorities said it was unclear whether it was a suicide or a murder.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The <a href="Jammu_and_Kashmir" title="wikilink">Jammu and Kashmir</a> government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes. The <a href="Government_of_Himachal_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Government of Himachal Pradesh</a> decided to set up state and district-level committees to review progress of all cases of crimes against women.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="justice-verma-committee-and-changes-in-law">Justice Verma Committee and changes in law</h3>

<p>On 22 December 2012, a judicial committee headed by <a href="Jagdish_Sharan_Verma" title="wikilink">J. S. Verma</a>, a former <a href="Chief_Justice_of_India" title="wikilink">Chief Justice of India</a> and one of India's most highly regarded Chief Justices and eminent jurists, was appointed by the Central government to submit a report within 30 days to suggest amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with <a href="sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">sexual assault</a> cases. The committee urged the public in general and particularly eminent jurists, legal professionals, NGOs, women's groups and civil society to share &quot;their views, knowledge and experience suggesting possible amendments in the criminal and other relevant laws to provide for quicker investigation, prosecution and trial, and also enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault of an extreme nature against women.&quot;.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> The Committee held its first meeting on 26 December 2012; it had received more than 6000 emails with suggestions by then.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> The Justice Verma Committee report was submitted after 29 days, after considering 80,000 suggestions received during the period. The report indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. Suggestions in the report included the need to review the <a href="Armed_Forces_(Special_Powers)_Act,_1958" title="wikilink">Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958</a> (AFSPA) in conflict areas, and setting the maximum punishment for rape as life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. The committee did not favour lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a><a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>On 26 December 2012, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former Delhi High Court judge <a href="Usha_Mehra" title="wikilink">Usha Mehra</a> was set up to identify lapses, determine responsibility in relation to the incident, and suggest measures to make Delhi and the wider <a href="National_Capital_Region_(India)" title="wikilink">National Capital Region</a> safer for women.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> On 1 January 2013, a task force headed by the Union Home Secretary was established to look into women's safety issues in Delhi and review the functioning of the city police force on a regular basis.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>On 3 February 2013, the <a href="Criminal_Law_(Amendment)_Ordinance,_2013" title="wikilink">Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013</a> was promulgated by President <a href="Pranab_Mukherjee" title="wikilink">Pranab Mukherjee</a>. It provides for amendment of the <a href="Indian_Penal_Code" title="wikilink">Indian Penal Code</a>, <a href="Indian_Evidence_Act" title="wikilink">Indian Evidence Act</a>, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> The ordinance provides for the death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice <a href="Ashwani_Kumar" title="wikilink">Ashwani Kumar</a>, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalization of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>In a December 2013 interview, the rape victim's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, said they are trying to get the juvenile law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he committed the crime, in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<h3 id="anniversary-memorials">Anniversary memorials</h3>
<p>On 16 December 2013, the anniversary of the attack, activists held memorials throughout New Delhi in memory of the rape victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning &quot;fearless&quot;. Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where the woman and her friend boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister <a href="Sheila_Dikshit" title="wikilink">Sheila Dikshit</a> said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: &quot;... whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future&quot;.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<p>The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe &quot;has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them&quot;.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="improvements-to-the-legal-system">Improvements to the legal system</h3>
<p>The outpouring of anger and grief following the rape and murder gave rise to hopes for change in India.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> The government responded with the passage of several new sexual assault laws, including a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for gang rape, and six new fast-track courts created solely for rape prosecutions.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> As an indicator of the scope of the problem of rape prosecution, the &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; case was the only conviction obtained among the 706 rape cases filed in New Delhi in 2012.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Between 16 December 2012 and 4 January 2013, Delhi police recorded 501 allegations of harassment and 64 of rape, but only four inquiries were launched. However, it appears that the &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; case has had an effect on the willingness of rape or molestation victims to report the crime; police records show that during the final nine months of 2013 almost twice as many rape victims filed a police report and four times as many allegations of molestation were made.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> A recent report released by the <a href="National_Crime_Records_Bureau" title="wikilink">National Crime Records Bureau</a> shows that 95 percent of the cases brought to the police were classified as a crime. However, there is a large backlog of cases with fewer than 15 percent of those charged tried in 2012, leaving 85 percent waiting to come to trial.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>On 16 December 2013, the one-year anniversary of the rape was commemorated in London with a public memorial to honor the victim. Speakers included <a href="Meera_Syal" title="wikilink">Meera Syal</a>, whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of the anger that was expressed at the time of the rape, she said, &quot;We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking&quot;.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="public-discussions-about-violence-against-women">Public discussions about violence against women</h3>
<p>Observers agree that the victim's ordeal has brought a change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests at the time of the rape said a year later, &quot;A welcome change is that the taboo on discussing rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw &quot;absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [<a href="Eve_teasing" title="wikilink">Eve teasing</a>] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant.&quot;<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> She added, &quot;I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what <a href="patriarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriarchy</a> has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure&quot;.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nirbhaya-trust">Nirbhaya Trust</h3>
<p>The family of the victim recently established the Nirbhaya Trust,<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named <em>Nirbhaya</em> which means <em>fearless</em> in Hindi, after the name used by the media. The victim's father stated, &quot;So many people supported us, so ... we want [to] help those girls who have no one.&quot;<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
