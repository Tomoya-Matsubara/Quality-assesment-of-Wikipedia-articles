It was built in 3807 or 3806 BC and has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. It was the oldest <a href="timber_trackway" title="wikilink">timber trackway</a> discovered in <a href="Northern_Europe" title="wikilink">Northern Europe</a> until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000 year-old trackway in <a href="Belmarsh_(HM_Prison)" title="wikilink">Belmarsh prison</a>. It is now known that the Sweet Track was largely built over the course of an earlier structure, the <a href="Post_Track" title="wikilink">Post Track</a>.</p>
<p>The track extended across the marsh between what was then an island at <a href="Westhay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westhay</a>, although much of the marsh has now been drained, and a ridge of high ground at <a href="Shapwick,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Shapwick</a>, a distance close to . The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artefacts, including a <a href="jadeite" title="wikilink">jadeitite</a> axe head, have been found along its length.</p>
<p>Construction was of crossed wooden poles which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was only used for a period of around 10 years and then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970 most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a> and a reconstruction of a section was built at the <a href="Peat_Moors_Centre" title="wikilink">Peat Moors Centre</a> near <a href="Glastonbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glastonbury</a>.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>The track was built between what was in the early 4th millennium BC an island at <a href="Westhay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westhay</a>, and a ridge of high ground at <a href="Shapwick,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Shapwick</a> close to the <a href="River_Brue" title="wikilink">River Brue</a>. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of pre-historic lake dwellings, and were likely to have been similar to the later <a href="Glastonbury_Lake_Village" title="wikilink">Glastonbury Lake Village</a> near <a href="Godney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Godney</a>, itself built on a <a href="Marsh" title="wikilink">morass</a> on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, <a href="bracken" class="uri" title="wikilink">bracken</a>, rubble and clay.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby. These tracks connected settlements on the <a href="peat_bog" title="wikilink">peat bog</a>, and include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sites such as the nearby <a href="Meare_Pool" title="wikilink">Meare Pool</a> provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of <a href="Raised_bog" title="wikilink">raised peat bogs</a> around it, particularly during the <a href="Subatlantic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Subatlantic</a> climatic period (<a href="1st_millennium_BC" title="wikilink">1st millennium BC</a>), and <a href="Core_sample" title="wikilink">core sampling</a> demonstrates that it is filled with at least  of detritus mud.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The two villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="discovery-and-study">Discovery and study</h2>
<p>The track was discovered in 1970 during <a href="peat" class="uri" title="wikilink">peat</a> excavations, and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The company he worked for, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>, who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Coles's interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which funded by various donors including <a href="English_Heritage" title="wikilink">English Heritage</a>, ran from 1973 to 1989. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennium BC.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The work of John Coles, Bryony Coles and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the <a href="Imperial_Chemical_Industries" title="wikilink">Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)</a> Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Dendrochronology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dendrochronology</a> (tree-ring dating) of the timbers has enabled precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806 BC.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> until the discovery in 2009 of a 6,000 year-old trackway in <a href="Belmarsh_prison" title="wikilink">Belmarsh prison</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into <a href="Neolithic_Era" title="wikilink">Neolithic Era</a> dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the <a href="River_Trent" title="wikilink">River Trent</a> and a submerged forest at <a href="Stolford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stolford</a> enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The wood used to build the track is now classed as <a href="bog-wood" class="uri" title="wikilink">bog-wood</a>, the name given to wood that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from <a href="Decomposition" title="wikilink">decaying</a> by the <a href="acid" title="wikilink">acidic</a> and <a href="Hypoxia_(environmental)" title="wikilink">anaerobic</a> bog conditions. Bog-wood is usually stained brown by <a href="tannin" title="wikilink">tannins</a> dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossilisation</a>. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the <a href="Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" title="wikilink">Department of the Environment</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="Hache_222.1_Prespective.jpg" title="fig:A polished jadeitite axe head from the Museum de Toulouse" alt="A polished jadeitite axe head from the Museum de Toulouse" /> In 1973 a <a href="jadeite" title="wikilink">jadeitite</a> axehead was found alongside the track, and is thought to have been placed there as an offering.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> One of over 100 similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition suggests that it was a symbolic axe, rather than being used to cut wood.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="Radiocarbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radiocarbon</a> dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> although more recent work has suggested a similar age to the track. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a tomahawk, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads and a <a href="Flint_tool" title="wikilink">chipped flint axe</a> (in mint condition) have also been found.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="geophysical" class="uri" title="wikilink">geophysical</a> survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear <a href="magnetometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">magnetometer</a> data; the wood may be influencing the peat's <a href="hydrology" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrology</a>, causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="builders">Builders</h2>
<p>The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Before this human incursion the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl and, in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit and seeds.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p><img src="Sweet_track_cross_section2.jpg" title="fig:Diagram showing a cross section of the Sweet track" alt="Diagram showing a cross section of the Sweet track" /> Built in 3807 or 3806 BC,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> the track was a walkway consisting mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed poles of <a href="Ash_tree" title="wikilink">ash</a>, <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a> and <a href="Tilia" title="wikilink">lime</a>, driven into the underlying peat.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Curves at the base of the poles show that they were taken from <a href="Coppicing" title="wikilink">coppiced</a> woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to  long and  in diameter, made of mostly <a href="hazel" class="uri" title="wikilink">hazel</a> and <a href="alder" class="uri" title="wikilink">alder</a>, were laid down and held in place with wooden pegs.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The crossed poles were then driven into the soil either side of the rail and planks were notched and laid along the X shapes to form the walkway.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The planks, which were up to  wide,  long and less than  thick, were cut from trees up to 400 years old and  in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges and mallets.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Some of the planks were then stabilised with a slender, vertical wooden peg driven through a hole cut near the end and into the peat, or sometimes into the clay beneath.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Fragments of other tree species including <a href="holly" class="uri" title="wikilink">holly</a>, <a href="willow" class="uri" title="wikilink">willow</a>, <a href="poplar" class="uri" title="wikilink">poplar</a>, <a href="dogwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">dogwood</a>, <a href="ivy" class="uri" title="wikilink">ivy</a>, <a href="birch" class="uri" title="wikilink">birch</a>, and <a href="apple" class="uri" title="wikilink">apple</a> have also been found.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="wetland" class="uri" title="wikilink">wetland</a> setting indicates that the track components must have arrived <a href="prefabrication" title="wikilink">prefabricated</a>, before being assembled on site,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> although the presence of wood chips and chopped branches indicates that some trimming was performed locally.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The track was constructed from about  of timber, but Coles estimates that once the materials were transported to the site, ten men could have assembled it in one day.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sweet Track was used only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and therefore curtailed its use.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest that it was in daily use as part of the farming life of the community.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the <a href="Post_Track" title="wikilink">Post Track</a>, which dates from 3838 BC and which is thus 30 years older.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
