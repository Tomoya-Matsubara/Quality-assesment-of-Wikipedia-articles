<p><strong><em>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</em></strong> (often shortened to <strong><em>Borat</em></strong>) is a <a href="2006_in_film" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a>-nominated <a href="mockumentary" class="uri" title="wikilink">mockumentary</a> <a href="comedy_film" title="wikilink">comedy film</a> directed by <a href="Larry_Charles" title="wikilink">Larry Charles</a>. It stars the <a href="British_people" title="wikilink">British</a> comedian <a href="Sacha_Baron_Cohen" title="wikilink">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> in the <a href="Borat_Sagdiyev" title="wikilink">title role</a> of a fictitious <a href="Kazakhstan" title="wikilink">Kazakh</a> journalist, traveling through the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> recording real-life interactions with Americans. It is the second film built around one of Cohen's characters from <em><a href="Da_Ali_G_Show" title="wikilink">Da Ali G Show</a></em>, following <em><a href="Ali_G_Indahouse" title="wikilink">Ali G Indahouse</a></em>, which also featured a <a href="Cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo</a> by Borat.</p>
<p>It was a critical and commercial success, despite an initially limited release in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Cohen won the <a href="64th_Golden_Globe_Awards" title="wikilink">2007 Golden Globe Award</a> for <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_-_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy" title="wikilink">Best Actor: Musical or Comedy</a> as Borat while the film was nominated for <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_-_Musical_or_Comedy" title="wikilink">Best Motion Picture</a> in the same category.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Borat</em> was also nominated for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Writing_Adapted_Screenplay" title="wikilink">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> at the <a href="79th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">79th Academy Awards</a> but lost to <em><a href="The_Departed" title="wikilink">The Departed</a></em>.</p>
<p>Controversy surrounded the film even before its release. It has been criticised for having a protagonist who is <a href="Sexism" title="wikilink">sexist</a> and <a href="Antisemitism" title="wikilink">antisemitic</a> (although Cohen is <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> himself), and some who have appeared in the film have criticised and even sued its creators. All <a href="Arab_world" title="wikilink">Arab countries</a>, except for <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>, banned it,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the <a href="Government_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Russian government</a> successfully discouraged cinemas there from showing it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It was released on <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> <a href="March_5" title="wikilink">March 5</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> (a day later in <a href="DVD_region_code" title="wikilink">Region 1</a> countries).</p>

<p><a href="Borat" title="wikilink">Borat Sagdiyev</a> (Sacha Baron Cohen), a popular Kazakh <a href="television_personality" title="wikilink">television personality</a>, leaves his homeland for the 'Greatest Country in the World,' the &quot;<a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US and A</a>&quot; to make a <a href="documentary_film" title="wikilink">documentary</a> at the behest of the fictitious Kazakh Ministry of Information. He leaves behind his mother, his sister, his wife Oksana and the town rapist, bringing along his producer Azamat Bagatov (<a href="Ken_Davitian" title="wikilink">Ken Davitian</a>). Much of the movie features unscripted <a href="Vignette_(literature)" title="wikilink">vignettes</a> of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans who believe he is a foreigner with no understanding of <a href="Culture_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American customs</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>While in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>, he sees an episode of <em><a href="Baywatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baywatch</a></em> on television and immediately falls in love with <a href="Pamela_Anderson" title="wikilink">Pamela Anderson</a>. He questions the <a href="Veteran_Feminists_of_America" title="wikilink">Veteran Feminists of America</a>, learning her name and that she lives in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. He receives a telegram and learns, much to his delight, that his violent wife has been violated and killed by a bear. He resolves to go to California to 'have' Anderson's &quot;<a href="Vagina" title="wikilink">vazh&lt;U+00EF&gt;n</a>&quot; and make her his new wife. Borat and Azamat were supposed to remain in New York, but Borat justifies the trip by telling the skeptical producer that &quot;<a href="Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Pearl Harbor</a> is there (California) and so is <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>&quot;. As Azamat is afraid to fly there for fear of a repetition of the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, which he believes were <a href="9/11_conspiracy_theories#Claims_related_to_Jews_and_Israel" title="wikilink">the work of the Jews</a>, Borat takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated <a href="Ice_cream_van" title="wikilink">ice cream truck</a> for the journey.</p>
<p>During the cross-country trip, Borat acquires a <em>Baywatch</em> television show booklet at a <a href="yard_sale" title="wikilink">yard sale</a>, and continues gathering <a href="footage" class="uri" title="wikilink">footage</a> for his documentary. He meets <a href="gay_pride_parade" title="wikilink">gay pride parade</a> participants, <a href="politician" title="wikilink">politicians</a> (including <a href="Alan_Keyes" title="wikilink">Alan Keyes</a> and <a href="Bob_Barr" title="wikilink">Bob Barr</a>) and <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> youths playing <a href="Cee-lo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cee-lo</a>. He is also interviewed on live television and proceeds to disrupt the weather report. Visiting a <a href="rodeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">rodeo</a>, the reporter, after first exciting the crowd with <a href="Jingoism" title="wikilink">jingoistic</a> pro-U.S. remarks, sings a fictional Kazakhstan <a href="national_anthem" title="wikilink">national anthem</a> to the tune of &quot;<a href="The_Star-Spangled_Banner" title="wikilink">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>&quot;, which receives a strong negative reaction. Staying at a <a href="bed_and_breakfast" title="wikilink">bed and breakfast</a>, Borat and his producer are stunned to learn that their hosts are <a href="Jews" title="wikilink">Jewish</a>. Fearful of death (or worse) at the hands of their hosts, the two &quot;escape&quot; after throwing money toward <a href="cockroach" title="wikilink">cockroaches</a> which they believe are their Jewish hosts <a href="shapeshifting" title="wikilink">self-transformed</a>. While Azamat advises a return to New York (where at least, he believes, there are no Jews), Borat attempts to purchase a <a href="handgun" class="uri" title="wikilink">handgun</a> to defend himself against Jews. When told he cannot buy a gun because he is not an <a href="United_States_nationality_law" title="wikilink">American citizen</a>, Borat purchases a <a href="bear" class="uri" title="wikilink">bear</a>, which he names after his late wife, for protection.</p>
<p>Borat later attends a private dinner at an eating club in the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">South</a>, at which he (unintentionally) insults or otherwise offends the other guests, and visits an <a href="antique" class="uri" title="wikilink">antique</a> shop with a display of <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> heritage items, breaking glass and <a href="Dishware" title="wikilink">crockery</a>.</p>
<p>The journey is interrupted when Borat, just out of the bathtub, exits the bathroom of his hotel room and sees Azamat <a href="masturbation" title="wikilink">masturbating</a> over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the <em>Baywatch</em> book. Borat becomes enraged and discloses his real reason for traveling to California. Things escalate into a fully nude brawl, with what have been described as homoerotic undertones,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed <a href="ballroom" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballroom</a> filled with mortgage brokers at a convention. The two are finally separated by security guards.</p>
<p>As a result, Azamat abandons Borat, taking his <a href="passport" class="uri" title="wikilink">passport</a>, all of their money, and their bear, whose head is later seen inside a motel <a href="refrigerator" class="uri" title="wikilink">refrigerator</a>. Borat begins to <a href="hitchhiking" title="wikilink">hitchhike</a> to California, but is soon picked up by Anthony, Justin and David, drunken <a href="University_of_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">University of South Carolina</a> <a href="Fraternities_and_sororities" title="wikilink">fraternity</a> brothers. On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the <em>Pam and Tommy</em> sex video, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the <em>Baywatch</em> booklet and, by mistake, his return <a href="Ticket_(admission)" title="wikilink">ticket</a> to Kazakhstan. He regains his faith after attending a <a href="United_Pentecostal_Church" title="wikilink">United Pentecostal</a> camp meeting, at which <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Chip_Pickering" title="wikilink">Chip Pickering</a> and current <a href="Supreme_Court_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Mississippi Supreme Court</a> Chief Justice <a href="James_W._Smith,_Jr." title="wikilink">James W. Smith, Jr.</a> are present. He learns to forgive Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and disembarks to find Azamat dressed as <a href="Oliver_Hardy" title="wikilink">Oliver Hardy</a> (though Borat thinks that he is dressed as <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Hitler</a>). The two reconcile and Azamat tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson.</p>
<p>Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a <a href="Virgin_Megastores" title="wikilink">Virgin Megastore</a>. After showing Anderson his &quot;<a href="Bride_kidnapping" title="wikilink">traditional marriage sack</a>,&quot; Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to abduct her until he is tackled and handcuffed by security guards. Afterwards, Borat seeks out and marries a <a href="prostitute" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitute</a> named <a href="Luenell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luenell</a>, whom he had befriended earlier in the film, and returns to Kazakhstan with her. The final scene shows the changes that Borat's observations in America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion of the people to <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> (the Kazakh version of which includes <a href="crucifixion" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifixion</a> of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as <a href="iPod" title="wikilink">iPods</a>, <a href="laptop" class="uri" title="wikilink">laptop</a> computers and a high-definition, <a href="LCD" class="uri" title="wikilink">LCD</a> television.</p>
<h2 id="deleted-scenes">Deleted scenes</h2>
<p>The DVD included several deleted scenes from the film, including Borat being questioned by police officers at a traffic stop, visiting an animal shelter to get a dog to protect him from Jews, getting a massage at a hotel, and visiting an American doctor. There is also a montage of scenes cut from the film, including Borat taking a job at <a href="Krystal_(restaurant)" title="wikilink">Krystal</a> and taking part in a <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> <a href="American_Civil_War_reenactment" title="wikilink">reenactment</a>. The deleted scenes menu also includes an actual local TV news report about Borat's rodeo singing and a final &quot;happy ending&quot; scene about Borat appearing in a Kazakh show entitled &quot;<em>Sexydrownwatch</em>', a <em><a href="Baywatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baywatch</a></em> clone which also starred Azamat, Luenell, and <a href="Alexandra_Paul" title="wikilink">Alexandra Paul</a>.</p>
<p>A scene in which Borat was apparently imprisoned was also filmed, but removed under the threat of legal action by prison officials when they caught on to the &quot;documentary's&quot; true nature.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The scene was leaked onto YouTube, but is not on the DVD release.</p>
<p><a href="Dan_Mazer" title="wikilink">Dan Mazer</a> confirmed in an interview that there was a scene cut in which Borat took part in the shooting of an actual pornographic film. He claimed the scene was cut for fears of excess alongside the naked hotel fight, although he had then anticipated it may be included on the DVD release.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>With the exception of Borat, Azamat, Luenell and Pamela Anderson, none of the characters are portrayed by actors.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Most scenes in the film were unscripted,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> although the end credits do credit a &quot;Naked Fight Coordinator.&quot; In most cases the film's participants were given no warning on what they would be taking part in except for being asked to sign release forms agreeing not to take legal action against the film's producers.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Filming was already underway in January <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, when Cohen caused a near <a href="riot" class="uri" title="wikilink">riot</a> in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> An interview with Cohen by <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> indicated that over 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film, while <a href="Internet_Movie_Database" title="wikilink">IMDb</a> states that during this time Borat's antics led to police being called on Cohen 91 times.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Also according to IMDB, the end credits appear to be taken from Soviet-era Estonian TV commercials, and the man represented at the end of the sequence as Kazakhstan's leader is in reality <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>'s president <a href="Ilham_Aliyev" title="wikilink">Ilham Aliyev</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The &quot;<a href="Kazakhstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kazakhstan</a>&quot; depicted in the film has little or no relationship with the actual country and the producers explicitly deny attempting to &quot;convey the actual beliefs, practices or behavior of anyone associated with Kazakhstan&quot; in the <a href="all_persons_fictitious_disclaimer" title="wikilink">&quot;all persons fictitious&quot; disclaimer</a>. The scenes showing Borat's home village were filmed in the village of <a href="Glod,_D&lt;U+00E2&gt;mbovi&lt;U+0163&gt;a" title="wikilink">Glod</a>, <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The name of Borat's neighbor, Nursultan Tulyakbay, is a cross between the names of Kazakh President <a href="Nursultan_Nazarbayev" title="wikilink">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a> and opposition politician <a href="Zharmakhan_Tuyakbay" title="wikilink">Zharmakhan Tuyakbay</a>.</p>
<p>No <a href="Kazakh_language" title="wikilink">Kazakh language</a> is heard in the film.

The lettering on the airplane in the beginning of the film is in fact merely the result of English characters on a reversed image, while promotional materials spell &quot;BOR&lt;U+0414&gt;T&quot; with a <a href="Cyrillic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Cyrillic</a> <a href="De_(Cyrillic)" title="wikilink">letter for D</a> substituted for the &quot;A&quot; in <a href="Faux_Cyrillic" title="wikilink">Faux Cyrillic</a> style typically used to give a &quot;Russian&quot; appearance.

<h3 id="previews">Previews</h3>

<p><em>Borat</em> was previewed at the <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="Comic_Con_International" title="wikilink">Comic Con International</a> in <a href="San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">San Diego, California</a> on <a href="July_21" title="wikilink">July 21</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Its first screening to a paying audience was during the 2006 <a href="Traverse_City_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Traverse City Film Festival</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> where it won the Excellence in Filmmaking Award.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The film's official debut was in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> on <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> at the <a href="Ryerson_University" title="wikilink">Ryerson University</a> Theatre during the <a href="Toronto_International_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. Sacha Baron Cohen arrived in character as Borat in a cart pulled by women dressed as peasants. Twenty minutes into the showing, however, the projector broke. Cohen performed an impromptu act to keep the audience amused, but ultimately all attempts to fix the equipment, including one by <a href="Michael_Moore" title="wikilink">Michael Moore</a>, failed.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The film was successfully screened the following night, with <a href="Dustin_Hoffman" title="wikilink">Dustin Hoffman</a> in attendance.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In Israel, a proposed poster depicting Borat in a <a href="mankini" class="uri" title="wikilink">mankini</a> was rejected by the film's advertising firm in favor of one showing him in his normal suit.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="scaled-back-u.s.-release">Scaled-back U.S. release</h3>
<p>In late October 2006, less than two weeks before the film's debut, <a href="Twentieth_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">Twentieth Century Fox</a> scaled back its American release from about 2,000 to 800 cinemas after marketing-survey data showed unexpectedly poor levels of audience awareness. The move surprised industry professionals, who could not recall such a move being made so close to a film's release.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Despite this move, the film opened at number one in the box office, maintaining first place for two weeks straight. The film actually earned more in the second week ($28,269,900) than in the first ($26,455,463), due to an expansion onto 2,566 screens.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="film-release">Film release</h3>
<p><em>Borat</em> entered public release on <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> in <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, and by <a href="November_3" title="wikilink">November 3</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> it had opened in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> as well as 14 <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> countries. Upon its release it was a massive hit, taking in US$26.4 million in its opening weekend, the highest ever in the United States and Canada for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> On its second weekend, <em>Borat</em> surpassed its opening with a total of US$29 million.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<h3 id="critical">Critical</h3>
<p><em>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</em> was exceptionally well received by critics. In an article about the changing face of comedy, <em><a href="The_Atlantic_Monthly" title="wikilink">The Atlantic Monthly</a></em> (which does not review films) said that it &quot;may be the funniest film in a decade&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <a href="Michael_Medved" title="wikilink">Michael Medved</a> gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;..simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that you'll want to describe to your friends and then laugh all over again when you do.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> classified it as one of the best-reviewed films of <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, with an aggregate &quot;fresh&quot; rating of 90%.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>One negative review came from British critic <a href="Mark_Kermode" title="wikilink">Mark Kermode</a>, who noted that he was the only one not laughing at his screening. He claimed that the film had a rampant undertone of <a href="anti-Americanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Americanism</a> and that it failed to get beyond just laughing at the average <a href="blue-collar" class="uri" title="wikilink">blue-collar</a> American.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Similar sentiments were expressed by American critic <a href="Joe_Queenan" title="wikilink">Joe Queenan</a>, who went as far as to call Cohen an &quot;odious twit.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In an article for <em><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a></em>, writer <a href="Christopher_Hitchens" title="wikilink">Christopher Hitchens</a> offered a counter-argument to suggestion of anti-Americanism in the film. Hitchens suggested instead that the film actually demonstrated amazing tolerance on the part of the film's unknowing subjects, especially citing the reactions of the guests in the Southern dinner scene to Borat's behavior.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to being considered for appearance in the film, all potential participants were required to sign long <a href="legal_release" title="wikilink">release</a> forms agreeing not to take legal action for any defamation of character or fraud carried out during the film's production.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The usual disclaimer included at the end of the film's credits, stating that all characters in the film were fictitious, also noted that &quot;No real person depicted or appearing in the film has sponsored or otherwise endorsed its contents.&quot;</p>
<p>After the movie's release, Dharma Arthur, a news producer for <a href="WAPT" class="uri" title="wikilink">WAPT</a> television in <a href="Jackson,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, wrote a letter to <em>Newsweek</em> saying that Borat's appearance on the station had led to her losing her job: &quot;Because of him, my boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything I did thereafter... How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is lauded as a comedic genius.&quot; Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the AP that she left the station.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> She claims to have checked a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>In news coverage that aired in January 2005 of the filming of the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the <a href="Salem,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Salem, Virginia</a> rodeo depicted in the movie, provided background on how he had become the victim of a <a href="hoax" class="uri" title="wikilink">hoax</a>. He said that &quot;months&quot; prior to the appearance, he had been approached by someone from &quot;One America, a California-based film company that was reportedly doing a documentary on a Russian immigrant&quot;; he agreed to permit the &quot;immigrant&quot; to sing the [U.S.] national anthem after listening to a tape.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> After the film's release, Rowe said &quot;Some people come up and say, 'Hey, you made the big time'; I've made the big time, but not in the way I want it.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Rowe had expressed distrust of Muslims and advocated the execution of homosexuals in the film.

<p>Etiquette expert Cindy Streit of Birmingham, Alabama said that prior to Borat's visit, she thought it would be a &quot;wonderful opportunity to display some of our positive strengths. I'm proud to be an American, so I wanted to show this man our gracious <a href="Southern_hospitality" title="wikilink">Southern hospitality</a>&quot;; instead, the visit became &quot;the dinner party from hell.&quot; Republican fund-raiser Sarah Moseley said, &quot;He insulted all of us, but we sat there and took it because we thought we were really going to make a difference. So we were angry when we found out that we had been duped.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Streit has subsequently hired high-profile attorney <a href="Gloria_Allred" title="wikilink">Gloria Allred</a>, who is demanding the <a href="California_Attorney_General" title="wikilink">California Attorney General</a> investigate &quot;fraud&quot; allegedly committed by Cohen and the film's producers.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> By contrast, the guest whom Borat had described as a &quot;<a href="mental_retardation" title="wikilink">retard</a>&quot; after &quot;misunderstanding&quot; a statement that he was <a href="Retirement" title="wikilink">retired</a>, commented that &quot;we got out of this pretty clean.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>There are conflicting reports regarding the feelings of the participants of the scenes in which Borat and Azamat stay at a guest house owned by a Jewish couple. The British newspaper <em><a href="The_Sun" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> claims that a scene depicting cockroaches running around in their home has hurt Mariam and Joseph Behar's business in <a href="Newton,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Newton, Massachusetts</a>.

<p>The feminists from <a href="Veteran_Feminists_of_America" title="wikilink">Veteran Feminists of America</a> (VFA) also felt that they had been duped, having &quot;sensed something odd was going on&quot; before and during the interview with Borat. <em>The Guardian</em> later reported at least one of the women felt that the film was worth going to see at the cinema.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em> had reported in November 2006 that Pamela Anderson filed for divorce from her husband <a href="Kid_Rock" title="wikilink">Kid Rock</a> after he reacted unfavorably to the movie during a screening. <em>The Post</em>'s article specifically claimed he had said on her role in the film, &quot;You're nothing but a whore!

<p>The Kazakhstani tabloid <em><a href="Karavan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karavan</a></em> declared <em>Borat</em> to be the best film of the year, having had a reviewer see the film at a screening in Vienna.

The album included music from the film, five tracks consisting of and titled &quot;Dialoguing excerpt from moviefilm&quot;, as well as the controversial anti-Semitic song &quot;<a href="In_My_Country_There_Is_Problem" title="wikilink">In My Country There Is Problem</a>&quot; from <em>Da Ali G Show</em>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>The region 2 DVD was released <a href="March_5" title="wikilink">March 5</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, with the region 1 release the following day.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Special features include <a href="deleted_scenes" title="wikilink">deleted scenes</a>, faux advertisements for the soundtrack album, and a complete <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian language</a> translation audio track using a professional dubbing cast, in addition to the <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>, <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, and <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish language</a> tracks common on Region 1 (US/Canada) DVDs. There is also a choice of Hebrew as well, but this is merely a joke. Choosing the Hebrew language option results in a warning screen appears reading &quot;You have been trapped, Jew!&quot; which warns the viewer not to change his shape and keep his claws where they can be seen, again playing on the anti-Semitism supposedly prevalent in Borat's version of Kazakhstan. It also includes footage of Borat's publicity tour for the film, with Cohen in character as Borat on the <em><a href="Tonight_Show" title="wikilink">Tonight Show</a></em>, <em><a href="Late_Night_With_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Late Night With Conan O'Brien</a></em>, the <a href="Toronto_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Toronto Film Festival</a>, and <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em>. Also, there is a section of <a href="WSLS-TV" title="wikilink">a news story from Virginia</a>, about Borat and the rodeo he visited with the Rodeo owner (Bobby Rowe) being interviewed</p>
<p>As a play on the intellectual property piracy common in the former <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, the packaging of the Region 1 (United States/Canada), 2 (Europe/Japan/South Africa/Middle East) and 4 (Latin America/Oceania) editions mimics a foreign bootleg DVD. The slipcover is in English but the case itself has all-Cyrillic text (a majority of which is in legitimate Russian, not faux Cyrillic) and is made to look poorly photocopied. The disc itself is made to look like a &quot;Demorez&quot; <a href="DVD-R" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD-R</a> (a parody of <a href="Memorex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Memorex</a>, with the similar slogan &quot;Is life? No. Demorez.&quot;) with the word &quot;BO&lt;U+042F&gt;AT&quot; appearing to be crudely written in marker and the &quot;R&quot; <a href="Ya_(Cyrillic)" title="wikilink">written backwards</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Backwards R is actually a Russian vowel in the same way the Russian D is used for an A. The UMD version is similar to the DVD, even being labelled a &quot;UMD-R&quot; (which do not actually exist). Even the Fox in-cover advertising is written in broken English that appears poorly printed, indicating that there are &quot;More movie discs available from us&amp;a&quot; and &quot;Also legal to own in Kazakhstan&quot;.</p>
<p>There are further jokes within the DVD itself. The menus are styled as a worn, static-laden film on an erratically functioning projector, with more Cyrillic writing accompanied with translations in broken English. The DVD is described as a &quot;prerecorded moviedisc for purpose domestic viewing of moviefilm&quot; and the viewer is warned that &quot;selling piratings of this moviedisc will result in punishment by <a href="crushing" class="uri" title="wikilink">crushing</a>.&quot; The DVD's collection of trailers promises these films are &quot;coming Kazakhstan in 2028.&quot;</p>
