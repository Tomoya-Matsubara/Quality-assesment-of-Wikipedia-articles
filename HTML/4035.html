The French <a href="libretto" class="uri" title="wikilink">libretto</a> was adapted from <a href="Maurice_Maeterlinck" title="wikilink">Maurice Maeterlinck</a>'s <a href="Symbolism_(arts)" title="wikilink">Symbolist</a> play <em><a href="Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as_and_M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande" title="wikilink">Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</a></em>. It premiered at the <a href="Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> on 30 April 1902 with <a href="Jean_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rier" title="wikilink">Jean P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rier</a> as Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and <a href="Mary_Garden" title="wikilink">Mary Garden</a> as M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande in a performance conducted by <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Messager" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Messager</a>, who was instrumental in getting the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique to stage the work.

<p>The plot concerns a <a href="love_triangle" title="wikilink">love triangle</a>. Prince Golaud finds a mysterious young woman, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, lost in a forest. He marries her and brings her back to the castle of his grandfather, King Arkel of Allemonde. Here M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande becomes increasingly attached to Golaud&lt;U+2019&gt;s younger half-brother Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as, arousing Golaud&lt;U+2019&gt;s jealousy. Golaud goes to excessive lengths to find out the truth about Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande&lt;U+2019&gt;s relationship, even forcing his own child, Yniold, to spy on the couple. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as decides to leave the castle but arranges to meet M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande one last time and the two finally confess their love for one another. Golaud, who has been eavesdropping, rushes out and kills Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande dies shortly after, having given birth to a daughter, with Golaud still begging her to tell him &lt;U+201C&gt;the truth&lt;U+201D&gt;.</p>

<h3 id="debussys-ideal-of-opera">Debussy's ideal of opera</h3>
<p>Looking back in 1902, Debussy explained the protracted genesis of his only finished opera: &quot;For a long time I had been striving to write music for the theatre, but the form in which I wanted it to be was so unusual that after several attempts I had given up on the idea.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> There were many false starts before <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em>. In the 1880s the young composer had toyed with several opera projects (<em>Diane au Bois</em>, <em>Ax&lt;U+00EB&gt;l</em>) before accepting a libretto on the theme of <em><a href="El_Cid" title="wikilink">El Cid</a></em>, entitled <em><a href="Rodrigue_et_Chim&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne" title="wikilink">Rodrigue et Chim&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne</a></em>, from the poet and Wagner aficionado <a href="Catulle_Mend&lt;U+00E8&gt;s" title="wikilink">Catulle Mend&lt;U+00E8&gt;s</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, Debussy too was a devotee of Wagner's music, but - eager to please his father - he was probably more swayed by Mend&lt;U+00E8&gt;s' promise of a performance at the Paris Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra and the money and reputation this would bring. Mend&lt;U+00E8&gt;s' libretto, with its conventional plot, offered rather less encouragement to his creative abilities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the words of Victor Lederer, &quot;Desperate to sink his teeth into a project of substance, the young composer accepted the type of old-fashioned libretto he dreaded, filled with howlers and lusty choruses of soldiers calling for wine.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Debussy's letters and conversations with friends reveal his increasing frustration with the Mend&lt;U+00E8&gt;s libretto and the composer's enthusiasm for the Wagnerian aesthetic was also waning. In a letter of January 1892, he wrote, &quot;My life is hardship and misery thanks to this opera. Everything about it is wrong for me.&quot; And to <a href="Paul_Dukas" title="wikilink">Paul Dukas</a>, he confessed that <em>Rodrigue</em> was &quot;totally at odds with all that I dream about, demanding a type of music that is alien to me.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy was already formulating a new conception of opera. In a letter to Ernest Guiraud in 1890 he wrote: &quot;The ideal would be two associated dreams. No time, no place. No big scene [...] Music in opera is far too predominant. Too much singing and the musical settings are too cumbersome [...] My idea is of a short libretto with mobile scenes. No discussion or arguments between the characters whom I see at the mercy of life or destiny.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It was only when Debussy discovered the new <a href="Symbolist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Symbolist</a> plays of <a href="Maurice_Maeterlinck" title="wikilink">Maurice Maeterlinck</a> that he found a form of drama that answered his ideal requirements for a libretto.</p>

<p>Maurice Maeterlinck (1862 â€“ 1949)</p>
</center>
<p>]] Maeterlinck's plays were tremendously popular with the avant-garde in the Paris of the 1890s. They were anti-naturalistic in content and style, forsaking external drama for a symbolic expression of the inner life of the characters.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Debussy had seen a production of Maeterlinck's first play <em><a href="Princess_Maleine" title="wikilink">La princesse Maleine</a></em> and, in 1891, he applied for permission to set it but Maeterlinck had already promised it to <a href="Vincent_d&#39;Indy" title="wikilink">Vincent d'Indy</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy's interest shifted to <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em>, which he had read some time between its publication in May 1892 and its first performance at the <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E2&gt;tre_des_Bouffes-Parisiens" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E2&gt;tre des Bouffes-Parisiens</a> on 17 May 1893, a staging the composer attended.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> was a work that fascinated many other musicians of the time: both <a href="Gabriel_Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> and <a href="Jean_Sibelius" title="wikilink">Jean Sibelius</a> composed <a href="incidental_music" title="wikilink">incidental music</a> for the play, and <a href="Arnold_Schoenberg" title="wikilink">Arnold Schoenberg</a> was to write a <a href="tone_poem" title="wikilink">tone poem</a> on the theme. Debussy found in it the ideal opera libretto for which he had been searching.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In a 1902 article, &quot;Pourquoi j&lt;U+2019&gt;ai &lt;U+00E9&gt;crit Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as&quot; (Why I wrote Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as), Debussy explained the appeal of the work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The drama of Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as which, despite its dream-like atmosphere, contains far more humanity than those so-called &lt;U+2018&gt;real-life documents&lt;U+2019&gt;, seemed to suit my intentions admirably. In it there is an evocative language whose sensitivity could be extended into music and into the orchestral backcloth.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Debussy abandoned work on <em>Rodrigue and Chim&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne</em> and, in August 1893, he approached Maeterlinck via his friend, the poet <a href="Henri_de_R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gnier" title="wikilink">Henri de R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gnier</a>, for permission to set <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em>. Maeterlinck was happy to grant it. R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gnier claimed Debussy had already started work on the music but the evidence suggests that he did not begin composing the score until September.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In November, Debussy made a trip to <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, where he played excerpts from his work in progress to the famous violinist <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Ysa&lt;U+00FF&gt;e" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Ysa&lt;U+00FF&gt;e</a> in <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a> before visiting Maeterlinck at his home in <a href="Ghent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghent</a>. Debussy described the playwright as being initially as shy as a &quot;girl meeting an eligible young man&quot;, but the two soon warmed to each other. Maeterlinck authorised Debussy to make whatever cuts in the play he wanted. He also admitted to the composer that he knew nothing about music.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p>Debussy began work on <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> in September 1893. He decided to remove four scenes from the play (Act I Scene 1, Act II Scene 4, Act III Scene 1, Act V Scene 1<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>), significantly reducing the role of the serving-women to one silent appearance in the last act. He also cut back on the elaborate descriptions of which Maeterlinck was fond. Debussy's method of composition was fairly systematic; he worked on only one act at a time but not necessarily in chronological order. The first scene that he wrote was Act 4 Scene 4, the climactic love scene between Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy finished the short score of the opera (without detailed orchestration) on 17 August 1895. He did not go on to produce the full score needed for rehearsals until the <a href="Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique</a> accepted the work in 1898. At this point he added the full orchestration, finished the vocal score, and made several revisions. It is this version that went into rehearsals in January 1902.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="finding-a-venue">Finding a venue</h3>
<p>Debussy spent years trying to find a suitable venue for the premiere of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em>, realising he would have difficulties getting such an innovative work staged. As he confided to his friend Camille Mauclair in 1895: &quot;It is no slight work. I should like to find a place for it, but you know I am badly received everywhere.&quot; He also told Mauclair that he had contemplated asking the wealthy aesthete <a href="Robert_de_Montesquiou" title="wikilink">Robert de Montesquiou</a> to have it performed at his Pavillon des Muses, but nothing came of this.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The composer and conductor <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Messager" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Messager</a> was a great admirer of Debussy's music and had heard him play extracts from the opera. When Messager became chief conductor of the <a href="Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique</a> theatre in 1898, his enthusiastic recommendations prompted <a href="Albert_Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Albert Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, the head of the opera house, to visit Debussy and hear the work played on the piano at two sessions, in May 1898 and April 1901. On the strength of this, Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt; accepted the work for the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique and on 3 May 1901 gave Debussy a written promise to perform the opera the following season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trouble-with-maeterlinck">Trouble with Maeterlinck</h3>
<p><img src="Mary_Garden_in_Debussy&#39;s_Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as_et_M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lsande.jpg" title="fig:The first M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, Mary Garden" alt="The first M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, Mary Garden" width="250" /> Debussy had promised the role of M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande to Maeterlinck's companion <a href="Georgette_Leblanc" title="wikilink">Georgette Leblanc</a> and had even rehearsed the part with her privately. But Albert Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt; became keen on a new Scottish singer, <a href="Mary_Garden" title="wikilink">Mary Garden</a>, who had captivated the Parisian public when she had taken over the lead role in <a href="Gustave_Charpentier" title="wikilink">Gustave Charpentier</a>'s <em><a href="Louise_(opera)" title="wikilink">Louise</a></em> shortly after its premiere in 1900. Debussy was at first reluctant to comply with Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt; but when he heard Garden sing, he was so impressed that he later recalled: &quot;That was the gentle voice that I had heard in my inmost being, with its hesitantly tender and captivating charm, such that I had barely dared to hope for.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Maeterlinck first learned of Debussy's preference for Garden when an announcement appeared in <em>Le m&lt;U+00E9&gt;nestrel</em> newspaper on 29 December 1901. He was furious and tried to take legal action to prevent the opera from going ahead. When this failed, he threatened Debussy with physical violence, telling Leblanc he was going to &quot;give Debussy a drubbing to teach him what was what,&quot; and Madame Debussy had to dissuade him from attacking her husband with a cane. On 14 April, <em><a href="Le_Figaro" title="wikilink">Le Figaro</a></em> published a letter from Maeterlinck in which he completely dissociated himself from the production, complaining about the cuts that had been made in the libretto (although he had originally sanctioned them) and describing &quot;the <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> in question&quot; as &quot;a work that is strange and hostile to me [...] I can only wish for its immediate and decided failure.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Maeterlinck finally saw the opera in 1920, two years after Debussy's death. He later confessed: &quot;In this affair I was entirely wrong and he was a thousand times right.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rehearsals">Rehearsals</h3>
<p>Rehearsals for <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em> began on 13 January 1902 and went on for 15 weeks; Debussy was present for 69 of the sessions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande was not the only role which caused casting problems: the child who was to play Yniold was not chosen until 5 March. In the event, the boy (Blondin) proved incapable of singing the part competently and Yniold's main scene (Act IV Scene 3) was cut and only reinstated in later performances when the role was given to a woman. The rehearsals also showed that the stage machinery of the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique was unable to cope with the rapid set changes the libretto demanded and Debussy had to compose orchestral interludes to cover them.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Many of the orchestra and cast were hostile to Debussy's innovative work and, in the words of Roger Nichols, &quot;may not have taken altogether kindly to the composer's injunction, reported by Mary Garden, to 'forget, please, that you are singers'.&quot; The dress rehearsal took place on the afternoon of Monday, 28 April and was a rowdy affair. Someone (in Mary Garden's view, Maurice Maeterlinck) distributed a salacious parody of the libretto to the audience, who also laughed at Garden's Scottish accent (she allegedly pronounced <em>courage</em> as <em>curages</em>, meaning &quot;the dirt that gets stuck in drains&quot;).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The censor, Henri Roujon, asked Debussy to make a number of cuts before the premiere, including a mention of the word &quot;bed&quot;. Debussy agreed but kept the libretto unaltered in the published score.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

The sets were designed in the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pre-Raphaelite</a> style by <a href="Lucien_Jusseaume" title="wikilink">Lucien Jusseaume</a> and <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Ronsin" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Ronsin</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The premiere received a warmer reception than the dress rehearsal because a group of Debussy aficionados counterbalanced the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique's regular subscribers, who found the work so objectionable. Messager described the reaction: &quot;[It was] certainly not a triumph, but no longer the disaster of two days before...From the second performance onwards, the public remained calm and above all curious to hear this work everyone was talking about...The little group of admirers, <a href="Paris_Conservatoire" title="wikilink">Conservatoire</a> pupils and students for the most part, grew day by day...&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Critical reaction was mixed. Some accused the music of being &quot;sickly and practically lifeless&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and of sounding &quot;like the noise of a squeaky door or a piece of furniture being moved about, or a child crying in the distance.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="Camille_Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns" title="wikilink">Camille Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns</a>, a relentless opponent of Debussy's music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and &quot;say nasty things about <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> But others &lt;U+2014&gt; especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes &lt;U+2014&gt; were highly enthusiastic. Debussy's friend <a href="Paul_Dukas" title="wikilink">Paul Dukas</a> lauded the opera, <a href="Romain_Rolland" title="wikilink">Romain Rolland</a> described it as &quot;one of the three or four outstanding achievements in French musical history&quot;,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and <a href="Vincent_d&#39;Indy" title="wikilink">Vincent d'Indy</a> wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century <a href="Italian_opera" title="wikilink">Italian opera</a>. D'Indy found <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> moving, too: &quot;The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the <em>human</em> feelings and <em>human</em> sufferings in <em>human</em> terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The opera won a &quot;cult following&quot; among young aesthetes, and the writer <a href="Jean_Lorrain" title="wikilink">Jean Lorrain</a> satirised the <em>&quot;Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;astres&quot;</em> who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden and the rest of the cast.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="performance-history">Performance history</h2>
<p>The initial run lasted for 14 performances, making a profit for the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique. It became a staple part in the repertory of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25Â January 1913.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1908, <a href="Maggie_Teyte" title="wikilink">Maggie Teyte</a> took over the role of M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: <em>&quot;Une autre anglaiseâ€”Mon Dieu&quot;</em> (&quot;Another Englishwomanâ€”my God&quot;). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a teacher he was pedanticâ€”that's the only word. Really pedantic [...] There was a core of anger and bitterness in himâ€”I often think he was rather like Golaud in <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> and yet he wasn't. He wasâ€”it's in all his musicâ€”a very sensual man. No one seemed to like him. Jean P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rier, who played Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as to my M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, went white with anger if you mentioned the name of Debussy...<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Debussy's perfectionismâ€”plus his dislike of the attendant publicityâ€”was one of the reasons why he rarely attended performances of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em>. However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the <a href="Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E2&gt;tre_de_la_Monnaie" title="wikilink">Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E2&gt;tre de la Monnaie</a>, <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a> on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in <a href="Frankfurt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankfurt</a> on 19 April of the same year, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> at the <a href="Manhattan_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Manhattan Opera House</a> on 19Â February 1908, and at <a href="La_Scala" title="wikilink">La Scala</a>, <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a> with <a href="Arturo_Toscanini" title="wikilink">Arturo Toscanini</a> conducting on 2 April 1908.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a> on 21 May 1909.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In the years following <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the popularity of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em> began to fade somewhat. As Roger Nichols writes, &quot;[The] two qualities of being escapist and easily caricatured meant that in the brittle, post-war Parisian climate <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> could be written off as no longer relevant.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The situation was the same abroad and in 1940 the English critic Edward J. Dent observed that &quot;<em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em> seems to have fallen completely into oblivion.&quot; However, the Canadian premiere was given that same year at the <a href="Montreal_Festivals" title="wikilink">Montreal Festivals</a> under the baton of <a href="Wilfrid_Pelletier" title="wikilink">Wilfrid Pelletier</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Interest was further revived by the famous production which debuted at the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique on 22 May 1942 under the baton of <a href="Roger_D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sormi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" title="wikilink">Roger D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sormi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a> with <a href="Jacques_Jansen" title="wikilink">Jacques Jansen</a> and <a href="Ir&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Joachim" title="wikilink">Ir&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Joachim</a> in the title roles. The couple became &quot;the Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande for a whole generation of opera-goers, last appearing together at the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique in 1955.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Notable later productions include those with set designs by <a href="Jean_Cocteau" title="wikilink">Jean Cocteau</a> (first performed in <a href="Marseille" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marseille</a> in 1963), and the 1969 <a href="Covent_Garden" title="wikilink">Covent Garden</a> production conducted by <a href="Pierre_Boulez" title="wikilink">Pierre Boulez</a>. Boulez's rejection of the tradition of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> conducting caused controversy among critics who accused him of &quot;Wagnerising&quot; Debussy, to which Boulez responded that the work was indeed heavily influenced by Wagner's <em><a href="Parsifal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parsifal</a></em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Boulez returned to conduct <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> in an acclaimed production by the German director <a href="Peter_Stein" title="wikilink">Peter Stein</a> for the <a href="Welsh_National_Opera" title="wikilink">Welsh National Opera</a> in 1992. Modern productions have frequently re-imagined Maeterlinck&lt;U+2019&gt;s setting, often moving the time period to the present day or other time period; for instance, the 1985 <a href="Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra_National_de_Lyon" title="wikilink">Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra National de Lyon</a> production set the opera during the <a href="Edwardian_era" title="wikilink">Edwardian era</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="act-1">Act 1</h3>
<p><em>Scene 1: A forest</em></p>
<p>Prince Golaud, grandson of King Arkel of Allemonde, has become lost while hunting in the forest. He discovers a frightened, weeping girl sitting by a spring in which a crown is visible. She reveals her name is M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande but nothing else about her origins and refuses to let Golaud retrieve her crown from the water. Golaud persuades her to come with him before the forest gets dark.</p>
<p><em>Scene 2: A room in the castle</em></p>
<p>Six months have passed. Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve, the mother of the princes Golaud and Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as, reads a letter to the aged and nearly blind King Arkel. It was sent by Golaud to his brother Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as. In it Golaud reveals that he has married M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, although he knows no more about her than on the day they first met. Golaud fears that Arkel will be angry with him and tells Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as to find how he reacts to the news. If the old man is favourable then Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as should light a lamp from the tower facing the sea on the third day; if Golaud does not see the lamp shining, he will sail on and never return home. Arkel had planned to marry the widowed Golaud to Princess Ursule in order to put an end to &quot;long wars and ancient hatreds&quot;, but he bows to fate and accepts Golaud's marriage to M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as enters, weeping. He has received a letter from his friend Marcellus, who is on his deathbed, and wants to travel to say goodbye to him. Arkel thinks Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as should wait for the return of Golaud, and also reminds Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as of his own father, lying sick in bed in the castle. Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve tells Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as not to forget to light the lamp for Golaud.</p>
<p><em>Scene 3: Before the castle</em></p>
<p>Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande walk in the castle grounds. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande remarks how dark the surrounding gardens and forest are. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as arrives. They look out to sea and notice a large ship departing and a lighthouse shining, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande foretells that it will sink. Night falls. Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve goes off to look after Yniold, Golaud's young son by his previous marriage. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as attempts to take Melisande's hand to help her down the steep path but she refuses saying that she is holding flowers. He tells her he might have to go away tomorrow. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande asks him why.</p>

<p>It is a hot summer day. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as has led M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande to one of his favourite spots, the &quot;Blind Men's Well&quot;. People used to believe it possessed miraculous powers to cure blindness but since the old king's eyesight started to fail, they no longer come there. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande lies down on the marble rim of the well and tries to see to the bottom. Her hair loosens and falls into the water. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as notices how extraordinarily long it is. He remembers that Golaud first met M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande beside a spring and asks if he tried to kiss her at that time but she does not answer. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande plays with the ring Golaud gave her, throwing it up into the air until it slips from her fingers into the well. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as tells her not to be concerned but she is not reassured. He also notes that the clock was striking twelve as the ring dropped into the well. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande asks him what she should tell Golaud. He replies, &quot;the truth.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Scene 2: A room in the castle</em></p>
<p>Golaud is lying in bed with M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande at the bedside. He is wounded, having fallen from his horse while hunting. The horse suddenly bolted for no reason as the clock struck twelve. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as, she replies that he is not the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as can behave oddly and he is still very young. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today was the first time she saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as along with her.</p>
<p><em>Scene 3: Before a cave</em></p>
<p>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande make their way down to the cave in pitch darkness. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande is frightened to enter, but Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as tells her she will need to describe the place to Golaud to prove she has been there. The moon comes out lighting the cave and reveals three beggars sleeping in the cave. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as explains there is a famine in the land. He decides they should come back another day.</p>

<p>M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande is at the tower window, singing a song (<em>Mes longs cheveux</em>) as she combs her hair. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as appears and asks her to lean out so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down from the window and he kisses and caresses it instead. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as playfully ties M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande's hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests that someone might see them. A flock of doves takes flight. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande panics when she hears Golaud's footsteps approaching. Golaud dismisses Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as away.</p>
<p><em>Scene 2: The vaults of the castle</em></p>
<p>Golaud leads Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as down to the castle vaults, which contain the dungeons and a stagnant pool which has &quot;the scent of death.&quot; He tells Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as to lean over and look into the chasm while he holds him safely. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as finds the atmosphere stifling and they leave.</p>
<p><em>Scene 3: A terrace at the entrance of the vaults</em></p>
<p>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as is relieved to breathe fresh air again. It is noon. He sees Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande at a window in the tower. Golaud tells Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as that there must be no repeat of the &quot;childish game&quot; between him and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande last night. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande is pregnant and the least shock might disturb her health. It is not the first time he has noticed there might be something between Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande but Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as should avoid her as much as possible without making this look too obvious.</p>
<p><em>Scene 4: Before the castle</em></p>
<p>Golaud sits with his little son, Yniold, in the darkness before dawn and questions him about Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande. The boy reveals little that Golaud wants to know since he is too innocent to understand what he is asking. He says that Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande often quarrel about the door and that they have told Yniold he will one day be as big as his father. Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande) never send Yniold away because they are afraid when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark. He admits that he once saw Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande kiss &quot;when it was raining&quot;. Golaud lifts his son on his shoulders to spy on Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande through the window but Yniold says that they are doing nothing other than looking at the light. He threatens to scream unless Golaud lets him down again. Golaud leads him away.</p>

<p><em>Scene 1: A room in the castle</em></p>
<p>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as tells M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande that his father is getting better and has asked him to leave on his travels. He arranges a last meeting with M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande by the Blind Men's Well in the park.</p>

<p>Arkel tells M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande how he felt sorry for her when she first came to the castle &quot;with the strange, bewildered look of someone constantly awaiting a calamity.&quot; But now that is going to change and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande will &quot;open the door to a new era that I foresee.&quot; He asks her to kiss him. Golaud bursts in with blood on his forehead &lt;U+2014&gt; he claims it was caused by a thorn hedge. When M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande tries to wipe the blood away, he angrily orders her not to touch him and demands his sword. He says that another peasant has died of starvation. Golaud notices M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande is trembling and tells her he is not going to kill her with the sword. He mocks the &quot;great innocence&quot; Arkel says he sees in M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande's eyes. He commands her to close them or &quot;I will shut them for a long time.&quot; He tells M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair. When Golaud leaves, Arkel asks if he is drunk. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande simply replies that he does not love her any more. Arkel comments: &quot;If I were God, I would have pity on the hearts of men.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Scene 3: A well in the park</em></p>
<p>Yniold tries to lift a boulder to free his golden ball, which is trapped between it and some rocks. As darkness falls, he hears a flock of sheep suddenly stop bleating. A shepherd explains that they have turned onto a path that doesn't lead back to the sheepfold, but does not answer when Yniold asks where they will sleep. Yniold goes off to find someone to talk to.</p>
<p><em>Scene 4: The same</em></p>
<p>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as arrives alone at the well. He is worried that he has become deeply involved with M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave but first, he wants to see M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande one last time and tell her things he has kept to himself. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande says that it is for the better. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as with his sword and kills him. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods saying to a dying Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as that she does not have courage.</p>

<p>M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande sleeps in a sick bed after giving birth to her child. The doctor assures Golaud that despite her wound, her condition is not serious. Overcome with guilt, Golaud claims he has killed for no reason. Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande merely kissed &quot;like a brother and sister.&quot; M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande wakes and asks for a window to be opened so she can see the sunset. Golaud asks the doctor and Arkel to leave the room so he can speak with M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande alone. He blames himself for everything and begs Melisande's forgiveness. Golaud presses M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande to confess her forbidden love for Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as. She maintains her innocence in spite of Golaud's increasingly desperate pleas to her to tell the truth. Arkel and the doctor return. Arkel tells Golaud to stop before he kills M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande, but he replies &quot;I have already killed her.&quot; Arkel hands M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande her newborn baby girl but she is too weak to lift the child in her arms and remarks that the baby does not cry and that she will live a sad existence. The room fills with serving women, although no one can tell who has summoned them. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande quietly dies. At the moment of death, the serving women fall to their knees. Arkel comforts the sobbing Golaud.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="character-of-the-work">Character of the work</h2>
<h3 id="an-innovative-libretto">An innovative libretto</h3>
<p>Rather than engaging a librettist to adapt the original play for him (as was customary), Debussy chose to set the text directly, making only a number of cuts. Maeterlinck's play was in prose rather than verse. Russian composers, notably <a href="Modest_Mussorgsky" title="wikilink">Mussorgsky</a> (whom Debussy admired), had experimented with setting prose opera libretti in the 1860s, but this was highly unusual in France (or Italy or Germany). Debussy's example influenced many later composers who edited their own libretti from existing prose plays, e.g. <a href="Richard_Strauss" title="wikilink">Richard Strauss</a>' <em><a href="Salome_(opera)" title="wikilink">Salome</a></em>, <a href="Alban_Berg" title="wikilink">Alban Berg</a>'s <em><a href="Wozzeck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wozzeck</a></em> and <a href="Bernd_Alois_Zimmermann" title="wikilink">Bernd Alois Zimmermann</a>'s <em><a href="Die_Soldaten" title="wikilink">Die Soldaten</a></em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The nature of the libretto Debussy chose to set contributes to the most famous feature of the opera: the almost complete absence of arias or set pieces. There are only two reasonably lengthy passages for soloists: Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve's reading of the letter in Act One and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande's song from the tower in Act 3 (which would probably have been set to music in a spoken performance of Maeterlinck's play in any case).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Instead, Debussy set the text one note to a syllable in a &quot;continuous, fluid '<a href="cantilena" class="uri" title="wikilink">cantilena</a>', somewhere between chant and <a href="recitative" class="uri" title="wikilink">recitative</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="debussy-wagner-and-french-tradition">Debussy, Wagner and French tradition</h3>
<p><em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> reveals Debussy's deeply ambivalent attitude to the works of the German composer <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a>. As <a href="Donald_Grout" title="wikilink">Donald Grout</a> writes: &quot;it is customary, and in the main correct, to regard <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em> as a monument to French operatic reaction to Wagner&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Wagner had revolutionised 19th-century opera by his insistence on making his stage works more dramatic, by his increased use of the orchestra, his abolition of the traditional distinction between <a href="aria" class="uri" title="wikilink">aria</a> and <a href="recitative" class="uri" title="wikilink">recitative</a> in favour of what he termed &quot;endless melody&quot;, and by his use of <a href="leitmotifs" class="uri" title="wikilink">leitmotifs</a>, recurring musical themes associated with characters or ideas. Wagner was a highly controversial figure in France. Despised by the conservative musical establishment, he was a cult figure in &quot;avant-garde&quot; circles, particularly among literary groups such as the Symbolists, who saw parallels between Wagner's concept of the leitmotif and their use of the symbol. The young Debussy joined in this enthusiasm for Wagner's music, making a pilgrimage to the <a href="Bayreuth_Festival" title="wikilink">Bayreuth Festival</a> in 1888 to see <em><a href="Parsifal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parsifal</a></em> and <em><a href="Die_Meistersinger" title="wikilink">Die Meistersinger</a></em> and returning in 1889 to see <em><a href="Tristan_und_Isolde" title="wikilink">Tristan und Isolde</a></em>. Yet that same year he confessed to his friend Ernest Guiraud his need to escape Wagner's influence.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy was well aware of the dangers of imitating Wagner too closely. Several French composers had tried to write their own Wagnerian music dramas, including <a href="Emmanuel_Chabrier" title="wikilink">Emmanuel Chabrier</a> (<em>Gwendoline</em>) and <a href="Ernest_Chausson" title="wikilink">Ernest Chausson</a> (<em>Le roi Arthus</em>). Debussy was far from impressed by the results: &quot;We are bound to admit that nothing was ever more dreary than the neo-Wagnerian school in which the French genius had lost its way among the sham Wotans in Hessian boots and the Tristans in velvet jackets.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Debussy strove to avoid excessive Wagnerian influence on <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> from the start. The love scene was the first music he composed but he scrapped his early drafts for being too conventional and because &quot;worst of all, the ghost of old Klingsor,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> alias R.Wagner, kept appearing.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Debussy took several features from Wagner, including the use of leitmotifs, though these are &quot;rather the 'idea-leitmotifs' of the more mature Wagner of <em>Tristan</em> than the 'character-leitmotifs' of his earlier music-dramas.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Debussy referred to what he felt were Wagner's more obvious leitmotifs as a &quot;box of tricks&quot; (<em>bo&lt;U+00EE&gt;te &lt;U+00E0&gt; trucs</em>) and claimed there was &quot;no guiding thread in <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;s</em>&quot; as &quot;the characters are not subjected to the slavery of the leitmotif.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Yet, as Debussy admitted privately, there are themes associated with each of the three main characters in <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em>.</p>
<p>The continuous use of the orchestra is another feature of Wagnerian music drama, yet the way Debussy writes for the orchestra is completely different from <em>Tristan</em>, for example. In Grout's words, &quot;In most places the music is no more than an iridescent veil covering the text.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The emphasis is on quietness, subtlety and allowing the words of the libretto to be heard; there are only four <a href="fortissimo" title="wikilink">fortissimos</a> in the entire score. Debussy's use of declamation is un-Wagnerian as he felt Wagnerian melody was unsuited to the French language. Instead, he stays close to the rhythms of natural speech, making <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> part of a tradition which goes back to the French Baroque <em><a href="trag&lt;U+00E9&gt;dies_en_musique" title="wikilink">trag&lt;U+00E9&gt;dies en musique</a></em> of <a href="Rameau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rameau</a> and <a href="Lully" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lully</a> as well as the experiments of the very founders of opera, <a href="Jacopo_Peri" title="wikilink">Peri</a> and <a href="Giulio_Caccini" title="wikilink">Caccini</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Like <em>Tristan</em> the subject of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> is a love triangle set in a vaguely Medieval world. Unlike the protagonists of <em>Tristan</em>, the characters rarely seem to understand or be able to articulate their own feelings.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The deliberate vagueness of the story is paralleled by the elusiveness of Debussy's music.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-language">Use of language</h3>
<p>In both Debussy and Maeterlinck's view, the vagueness of the story is also expressed in the use of the language, which is usually lost in translation from French into English, since the characters switch back and forth between the formal &quot;vous&quot; and the familiar &quot;toi&quot;, which is used to somewhat express how the characters are thinking, for instance, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande always speaks to Golaud in the formal &quot;vous&quot; and when wanting to keep Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as to a distance, she uses that same form of speech, but when being more affectionate, she uses the familiar &quot;toi&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p><em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> was to be Debussy's only completed opera. For this reason it has sometimes been compared to <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Beethoven</a>'s <em><a href="Fidelio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fidelio</a></em>. As <a href="Hugh_Macdonald" title="wikilink">Hugh Macdonald</a> writes: &quot;Both operas were much-loved only children of doting creators who put so much into their making that there could be no second child to follow after.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> This was not for want of trying on Debussy's part, and he worked hard to create a successor. Details of several opera projects survive. The most substantial surviving musical sketches are for two works based on short stories by <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a>: <em><a href="Le_diable_dans_le_beffroi" title="wikilink">Le diable dans le beffroi</a></em> and <em><a href="La_chute_de_la_maison_Usher_(opera)" title="wikilink">La chute de la maison Usher</a></em>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Debussy also planned a version of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a href="As_You_Like_It" title="wikilink">As You Like It</a></em> with a libretto by <a href="Paul-Jean_Toulet" title="wikilink">Paul-Jean Toulet</a>, but the poet's opium addiction meant he was too lazy to write the text.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Two other projects suggest Debussy intended to challenge German composers on their own ground. <em>Orph&lt;U+00E9&gt;e-Roi</em> (<em>King Orpheus</em>) was to be a riposte to <a href="Christoph_Willibald_Gluck" title="wikilink">Gluck</a>'s <em><a href="Orfeo_ed_Euridice" title="wikilink">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>,</em> which Debussy considered to &quot;treat only the anecdotal, lachrymose aspect of the subject.&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> But, according to Victor Lederer, for &quot;shock value, neither [<em>As You Like It</em> nor <em>Orph&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em>] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on Vallas, one of Debussy's early biographers, its 'episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a>.' That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner's colossal <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the <a href="rectal_cancer" title="wikilink">rectal cancer</a> which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as</em> would remain a unique opera.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Marius_Constant" title="wikilink">Marius Constant</a> wrote a 20-minute &quot;Symphonie&quot; based on the opera.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recordings">Recordings</h2>

<p>The earliest recording of <em>Pell&lt;U+00E9&gt;as et M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lisande</em> is a 1904 <a href="Edison_cylinder" title="wikilink">Edison cylinder</a> recording of Mary Garden singing the passage &quot;Mes longs cheveux&quot;, with Debussy accompanying her on the piano.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The first complete recording of the opera was made by the Grand Orchestre Symphonique du Grammophone under conductor <a href="Piero_Coppola" title="wikilink">Piero Coppola</a> in 1927. The 1942 recording conducted by <a href="Roger_D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sormi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" title="wikilink">Roger D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sormi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a>, is considered a reference by most critics.</p>
