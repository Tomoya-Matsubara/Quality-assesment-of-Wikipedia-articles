The application of <a href="movable_type" title="wikilink">movable type</a> printing advanced the already widespread use of <a href="woodblock_printing" title="wikilink">woodblock printing</a> to educate and amuse <a href="Confucian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucian</a> students and the masses. The application of new weapons employing the use of <a href="gunpowder" class="uri" title="wikilink">gunpowder</a> enabled the Song Dynasty to ward of its militant enemies until its collapse to the <a href="Mongol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongol</a> forces of <a href="Kublai_Khan" title="wikilink">Kublai Khan</a>, late in the 13th century.</p>

<p>Intellectual men of letters like the versatile Shen Kuo dabbled in everything from mathematics, geography, economics, engineering, medicine, <a href="divination" class="uri" title="wikilink">divination</a>, art criticism, <a href="archeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">archeology</a>, military strategy, and diplomacy. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed the total number of possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although the <a href="drydock" class="uri" title="wikilink">drydock</a> had been known in <a href="Ptolemaic_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> since the late 3rd century BC (by a <a href="Phoenician" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a>; not used again until <a href="Henry_VII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VII of England</a> in 1495), the scientist and statesman mentioned above, Shen Kuo, wrote of its use in China to repair boats during the 11th century (in Wade-Giles):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At the beginning of the dynasty (c. +965) the two Che provinces (now <a href="Chekiang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chekiang</a> and southern <a href="Chiangsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chiangsu</a>) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00 m (200 ft)) in length.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The upper works included several decks with <a href="palace" title="wikilink">palatial</a> cabins and <a href="saloon" title="wikilink">saloons</a>, containing <a href="throne" title="wikilink">thrones</a> and <a href="couch" title="wikilink">couches</a> all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible as long as they were afloat. So in the Hsi-Ning reign period (+<a href="1068" class="uri" title="wikilink">1068</a> to +<a href="1077" class="uri" title="wikilink">1077</a>) a palace official <a href="Huang_Huai-Hsin" title="wikilink">Huang Huai-Hsin</a> suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Chin-ming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hanger in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Odometer2.jpg" title="fig:A modern mechanical odometer of an automobile." alt="A modern mechanical odometer of an automobile." width="200" /> Although the mechanically-driven mile-marking device of the carriage-drawn <a href="odometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">odometer</a> had been known in China since the ancient <a href="Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Han Dynasty</a>, the <em>Song Shi</em> of the Song period provides a much greater description and more in-depth view of the device than earlier Chinese sources (which wrote brief paragraphs about the device and its use). From the Song Shi, it states (Wade-Giles spelling, odometer is spelled as <em>hodometer</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Hodometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung-Hsi reign-period (+987 (AD)) the emperor Thai Tsung increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (+1027 (AD)) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of hodometers as follows:</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain <a href="Lu_Dao-long" title="wikilink">Lu Dao-long</a> on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels. On the body are two storeys, each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick. The road-wheels are each 6 ft in diameter, and 18 ft in circumference, one evolution covering 3 paces. According to ancient standards the pace was equal to 6 ft and 300 paces to a li; but now the li is reckoned as 360 paces of 5 ft each.</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower horizontal wheel (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches). (This engages with the former.)</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Upon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze &quot;turning-like-the-wind wheel&quot; (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, the distance between these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a horizontal wheel, 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the &quot;turning-like-the-wind wheel&quot; (1.2 inches).</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Next, there is fixed (on the same shaft) a small horizontal wheel (hsiao phing lun) 3.3 inches in diameter and 1 ft in circumference, having 10 cogs 1.5 inches apart. (Engaging with this) there is an upper horizontal wheel (shang phing lun) having a diameter of 3.3 ft and a circumference of 10 ft, with 100 cogs, the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel (1.5 inches).</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the &quot;dog-teeth&quot; mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point (ti hsiang kou so, chhuan ya hsiang chih, chou erh fu shih).</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

Movable type printing was further advanced in <a href="Joseon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joseon</a> era Korea, where Bi Sheng's baked clay characters were scrapped for metal type characters in 1234.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Although movable type and woodblock printing would remain as the dominant types of printing methods for centuries, the European <a href="printing_press" title="wikilink">printing press</a> (employing the <a href="Hellenistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hellenistic</a> <a href="screw" class="uri" title="wikilink">screw</a>-press) was eventually adopted by East Asian countries.</p>

The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire-lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of <a href="Dunhuang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunhuang</a>, dated circa 950 AD. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows (see <a href="Fire_Arrow" title="wikilink">Fire Arrow</a>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast-iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong').<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This ancestor to the gun was dually complimented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast-iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Chinese also discovered the explosive potential of packing hollowed cannonball shells with gunpowder. Written later around 1350 in the <em>Huo Long Jing</em>, this manuscript recorded an earlier Song-era cast-iron cannon known as the 'flying-cloud thunderclap eruptor' (fei yun pi-li pao). The manuscript stated that (Wade-Giles spelling):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The shells (phao) are made of cast iron, as large as a bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder (shen huo). They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor (mu phao); and when they get there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired successfully into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...</em><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted before, the change in terminology for these new weapons during the Song period were gradual. The early Song Dynasty cannons were at first termed the same way as the Chinese <a href="trebuchet" class="uri" title="wikilink">trebuchet</a> <a href="catapult" class="uri" title="wikilink">catapult</a>. A later <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a> scholar known as <a href="Mao_Yuan-yi" title="wikilink">Mao Yuan-yi</a> would explain this use of terminology and true origins of the cannon in his text of the <em>Wu Bei Zhi</em>, written in 1628 (Wade-Giles spelling):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Sung people used the turntable trebuchet (hsuan feng phao), the single-pole trebuchet (tan shao phao) and the squatting-tiger trebuchet (hu tun phao). They were all called 'fire trebuchets' (huo phao) because they were used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball (huo chhiu), (fire-)falcon (huo yao), and (fire-)lance (huo chhiang). They were the ancestors of the cannon (phao chih tsu).</em><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
