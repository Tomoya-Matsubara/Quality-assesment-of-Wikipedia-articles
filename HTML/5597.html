<p>Appel was born May 21, 1963 in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to Nina and <a href="Alfred_Appel" title="wikilink">Alfred Appel</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His mother was a lawyer, taught law and served as dean of <a href="Loyola_University_Chicago" title="wikilink">Loyola University Chicago</a>'s law school from 1983&lt;U+2013&gt;2004,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and his father was professor of English at <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> and an expert on <a href="Vladimir_Nabokov" title="wikilink">Vladimir Nabokov</a> (he died May 2, 2009).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Appel has a sister, Karen Oshman.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Appel lived in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> while his parents taught at <a href="Stanford_University" title="wikilink">Stanford University</a> before the family moved to <a href="Wilmette,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Wilmette, Illinois</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> where Appel went to <a href="North_Shore_Country_Day_School" title="wikilink">North Shore Country Day School</a>. Appel became interested in comedy from a young age, noting: &quot;I grew up watching <em><a href="The_Dick_Van_Dyke_Show" title="wikilink">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></em> and always thought that what <a href="Rob_Petrie" title="wikilink">Rob Petrie</a> did for a living was what I wanted to do.&quot; His father introduced him to the works of <a href="Buster_Keaton" title="wikilink">Buster Keaton</a> and <a href="Laurel_and_Hardy" title="wikilink">Laurel and Hardy</a> and encouraged him to &quot;read comic books and watch quality television&quot;,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> while he and a friend produced parody adverts and news pieces with a <a href="Betamax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Betamax</a> and often engaged in prank phone calls. At high school he wrote sketches and routines and dreamt of being a comedy writer, but &quot;didn't know anyone who did it, and it didn't seem like a career that was open to me.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>He attended <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a> and wrote for the <em><a href="Harvard_Lampoon" title="wikilink">Harvard Lampoon</a></em>, alongside <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a> and <a href="Greg_Daniels" title="wikilink">Greg Daniels</a>, both of whom he beat for the chance to give the comic graduation speech, the Ivy Oration. <a href="Tad_Friend" title="wikilink">Tad Friend</a> noted: &quot;Everyone thought it would be Conan automatically, but Rich's speech was funny and self-deprecating, in a way that was both silly and profound.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After graduating in 1985 with a degree in history and literature<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> he attended <a href="Harvard_Law_School" title="wikilink">Harvard Law School</a> rather than moving into comedy, &quot;appealed&quot; by the idea of following his mother and grandfathers in to the legal profession. He then, for two years, worked as a law clerk for federal justice <a href="John_M._Walker,_Jr." title="wikilink">John M. Walker, Jr.</a> at the <a href="United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="wikilink">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, working on the trials of people such as <a href="Michael_Milken" title="wikilink">Michael Milken</a> and <a href="Leona_Helmsley" title="wikilink">Leona Helmsley</a>. Subsequently, for three years from 1990, Appel served as assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Fellow attorney Geoffrey Berman stated Appel &quot;was an excellent lawyer. He was good on his feet, articulate, with a sense of the law that was common-sensical, more intuitive than based on books.&quot; Appel still harboured dreams of becoming a comedy writer despite the security working as a lawyer offered him, but in 1993 after his wife became pregnant Appel was &quot;reminde[d] that this was [his] life and [he] could shape it.&quot; Three months later Appel got an agent, had written and submitted two spec-scripts and moved to California.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="writing-career">Writing career</h2>

<p>When starting out as a comedy writer, Appel recalled: &quot;One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the <em>Lampoon</em>, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Appel got his first television job when <a href="David_Mirkin" title="wikilink">David Mirkin</a> hired him for the writing staff of <em>The Simpsons</em> in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and served as a writer and producer there for four years.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of &quot;joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Appel found work on <em>The Simpsons</em> to be a learning curve because it was a &quot;very tough show to write for.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> His first episode was <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_7)" title="wikilink">season seven's</a> &quot;<a href="Mother_Simpson" title="wikilink">Mother Simpson</a>&quot;. Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her <a href="Mona_Simpson_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Mona Simpson</a>, after his wife.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a>'s intelligence came from.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Also for season seven he penned &quot;<a href="Bart_on_the_Road" title="wikilink">Bart on the Road</a>&quot;, in which he utilized the plot devices of &quot;go to work with you parents day&quot; and <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> getting a driving license,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and contributed to the episode &quot;<a href="22_Short_Films_About_Springfield" title="wikilink">22 Short Films About Springfield</a>&quot;; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a>, the other about <a href="Lionel_Hutz" title="wikilink">Lionel Hutz</a>) were both cut.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Appel wrote two episodes from <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_8)" title="wikilink">season eight</a>, &quot;<a href="Bart_After_Dark" title="wikilink">Bart After Dark</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Secret_War_of_Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">The Secret War of Lisa Simpson</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> as well as <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_9)" title="wikilink">season nine's</a> &quot;<a href="The_Two_Mrs_Nahasapeemapetilons" title="wikilink">The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons</a>&quot; and <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_10)" title="wikilink">season 10's</a> &quot;<a href="When_You_Dish_Upon_A_Star" title="wikilink">When You Dish Upon A Star</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Daniels hired Appel as executive producer and showrunner on <em><a href="King_of_the_Hill" title="wikilink">King of the Hill</a></em> in 1997, leading the show's writing process and overseeing all aspects of the show. Daniel's noted: &quot;It was essential that Rich was a good writer who could deal with people, who could help manage the business in the room. But equally important was the fact that he was someone I could trust, who had a similar sense of taste and values.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He stayed until 2001.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> For his work on <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>King of the Hill</em>, Appel won three <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Primetime Emmy Awards</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Appel created the short-lived series <em><a href="A.U.S.A." class="uri" title="wikilink">A.U.S.A.</a></em>, which aired in 2003, which he based on his own experiences as a U.S. assistant attorney.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He conceived it in 2001 and <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> ordered 13 episodes the following year; the show's original pilot used a <a href="single-camera_setup" title="wikilink">single-camera setup</a> but the NBC's executives felt it would have more appeal as a <a href="multiple-camera_setup" title="wikilink">multiple-camera setup</a>, so it was re-shot.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Appel noted of the show: &quot;There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He was inspired by the comedic side of working as a lawyer when writing the show: &quot;Whether you're working on a case that you're proud to tell you mother and grandmother about, you're still going to encounter possibly really shifty dishonest lawyers, or a judge who is a little crazy, or witnesses who self-destruct on the stand.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The show was not acclaimed: Scott D. Pierce of <em><a href="The_Deseret_News" title="wikilink">The Deseret News</a></em> praised the premise but felt the show was &quot;sort of like watching a train wreck,&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> while Alan Sepinwall of <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">The Star-Ledger</a></em> said it was &quot;too cartoonish to work.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Appel then wrote and worked as a co-executive producer on <em><a href="The_Bernie_Mac_Show" title="wikilink">The Bernie Mac Show</a></em> and <em><a href="Kitchen_Confidential_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Kitchen Confidential</a></em>,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film <em><a href="I_&lt;U+2665&gt;_Huckabees" title="wikilink">I &lt;U+2665&gt; Huckabees</a></em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 2006, Appel produced a pilot called <em>My Ex Life</em> about two divorcing couples for <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>, which was directed by <a href="Kelsey_Grammer" title="wikilink">Kelsey Grammer</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, he served as a co-executive producer on <em><a href="Family_Guy" title="wikilink">Family Guy</a></em> and executive producer on <em><a href="American_Dad!" title="wikilink">American Dad!</a></em> from 2008 until 2009.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Appel wrote the <em>Family Guy</em> <a href="Family_Guy_(season_7)" title="wikilink">seventh season</a> episode &quot;<a href="Family_Gay" title="wikilink">Family Gay</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Appel co-created, alongside <a href="Mike_Henry_(voice_actor)" title="wikilink">Mike Henry</a> and <a href="Seth_McFarlane" title="wikilink">Seth McFarlane</a> the <em>Family Guy</em> spin-off <em><a href="The_Cleveland_Show" title="wikilink">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, which they began discussing in 2007 and which premiered September 27, 2009.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He and Henry serve as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from McFarlane.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Henry and Appel conceived the show as &quot;more of a family show, a sweeter show&quot; than <em>Family Guy</em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> was picked up by <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> It was extended to a full second season.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Appel signed a new three-year, seven figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on <em>The Cleveland Show</em> in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: &quot;What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability. He is a terrific showrunner, and he really sets the tone on a show that is exactly what you're looking for.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
