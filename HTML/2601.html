He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No.1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Headquarters Laverton, Hannah was sent to Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne, in May. He was made an acting <a href="Squadron_Leader" title="wikilink">Squadron Leader</a> in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the following year.

<p>Hannah was posted to Britain in 1947, undertaking study at <a href="RAF_Staff_College,_Andover" title="wikilink">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, and serving as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.

In December 1961, Hannah was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, gaining promotion to acting <a href="Air_Vice_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Vice Marshal</a> in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963.

<h3 id="chief-of-the-air-staff">Chief of the Air Staff</h3>
<p>Hannah was promoted <a href="Air_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Marshal</a> on 1 January 1970, succeeding Air Marshal Sir <a href="Alister_Murdoch" title="wikilink">Alister Murdoch</a> as <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In March 1970, the-then <a href="Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Minister of Defence</a>, <a href="Malcolm_Fraser" title="wikilink">Malcolm Fraser</a>, commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the <a href="Royal_Australian_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Navy</a> should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. However, confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to &quot;avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the <a href="Chief_of_the_Defence_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>, <a href="Victor_Smith" title="wikilink">Admiral Sir Victor Smith</a>, to use the soon-to-be-delivered <a href="General_Dynamics_F-111" title="wikilink">F-111 bomber</a> for maritime support, among its other roles.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1971 New Year Honours.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Hannah's tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's <a href="Golden_Jubilee" title="wikilink">Golden Jubilee</a> in March–April 1971. He personally organised a fly-past of two <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">USAF</a> F-111s at <a href="air_show" title="wikilink">air shows</a> marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, Hannah was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, he was a member of the committee to choose an <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force_Memorial,_Canberra" title="wikilink">Air Force memorial</a> to be located on <a href="ANZAC_Parade,_Canberra" title="wikilink">ANZAC Parade, Canberra</a>. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to RAAF historian Dr Alan Stephens, reflected &quot;the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade &quot;somewhere between royal and navy blue&quot; that had been chosen personally by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>, to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The uniform approved by Hannah, an all-purpose middle blue suit, was the object of numerous complaints in the ensuing years, and reverted to Williams' original colour and style in 2000.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="governor">Governor</h2>
<p>Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted the <a href="Governors_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Governship of Queensland</a>, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a <a href="vice_regal" title="wikilink">vice regal</a> appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21 March.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Hannah was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force.

<p>Described as &quot;a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people, so necessary for a Governor&quot;,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Hannah was appointed <a href="Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George" title="wikilink">Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> (KCMG) in September 1972.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The same year, he was made a <a href="Venerable_Order_of_Saint_John" title="wikilink">Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John</a>. However, he created controversy at a Brisbane Chamber of Commerce luncheon in October 1975, criticising the &quot;fumbling ineptitude&quot; of <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Gough_Whitlam" title="wikilink">Gough Whitlam</a>'s Federal <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Labor</a> Government for placing Australia in &quot;its present economic state&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In response, the Federal Government advised the Queen to revoke Hannah's <a href="dormant_commission" title="wikilink">dormant commission</a> to serve in place of the <a href="Governor-General_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Governor-General</a> if the latter was absent. Following his succession as Prime Minister in November 1975, Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated, but the British Government refused to recommend this to the Queen, citing lack of impartiality on Hannah's part. Queensland premier <a href="Joh_Bjelke-Petersen" title="wikilink">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a> made it known that he planned to extend the Governor's term, but the British Government also refused to agree to this, and Hannah's tenure was permitted to lapse on 20 March 1977.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
