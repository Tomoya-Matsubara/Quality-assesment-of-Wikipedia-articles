<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>The color pink is named after the flowers called <a href="Dianthus" title="wikilink">pinks</a>, <a href="flowering_plant" title="wikilink">flowering plants</a> in the genus <em><a href="Dianthus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dianthus</a>.</em> The name derives from the frilled edge of the flowers&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="verb" class="uri" title="wikilink">verb</a> &quot;to pink&quot; dates from the 14th century and means &quot;to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern&quot; (possibly from German &quot;pinken&quot; = to peck).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As noted and referenced above, the word &quot;pink&quot; was first used as a noun to refer to the color known today as pink in the 17th century.

<h3 id="from-the-ancient-world-to-the-renaissance">From the ancient world to the Renaissance</h3>
<p>The color pink has been described in literature since ancient times; In the <a href="Odyssey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odyssey</a>, written in about 800 BCE, <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a> wrote &quot;Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared...<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Roman poets also described the color. <em><a href="wikt:roseus" title="wikilink">Roseus</a></em> is the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> word meaning &quot;<a href="Rose_(color)" title="wikilink">rosy</a>&quot; or &quot;pink.&quot; <a href="Lucretius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucretius</a> used the word to describe the <a href="dawn" class="uri" title="wikilink">dawn</a> in his <a href="Epic_poetry" title="wikilink">epic poem</a> <em>On the Nature of Things</em> (<em><a href="De_rerum_natura" title="wikilink">De rerum natura</a></em>).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Pink was not a common color in the fashion of the Middle Ages; nobles usually preferred brighter reds, such as crimson. However, it did appear sometimes in women's fashion, and in religious art. In the 13th and 14th century, in works by <a href="Cimabue" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cimabue</a> and <a href="Duccio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Duccio</a>, the Christ child was sometimes portrayed dressed in pink, the color associated with the body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the high Renaissance painting the <a href="Madonna_of_the_Pinks" title="wikilink">Madonna of the Pinks</a> by <a href="Raphael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Raphael</a>, the Christ child is presenting a <a href="pink_(flower)" title="wikilink">pink flower</a> to the <a href="Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Virgin Mary</a>. The pink was a symbol of marriage, showing a spiritual marriage between the mother and child. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Renaissance, pink was mostly used for the flesh color of faces and hands. The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese; it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called <a href="sinopia" class="uri" title="wikilink">sinopia</a>, or <a href="Venetian_red" title="wikilink">Venetian red</a>, and a white pigment called <em>Bianco San Genovese</em>, or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, <em>Il Libro Dell'Arte</em>, <a href="Cennino_Cennini" title="wikilink">Cennino Cennini</a> described it this way: &quot;The color is made of the hansomest and lightest sinoper obtainable, and it is mixed and worked up with lime white; and this white is made from very white and well-purified lime. And when these two colors are well worked up together, that is, two parts cinabrese and the third lime white, make little cakes of it, like halves of nuts, and let them dry. Whenever you need some, take what you think fit; for this color does you credit in painting countenances, hands, and nudes on the wall.&quot; <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-18th-century">The 18th century</h3>
<p>The golden age of the color pink was the <a href="Rococo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rococo</a> Period (1720&lt;U+2013&gt;1777) in the 18th century, when pastel colors became very fashionable in all the courts of Europe.

In this painting, it symbolized childhood, innocence and tenderness. Sarah Moulton was just eleven years old when the picture was painted, and died tragically the following year.</p>

<h3 id="the-19th-century">The 19th century</h3>
<p>In 19th century England, pink ribbons or decorations were often wore by small boys; boys were simply considered small men, and while men in England wore red uniforms, boys wore pink. In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes, clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water. Queen Victoria was painted in 1850 with her seventh child and third son, Prince Arthur, who wore white and pink.</p>

<p>In the 20th century, pinks became bolder, brighter and more assertive, in part because of the invention of chemical dyes which did not fade. The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian designer <a href="Elsa_Schiaparelli" title="wikilink">Elsa Schiaparelli</a>, (1890-1973) who was aligned with the artists of the <a href="surrealist" class="uri" title="wikilink">surrealist</a> movement, including <a href="Jean_Cocteau" title="wikilink">Jean Cocteau</a>.

She also created a scandal by launching a perfume of the same name, sold in a bottle in the shale of a woman's bust.

<p><a href="Ham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ham</a>, though it contains myoglobins like beef, undergoes a different transformation. Traditional hams, such as <a href="prosciutto" class="uri" title="wikilink">prosciutto</a>, are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig, covering it with sea salt, which removes the moisture content, and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years. The salt (<a href="sodium_nitrate" title="wikilink">sodium nitrate</a>) permits the ham to retain its original pink color, even when dried out. Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process; they are brined, or infused with a salt-water solution, containing <a href="sodium_nitrite" title="wikilink">sodium nitrite</a>, which transfers <a href="nitric_oxide" title="wikilink">nitric oxide</a>, which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color.</p>

<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
<p>In Europe and the United States, pink is often associated with girls, while blue is associated with boys. This distinction is relatively recent, usually dated to early in the 20th century.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Before the 20th century, European countries varied, with some assigning colors based on the baby's complexion, and others assigning pink sometimes to boys and sometimes to girls.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 1950s, pink was strongly associated with femininity&quot; but to an extent that was &quot;neither rigid nor universal&quot; as it later became.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<li>One study by two neuroscientists in <em>Current Biology</em> examined color preferences across cultures and found significant differences between male and female responses. Both groups favored blues over other hues, but women had more favorable responses to the reddish-purple range of the spectrum and men had more favorable responses to the greenish-yellow end of the spectrum. Despite the fact that the study used adults, and both groups preferred blues, and responses to the color <em>pink</em> were never even tested, the popular press represented the research as an indication of an innate preference by girls for pink. The misreading has been often repeated in market research, reinforcing American culture's association of pink with girls on the basis of imagined innate characteristics.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></li>

It is used for the Third Sunday of <a href="Advent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Advent</a> and the Fourth Sunday of <a href="Lent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lent</a> (see <a href="Laetare_Sunday" title="wikilink">Laetare Sunday</a>) to mark the halfway point in these seasons of penance. For this reason, one of the candles in an <a href="Advent_wreath" title="wikilink">Advent wreath</a> may be pink, rather than purple.</li>
<li>Pink is the color most associated with Indian spiritual leader <a href="Meher_Baba" title="wikilink">Meher Baba</a>, who often wore pink coats to please his closest female follower, Mehera Irani, and today pink remains an important color, symbolizing love, to Baba's followers.</li>

<li><a href="Toy" title="wikilink">Toys</a> aimed at girls often display pink prominently on packaging and the toy themselves. This caused concern among some fans of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</em> when Princess Celestia, white-coated in the show itself, had a toy released with her colored pink instead.</li>
<li>In its 1957 catalog, <a href="Lionel_Trains" title="wikilink">Lionel Trains</a> offered for sale a pink model <a href="freight_train" title="wikilink">freight train</a> for girls. The <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> and <a href="coal_car" title="wikilink">coal car</a> were pink and the freight cars of the freight train were various <a href="pastel_colors" title="wikilink">pastel colors</a>. The <a href="caboose" class="uri" title="wikilink">caboose</a> was <a href="baby_blue" title="wikilink">baby blue</a>. It was a marketing failure because any girl who was enough a <a href="tomboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">tomboy</a> to want a <a href="model_train" title="wikilink">model train</a> would want a real train and not a pink train, and boys in the 1950s did not want to be seen playing with a pink train.

Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, was thought to be dainty. Why or when that switched is not clear, but as late as the 1930s a significant percentage of adults in one national survey held to that split.&quot;<a href="#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
