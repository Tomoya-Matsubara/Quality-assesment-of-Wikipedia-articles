Arup, Consulting Engineers by <a href="Ove_Arup" title="wikilink">Sir Ove Nyquist Arup</a>. Sir Ove set out to build a firm where professionals of diverse disciplines could work together to produce projects of greater quality than was achievable than by them working in isolation. The firm was later reformed as &quot;Ove Arup &amp; Partners&quot; with partners Ronald Jenkins, Geoffrey Wood and Andrew Young.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s and 1950s the firm undertook work around the UK, including the <a href="Brynmawr_Rubber_Factory" title="wikilink">Brynmawr Rubber Factory</a> and <a href="Coventry_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Coventry Cathedral</a>, as well as significant work in Africa.</p>
<p>In <a href="1956" class="uri" title="wikilink">1956</a> <a href="Peter_Thomas_Dunican" title="wikilink">Peter Dunican</a>, later the Chairman of Arup and the President of the <a href="Institution_of_Structural_Engineers" title="wikilink">Institution of Structural Engineers</a> was appointed as a partner.</p>
<p>In <a href="1957" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957</a> the firm started working on the design of the new <a href="Sydney_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Sydney Opera House</a> with the architect <a href="Jorn_Utzon" title="wikilink">Jorn Utzon</a>.</p>
<p>Further partners appointed were Ronald Hobbs in <a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a> and <a href="Povl_Ahm" title="wikilink">Povl Ahm</a> and <a href="Jack_Zunz" title="wikilink">Jack Zunz</a> in <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a></p>
<p>In <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>, together with the architect <a href="Philip_Dowson" title="wikilink">Philip Dowson</a>, Arup Associates was formed to offer multi-disciplinary architectural and engineering services. Philip Dowson did not become a partner until <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>, after the firm was reformed again as &quot;Ove Arup &amp; Partners Consulting Engineers and Arup Associates&quot; in <a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>. In <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a> the firm was again re-organised, with the &quot;Ove Arup Partnership&quot; becoming the parent company of &quot;Ove Arup &amp; Partners&quot; and &quot;Arup Associates&quot;. In the same year Ove Arup delivered what is known as &quot;The Key Speech&quot;, a speech setting out the values of Arup.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>By <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a> the firm reached 1500 employees. In the same year, the <a href="Sydney_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Sydney Opera House</a> was finally opened, 16 years after the firm first started working on it.</p>
<p>In <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>, with the original partners nearing retirement, the firm was again reconstituted, with all of Ove Arup Partnership's equity owned by a trust for the benefit of its staff.</p>
<p>In <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a> Ove Arup died, and in <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a> &quot;The Ove Arup Foundation&quot; was established in his memory.
