<p>State Route 242 is nestled entirely within the northeastern quadrant of <a href="Darke_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Darke County</a>. State Route 242 is not inclusive in the <a href="National_Highway_System_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Highway System</a>, a system of highways deemed most important for the country's economy, defense and mobility.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>State Route 242 begins at the rural <a href="Richland_Township,_Darke_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Richland Township</a> intersection of <a href="U.S._Route_127_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 127</a> and Reed Road. The vast majority of the state highway passes through farmland, with the occasional home appearing along the way. Heading due east from the U.S. Route 127 intersection, State Route 242 immediately intersects Greenville-St. Marys Road, then proceeds among the vastness of crops, meeting Schroder Road and Younker Road en route arriving at the Horner Road intersection. Here, State Route 242 turns north onto the alignment of Horner Road, with the road continuing east from the intersection being Chase Road. As it heads northward, State Route 242 now passes by the western edge of <a href="Darke_County_Airport" title="wikilink">Darke County Airport</a>. The state route next arrives at its intersection with Plessinger Road. At this point, State Route 242 turns east again, with the road heading north from this intersection becoming known as Shaffer Road. Running due east along the north side of the county airport, State Route 242 passes into <a href="Wayne_Township,_Darke_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Wayne Township</a> prior to arriving at its endpoint at its junction with <a href="Ohio_State_Route_121" title="wikilink">State Route 121</a>, where the intersecting state highway forms the southern and eastern legs of the T-interesction.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
