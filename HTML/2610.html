<p><strong>Toothache</strong> (also termed <strong>dental pain</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <strong>odontalgia</strong>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <strong>dentalgia</strong>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <strong>odontodynia</strong>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or <strong>odontogenic pain</strong>),<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> is <a href="pain" class="uri" title="wikilink">pain</a> in the <a href="teeth" class="uri" title="wikilink">teeth</a> and/or their supporting structures, caused by <a href="dental_disease" title="wikilink">dental diseases</a> or <a href="referred_pain" title="wikilink">pain referred</a> to the teeth by non-dental diseases.</p>
<p>Common causes include <a href="pulpitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">pulpitis</a> (<a href="inflammation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflammation</a> of the <a href="Pulp_(tooth)" title="wikilink">pulp</a>, usually a response to <a href="dental_caries" title="wikilink">dental caries</a> (tooth decay), <a href="dental_trauma" title="wikilink">dental trauma</a> or other factors), <a href="dentin_hypersensitivity" title="wikilink">dentin hypersensitivity</a> (short, sharp pain usually associated with exposed <a href="Dental_anatomy#Crown_and_root" title="wikilink">root</a> surfaces), <a href="apical_periodontitis" title="wikilink">apical periodontitis</a> (inflammation of the <a href="periodontal_ligament" title="wikilink">periodontal ligament</a> and <a href="alveolar_bone" title="wikilink">alveolar bone</a> around the root apex), <a href="dental_abscess" title="wikilink">dental abscesses</a> (localized collections of <a href="pus" class="uri" title="wikilink">pus</a>, e.g. <a href="periapical_abscess" title="wikilink">apical abscess</a>, <a href="pericoronal_abscess" title="wikilink">pericoronal abscess</a> and <a href="periodontal_abscess" title="wikilink">periodontal abscess</a>), <a href="alveolar_osteitis" title="wikilink">alveolar osteitis</a> (&quot;dry socket&quot;, a possible complication of <a href="dental_extraction" title="wikilink">tooth extraction</a> where there is loss of the <a href="thrombus" title="wikilink">blood clot</a> and exposure of bone), <a href="acute_necrotizing_ulcerative_gingivitis" title="wikilink">acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis</a> (a gum infection, also called &quot;trenchmouth&quot;), and others.</p>
<p>Pulpitis is classified as reversible, when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts for a short time after a stimulus (e.g. cold, sweet); or irreversible where the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, and then progress to <a href="pulp_necrosis" title="wikilink">pulp necrosis</a> (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute <a href="pericoronitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">pericoronitis</a> of a lower <a href="wisdom_tooth" title="wikilink">wisdom tooth</a>, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of <a href="chronic_periodontitis" title="wikilink">chronic periodontitis</a> (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as <a href="sinusitis" title="wikilink">maxillary sinusitis</a> which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or <a href="angina_pectoris" title="wikilink">angina pectoris</a> which can cause pain in the lower teeth.</p>
<p>The treatment of toothache depends on the exact cause, and may involve a <a href="dental_restoration" title="wikilink">filling</a>, <a href="root_canal_treatment" title="wikilink">root canal treatment</a>, <a href="tooth_extraction" title="wikilink">extraction</a>, drainage of pus, etc.</p>
<p>Toothache is the most common type of <a href="orofacial_pain" title="wikilink">orofacial pain</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and when severe it is considered a <a href="dental_emergency" title="wikilink">dental emergency</a> since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating and daily activities. It is one of most common reasons for emergency dental appointments.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Correct diagnosis of the cause of toothache can sometimes be challenging. Since the causes of toothache are varied, the treatment is dependent upon the exact cause. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of <a href="dentist" title="wikilink">dentists</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of <a href="dentistry" title="wikilink">dental surgery</a> as the first specialty of medicine.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>

<p>Teeth are composed of an outer shell of <a href="calcification" title="wikilink">calcified</a> hard <a href="Tissue_(biology)" title="wikilink">tissues</a> (from hardest to softest: <a href="Tooth_enamel" title="wikilink">enamel</a>, <a href="dentin" class="uri" title="wikilink">dentin</a> and <a href="cementum" class="uri" title="wikilink">cementum</a>), and an inner <a href="soft_tissue" title="wikilink">soft tissue</a> core (the pulp system), containing <a href="nerve" title="wikilink">nerves</a> and <a href="blood_vessel" title="wikilink">blood vessels</a>. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth are the crowns (covered by enamel) and the anchoring parts in the bone are the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms the bulk of the tooth, surrounding the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the <a href="pulp_chamber" title="wikilink">pulp chamber</a>, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are <a href="root_canal" title="wikilink">root canals</a>, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The <a href="periodontal_ligament" title="wikilink">periodontal ligament</a> connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Enamel is not a vital tissue (i.e. it lacks blood vessels, nerves and living cells).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Consequently, pathologic processes involving only enamel (e.g. a shallow cavity or crack) tend to be painless.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Dentin contains many microscopic tubes (dentin tubules) containing fluid and the processes of <a href="odontoblast" class="uri" title="wikilink">odontoblast</a> cells, which communicate with the pulp. Mechanical, osmotic or other stimuli cause movement of this fluid, triggering nerves in the pulp (the &quot;hydrodynamic theory&quot; of pulp sensitivity).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Due to the close relationship between dentin and pulp, they are frequently considered together as the <em>dentin-pulp complex</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The teeth and gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are generally sharp, lasting as long as the stimulus.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In toothache, nerves are stimulated by either <a href="exogenous" class="uri" title="wikilink">exogenous</a> sources (e.g. <a href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacterial</a> toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, trauma), or <a href="endogenous" class="uri" title="wikilink">endogenous</a> factors (e.g. <a href="inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammatory mediators</a>).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The pain pathway is mostly transmitted via <a href="myelin" title="wikilink">myelinated</a> <a href="A_delta_fiber" title="wikilink">A&lt;U+03B4&gt;</a> (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated <a href="Group_C_nerve_fiber" title="wikilink">C</a> <a href="nerve_fiber" title="wikilink">nerve fibers</a> (slow, dull, aching or burning pain), of the <a href="trigeminal_nerve" title="wikilink">trigeminal nerve</a>, supplying sensation to the teeth and gums via many divisions and branches.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (e.g. cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (<a href="allodynia" class="uri" title="wikilink">allodynia</a>). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (<a href="hyperalgesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">hyperalgesia</a>). The physical component of pain is processed in the <a href="brainstem" title="wikilink">medullary spinal cord</a> and perceived in the <a href="frontal_cortex" title="wikilink">frontal cortex</a>, however, pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, making individual response to identical stimuli variable.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
<p>Toothache may be caused by <em>dental</em> (<em>odontogenic</em>) conditions (i.e. those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by <em>non-dental</em> (<em>non-odontogenic</em>) conditions (e.g. <a href="sinusitis" title="wikilink">maxillary sinusitis</a>, <a href="angina_pectoris" title="wikilink">angina pectoris</a>). There are many possible non-dental causes, but the vast majority of toothache is dental in origin.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Both the pulp and periodontal ligament have <a href="nociceptor" title="wikilink">nociceptors</a> (pain receptors),<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> but the pulp lacks <a href="proprioceptor" title="wikilink">proprioceptors</a> (motion or position receptors) and <a href="mechanoreceptor" title="wikilink">mechanoreceptors</a> (mechanical pressure receptors).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex tends to be poorly localized,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> although not always.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>For instance, the periodontal ligament can detect the pressure exerted when biting on something smaller than a grain of <a href="sand" class="uri" title="wikilink">sand</a> (10-30 &lt;U+00B5&gt;m).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> When a tooth is intentionally stimulated about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down to a group of three teeth.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="pulpal">Pulpal</h4>
<p>The majority of pulpal toothache falls into one of the types below; however, other rare causes which do not always fit neatly into these categories include <a href="galvanic_pain" title="wikilink">galvanic pain</a> and <a href="barodontalgia" class="uri" title="wikilink">barodontalgia</a>.</p>
<h5 id="pulpitis">Pulpitis</h5>
<p><a href="Pulpitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pulpitis</a> (inflammation of the pulp) can be triggered by various stimuli (insults), e.g. mechanical, thermal, chemical and bacterial irritants, or rarely <a href="Aerodontalgia" title="wikilink">barometric changes</a> and <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (e.g. a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal.</p>
<p>The pulp is encased in a rigid outer shell, so when the pulp is inflamed there is no space to accommodate any swelling. This increases pressure in the pulp system, and the blood vessels which supply the pulp may become compressed, leading to <a href="ischemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ischemia</a> (lack of oxygen) and <a href="necrosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">necrosis</a> (tissue death). Pulpitis is termed <em>reversible</em> when an inflamed pulp is capable of returning to a state of health, and <em>irreversible</em> when the level of inflammation has past the point of no return and <a href="pulp_necrosis" title="wikilink">pulp necrosis</a> is inevitable.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Reversible pulpitis is characterized by short-lasting pain to cold and sometimes heat.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed (e.g. dental decay removed and a filling placed), or the odontoblasts lay down tertiary dentin to insulate against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous pain or lingering pain to cold.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="dentin-hypersensitivity">Dentin hypersensitivity</h5>
<p><a href="Dentin_hypersensitivity" title="wikilink">Dentin hypersensitivity</a> is a sharp, short lasting dental pain occurring in about 15% of the population,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> which is triggered by cold (liquids, air), sweet or spicy foods and drinks.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Teeth will normally have some sensation to these triggers,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> but what separates hypersensitivity from regular tooth sensation is the intensity of the pain. Hypersensitivity is most commonly caused by a lack of insulation from the triggers in the mouth due to <a href="gingival_recession" title="wikilink">gingival recession</a> (receding gums) exposing the roots of the teeth, although it can occur after <a href="scaling_and_root_planing" title="wikilink">scaling and root planing</a> or <a href="dental_bleaching" title="wikilink">dental bleaching</a> or as a result of <a href="Acid_erosion" title="wikilink">erosion</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The pulp of the tooth remains normal and healthy in dentin hypersensitivity.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Many topical treatments for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Treatment of the <a href="root_cause" title="wikilink">root cause</a> is critical as topical measures are typically short lasting,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="periodontal">Periodontal</h4>
<p>Generally, chronic periodontal conditions do not cause any pain and it is acute inflammation which is responsible.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="apical-periodontitis">Apical periodontitis</h5>
<p><img src="Abscessed_tooth_periapical_radiograph.jpg" title="fig:Apical abscess associated with roots of a lower molar." alt="Apical abscess associated with roots of a lower molar." /> <a href="Apical_periodontitis" title="wikilink">Apical periodontitis</a> is the <a href="immune_response" title="wikilink">immune response</a> to bacteria, bacterial toxins and necrotic tissue within an infected pulp. These <a href="cytotoxin" title="wikilink">cytotoxins</a> reach the periapical region (i.e. the region around the roots of the tooth) via the communicating apertures of the apical delta and the lateral canals of the pulp canal system. There is <a href="vasodilation" class="uri" title="wikilink">vasodilation</a>, sensitization of nerves and <a href="osteolysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteolysis</a> (bone resorption). As the periodontal ligament is now inflamed, the tooth usually becomes painful to bite on and when tapped, and may even be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Acute apical periodontitis is typically characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> There may also be tenderness to <a href="palpation" class="uri" title="wikilink">palpation</a> of the alveolar process over the apices. Bone resporption causes the classic radiographic appearance of a tooth with a radiolucent area around the end of the root.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Generally speaking, apical periodontitis is a development which follows irreversible pulpitis, or pulpal necrosis secondary to pulpitis. However, apical periodontitis does not occur because of pulp necrosis, but because of pulp infection; therefore, a dental pulp that tests as if it's alive (vital) can still have symptoms of apical periodontitis and a dental pulp that is dead (non-vital) as a result of a <a href="Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="wikilink">sterile</a>, non-infectious processes (as may occur with trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> If an abscess forms, terms like <em>apical abscess</em> or <em>dentoalveolar abscess</em> are often used instead of apical periodontitis.</p>
<h5 id="food-impaction">Food impaction</h5>
<p>Food packing is where food debris becomes trapped between two teeth, and is pushed into the gums as more food becomes trapped on top of the original. This irritates the gums, causing localized discomfort or mild pain and a feeling of pressure from between the two teeth. The gingival papilla appears swollen and is tender and bleeds when touched. The usual cause of food impaction between teeth is disruption of the normal interproximal contour of teeth (i.e. the embrasure), caused by dental decay which has led to a collapse of part of the tooth, or a poorly shaped dental restoration (e.g. crown, filling) which fails to accurately reproduce the contact point. As a result, there is a gap which leads to food being pushed down between the teeth during chewing. Fibrous food is especially likely to become trapped in this manner (e.g. meat). Classically, dental pain caused by food packing occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This is different from the &quot;meal time syndrome&quot; pattern of pain of certain <a href="salivary_gland_disease" title="wikilink">salivary gland diseases</a>. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation (see below).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="periodontal-abscess">Periodontal abscess</h5>
<p><img src="Cracked_tooth_lateral_periodontal_abscess.jpg" title="fig:Lateral periodontal abscess (blue arrows) due to a fracture (green arrows)" alt="Lateral periodontal abscess (blue arrows) due to a fracture (green arrows)" /> A <a href="periodontal_abscess" title="wikilink">periodontal abscess</a> (lateral abscess) is a collection of pus that forms in the <a href="gingival_sulcus" title="wikilink">gingival crevices</a>, usually as a result of chronic periodontitis where the pockets are pathologically deepened greater than 3mm. A healthy gingival pocket will contain bacteria and some <a href="calculus_(dental)" title="wikilink">calculus</a> kept in check by the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a>. As the pocket deepens, the balance is disrupted, and an acute inflammatory response results, forming pus. The debris and swelling then disrupt the normal flow of fluids into and out of the pocket, rapidly accelerating the inflammatory cycle. Larger pockets also have a greater likelihood of collecting food debris, creating additional sources of infection.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Periodontal abscesses are less common than apical abscesses but still frequent, the key difference being that the pulp of the tooth tends to be alive, and will respond normally to pulp tests. However an untreated periodontal abscess, may still cause the pulp to die if it reaches the tooth apex in a <a href="periodontic-endodontic_lesion" title="wikilink">periodontic-endodontic lesion</a>. Examples of how a periodontal abscess can occur are tooth fracture, food packing into a periodontal pocket (with poorly shaped fillings), calculus build-up and lowered immune responses (such as in <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>). Periodontal abscess can also occur after periodontal scaling, which causes the gums to tighten around the teeth and trap debris in the pocket.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Toothache caused by a periodontal abscess is generally deep and throbbing. The <a href="oral_mucosa" title="wikilink">oral mucosa</a> covering an early periodontal abscess appears <a href="erythema" title="wikilink">erythematous</a> (red), <a href="Swelling_(medical)" title="wikilink">swollen</a>, shiny and <a href="hyperalgesia" title="wikilink">painful to touch</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> A variant of the periodontal abscess is the gingival abscess which is limited to the gingival margin, has a quicker onset and is typically caused by trauma from items such as a fishbone, toothpick or toothbrush rather than chronic periodontitis.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The treatment of periodontal abscess is similar to the management of dental abscesses generally (see: <a href="Toothache#Treatment" title="wikilink">Treatment</a>), however since the tooth is typically alive, there is no difficult to access source of infection, and therefore antibiotics are more routinely used in conjunction with <a href="scaling_and_root_planing" title="wikilink">scaling and root planing</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The occurrence of a periodontal abscess usually indicates advanced periodontal disease which requires correct management to prevent recurrent abscesses, e.g. daily cleaning below the gumline to prevent the build-up of subgingival plaque and calculus.</p>
<h5 id="acute-necrotizing-ulcerative-gingivitis">Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis</h5>
<p><img src="Ulcerative_necrotizing_gingivitis.jpg" title="fig:Mild presentation of ANUG on the gums of the lower front teeth" alt="Mild presentation of ANUG on the gums of the lower front teeth" /> Common marginal <a href="gingivitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">gingivitis</a> in response to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis can develop, often suddenly, termed <a href="acute_necrotizing_ulcerative_gingivitis" title="wikilink">acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis</a> (ANUG). It is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums and &quot;punched out&quot; ulceration and loss of the <a href="dental_papilla" title="wikilink">interdental papillae</a>, and possibly also <a href="halitosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">halitosis</a> (bad breath) and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress and immunosuppression.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (e.g. students in a dormitory during a period of examination).<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> ANUG is treated over several visits, first with <a href="debridement" class="uri" title="wikilink">debridement</a> of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with antiseptic mouthwases (e.g. <a href="hydrogen_peroxide" title="wikilink">hydrogen peroxide</a> or <a href="chlorhexidine" class="uri" title="wikilink">chlorhexidine</a>), analgesics and when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home.

<h5 id="pericoronitis">Pericoronitis</h5>

<p><a href="Pericoronitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pericoronitis</a> is inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is therefore more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and frequently there is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which is an area that is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> There may be <a href="trismus" class="uri" title="wikilink">trismus</a> (difficulty opening the mouth),<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and facial swelling, and <a href="rubor" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubor</a>, of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early twenties,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Acute treatment is by cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction, or less commonly the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="occlusal-trauma">Occlusal trauma</h5>
<p>Occlusal trauma is when excessive biting forces are exerted on teeth, which overloads the peridontal ligament causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with <a href="bruxism" class="uri" title="wikilink">bruxism</a>, the <a href="parafunctional_habit" title="wikilink">parafunctional</a> (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, there may be <a href="attrition_(dental)" title="wikilink">attrition</a> (<a href="tooth_wear" title="wikilink">tooth wear</a>), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the <a href="alveolar_bone" title="wikilink">alveolar bone</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Occlusal trauma often occurs when a newly placed <a href="dental_restoration" title="wikilink">dental restoration</a> is built too &quot;high&quot;, concentrating the biting forces on one tooth. Height differences measuring less than a millimeter can cause pain. Dentists therefore routinely check that any new restoration is in harmony with the bite and that forces are distributed correctly over many teeth using <a href="articulating_paper" title="wikilink">articulating paper</a>. If the high spot is quickly eliminated, the pain disappears and no permanent harm results.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Over-tightening of <a href="Dental_braces" title="wikilink">braces</a> can cause periodontal pain and occasionally a periodontal abscess.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="alveolar-osteitis">Alveolar osteitis</h5>
<p><a href="Alveolar_osteitis" title="wikilink">Alveolar osteitis</a> is a complication of tooth extraction (most commonly lower wisdom teeth) where the blood clot is not formed or lost from the empty socket (where the tooth used to be), and bare bone is exposed to the mouth.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts 2&lt;U+2013&gt;4 days after the extraction, and may last 10&lt;U+2013&gt;40 days.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local sedative dressings, which are typically required for 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7 days.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> There is some evidence of a preventive effect from rinsing with an antimicrobital rinse prior to extractions.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

Extracted (right)." /> <a href="Cracked_tooth_syndrome" title="wikilink">Cracked tooth syndrome</a> refers to a highly variable<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The term is falling into disfavor and has given way to the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth, can involve the enamel, dentin and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible) or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth it's highly suggestive of the disorder.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> or seen on radiographs as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>When toothache results from <a href="dental_trauma" title="wikilink">dental trauma</a> (regardless of the exact pulpal or periodontal diagnosis), the treatment and prognosis is dependent on the extent of damage to the tooth, the stage of development of the tooth, the degree of displacement or, when the tooth is avulsed, the time out of the socket and the starting health of the tooth and bone. Because of the high variation in treatment and prognosis, dentists often use trauma guides to help determine prognosis and direct treatment decisions.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The prognosis for a cracked tooth varies with the extent of the fracture. Those cracks that are irritating the pulp but do not extend through the pulp chamber can be amenable to stabilizing dental restorations such as a crown or composite resin. Should the fracture extend though the pulp chamber and into the root, the prognosis of the tooth is hopeless.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="periodontic-endodontic-lesion">Periodontic-endodontic lesion</h5>
<p>Apical abscesses can spread to involve periodontal pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen at the bottom of the tooth. Such lesions are termed <a href="Combined_periodontic-endodontic_lesions" title="wikilink">periodontic-endodontic lesions</a>, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Generally, the long term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.</p>
<h3 id="non-dental-causes">Non-dental causes</h3>
<p><img src="Angina_pectoris.png" title="fig:Discomfort caused by coronary artery disease can radiate to the neck, lower jaw and teeth" alt="Discomfort caused by coronary artery disease can radiate to the neck, lower jaw and teeth" />  Non-odontogenic (non-dental) causes of toothache are much less common compared to odontogenic toothache. Neurovascular origin toothache, where pain is reported in the teeth in conjunction with a <a href="migraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">migraine</a>. Local and distant structures (e.g. ear, brain, <a href="carotid_artery" title="wikilink">carotid artery</a> or heart) can also <a href="referred_pain" title="wikilink">refer pain</a> to the teeth.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Other examples include <a href="myofascial_pain" title="wikilink">myofascial pain</a> (muscle pain) and <a href="angina_pectoris" title="wikilink">angina pectoris</a> (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw).

The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is also very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary <a href="sinusitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">sinusitis</a> can be perceived as maxillary toothache,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> and neoplasms of the sinus (e.g. <a href="adenoid_cystic_carcinoma" title="wikilink">adenoid cystic carcinoma</a>),<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon <a href="Valsalva_maneuver" title="wikilink">Valsalva maneuvers</a> or tilting the head forwards.

Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed <a href="atypical_odontalgia" title="wikilink">atypical odontalgia</a>, which in turn is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain).<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, e.g. pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (e.g. from the left teeth to the right teeth).</p>
<p>Establishing a diagnosis of nondental toothache is initially done by careful questioning about the site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors and referral of the pain, then ruling out any dental causes. There are no specific treatments for nondental pain (each treatment is directed at the cause of the pain, rather than the toothache itself) but a dentist can assist in offering potential sources of the pain and direct the patient to appropriate care. The most critical nondental source is the radiation of <a href="angina_pectoris" title="wikilink">angina pectoris</a> into the lower teeth and the potential need for urgent cardiac care.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diagnostic-approach">Diagnostic approach</h2>
<p>The diagnosis of toothache can be challenging,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> as the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> However, the vast majority of toothache comes from dental, rather than non-dental, sources.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Consequently, the saying &quot;<a href="horses,_not_zebras" title="wikilink">horses, not zebras</a>&quot; has been applied to the <a href="differential_diagnosis" title="wikilink">differential diagnosis</a> of orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, it has been suggested that all cases of orofacial pain be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: <a href="Medical_history" title="wikilink">history</a>, followed by <a href="Physical_examination" title="wikilink">examination</a> and <a href="medical_test" title="wikilink">investigations</a>. All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>The <a href="chief_complaint" title="wikilink">chief complaint</a>, and the history of the complaint are usually very important in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, i.e. pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. Other examples of where the history is important include a history of recent filling or other dental treatment, trauma to the teeth, etc. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain and factors that make the pain worse.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a>The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, e.g. using the <a href="Socrates_(pain_assessment)" title="wikilink">Socrates pain assessment method</a> (see table). From the history, indicators of pulpal, periodontal, a combination of both or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset and associated with bleeding and pain with brushing. More than one factor may be involved in the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause of combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis (and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold).<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Non-dental sources of pain often cause multiple teeth to hurt and have an epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, it is possible that dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark is that there is no obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.</p>
<p>Irreversible pulpitis progresses to pulp necrosis, wherein the nerves are non functional and a pain free period following the severe pain of irreversible pulpitis may be experienced. However, it is common for irreversible pulpitis to progress to apical periodontitis, including an acute apical abscess, without treatment. As irreversible pulpitis generates an apical abscess, the character of the toothache may simply change without any pain free period, i.e. the pain becomes well localized, and biting on the tooth becomes painful. Hot drinks can make the tooth feel worse because they expand the gases and likewise, cold can make it feel better.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="examination">Examination</h3>
<p>The clinical examination narrows the source down to a specific tooth, teeth or a non-dental cause. Clinical examination moves from the outside to the inside and from the general to the specific. Extra-orally (outside of the mouth), the <a href="Paranasal_sinuses" title="wikilink">sinuses</a>, muscles of the <a href="Muscles_of_mastication" title="wikilink">face</a> and <a href="Sternocleidomastoid_muscle" title="wikilink">neck</a>, the <a href="temporomandibular_joint" title="wikilink">temporomandibular joints</a> and <a href="cervical_lymph_node" title="wikilink">cervical lymph nodes</a> are palpated for pain or swelling.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Intraorally (in the mouth), the soft tissues of the <a href="gingiva" class="uri" title="wikilink">gingiva</a>, <a href="mucosa" class="uri" title="wikilink">mucosa</a>, <a href="tongue" class="uri" title="wikilink">tongue</a> and <a href="pharynx" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharynx</a> are examined for redness, swelling or deformity. Finally, the teeth are examined. Each tooth that may be painful is percussed (tapped), palpated (at the base of the root), probed with a <a href="dental_explorer" title="wikilink">dental explorer</a> for <a href="dental_caries" title="wikilink">dental caries</a> and a periodontal probe for <a href="periodontitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">periodontitis</a> then wiggled for mobility.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes the symptoms reported in the history are misleading, and point the examiner in the wrong area of the mouth. E.g., sometimes people may mistake pain from pulpitis in a lower tooth as pain in the upper teeth, and <em>vice versa</em>. In other instances, the apparent examination findings may be misleading and lead to the wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. E.g. pus from a pericoronal abscess associated with a lower third molar may track in the submucosal plane and discharge as a <a href="parulis" class="uri" title="wikilink">parulis</a> over the roots of the teeth towards the front of the mouth (&quot;migratory abscess&quot;). Another example is decay of the tooth root which is hidden from view below the gumline, giving the casual appearance of a sound tooth if careful periodontal examination is not carried out.</p>
<p>Factors indicating infection include fluctuance (movement of fluid in the tissues during palpation), <a href="cervical_lymphadenopathy" title="wikilink">cervical lymphadenopathy</a> (swollen <a href="lymph_node" title="wikilink">lymph nodes</a> in the neck) and <a href="fever" class="uri" title="wikilink">fever</a> (oral temperature &gt;37.7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C).</p>
<h3 id="investigations">Investigations</h3>
<p>Any tooth that is identified, in either the history of pain or base clinical exam, as a source for toothache may undergo further testing for vitality of the dental pulp, infection, fractures or periodontitis. These tests can include:<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pulp sensitivity tests, usually carried out with a cotton wool pledget sprayed with <a href="ethyl_chloride" title="wikilink">ethyl chloride</a> to serve as a cold stimulus, or with an <a href="electric_pulp_test" title="wikilink">electric pulp tester</a>. The air spray from a 3 in 1 syringe can also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot <a href="Gutta-percha" title="wikilink">gutta-percha.</a> A healthy tooth will feel the cold but the pain will be mild and gone once the stimulus is removed. The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing and 71% for heat testing. Because of the lack of <a href="test_sensitivity" title="wikilink">test sensitivity</a>, a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis.</li>
<li><a href="Radiograph" title="wikilink">Radiographs</a> utilized to find <a href="dental_caries" title="wikilink">dental caries</a> and bone loss laterally or at the apex.</li>
<li>Assessment of biting on individual teeth (sometimes helps to localize the problem) or the separate cusps (may help to detect cracked cusp syndrome).</li>
</ul>
<p>Less commonly used tests might include trans-illumination (e.g. to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight a crack in a tooth), dyes (also to help visualize a crack), a test cavity , selective anaesthesia and <a href="Laser_Doppler_velocimetry" title="wikilink">laser doppler flowmetry</a>.</p>

Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day. Below, deformation on the third day." alt="Odontogenic infection involving the buccal space. Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day. Below, deformation on the third day." />  There are many causes of toothache and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Before this, since many cases of toothache are inflammatory in nature, <a href="Over-the-counter_drug" title="wikilink">over the counter</a> <a href="non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug" title="wikilink">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a> (NSAIDs) may help (unless <a href="contraindication" title="wikilink">contraindicated</a>, e.g. <a href="peptic_ulcer" title="wikilink">peptic ulcer</a>). Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as <a href="aspirin" class="uri" title="wikilink">aspirin</a> alone or in combination with <a href="codeine" class="uri" title="wikilink">codeine</a>.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when <a href="acetaminophen" class="uri" title="wikilink">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental <a href="overdose" class="uri" title="wikilink">overdose</a> is more likely to occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the <a href="oral_mucosa" title="wikilink">oral mucosa</a> caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing <a href="eugenol" class="uri" title="wikilink">eugenol</a> (such as <a href="Oil_of_cloves" title="wikilink">clove oil</a>) against the gum.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, however an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.</p>
<p>For the dentist, generally, the goal of treatment is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on the cause of the toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as <a href="lidocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">lidocaine</a> and <a href="epinephrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">epinephrine</a> is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a <a href="dental_drill" title="wikilink">dental drill</a> and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction or debridement.</p>
<h3 id="management-of-pulpitis-and-its-sequalae">Management of pulpitis and its sequalae</h3>
<p>In pulpitis, an important distinction with regards treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp to return to a state of health,<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. Generally, there is no difference in outcomes whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The field of <a href="regenerative_endodontics" title="wikilink">regenerative endodontics</a> is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a distinct concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma to the point that it is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.</p>
<h3 id="management-of-dental-abscesses">Management of dental abscesses</h3>
<p>A general principle concerning dental abscesses is <em><a href="ubi_pus,_ibi_evacua" title="wikilink">ubi pus, ibi evacua</a></em> (&quot;where there is pus, drain it&quot;), which applies to any case where there is a collection of pus in the tissues (e.g. a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess or apical abscess). The tissues are typically stretched and tense because of the deformation caused by pus. This causes throbbing, constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeed or they are impossible, <a href="incision_and_drainage" title="wikilink">incision and drainage</a> may be required, where a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and they are opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad taste (pus tastes offensive).</p>
<h3 id="antibiotics">Antibiotics</h3>
<p>Antibiotics tend to be extensively used for emergency dental problems.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> As samples for microbiologic <a href="culture_and_sensitivity" title="wikilink">culture and sensitivity</a> are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, <a href="broad-spectrum_antibiotic" title="wikilink">broad-spectrum antibiotics</a> such as <a href="amoxicillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">amoxicillin</a> are typically used for a short course of about 3 to 7 days.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Antibiotics are seen as a &quot;quick fix&quot; by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies; and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments such as tooth extraction which are perceived negatively. It has been estimated that 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, and this is seen as a major factor in <a href="antibiotic_resistance" title="wikilink">antibiotic resistance</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> They are often used inappropriately,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> e.g. in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> apical abscess,<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> dry socket,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> and mild pericoronitis.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> The reality is however that antibiotics are rarely needed,<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> and they should be used restrictively in dentistry.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Local measures such as incision and drainage and removal of the cause of the infection (e.g. a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important,<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and if drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Antibiotics tend to be used when local measures cannot be carried out immediately.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> In this role antibiotics suppress the infection until local measures can be carried out, e.g. severe trismus may occur in when the <a href="muscles_of_mastication" title="wikilink">muscles of mastication</a> are involved in an odontogenic infection, making any surgical treatment impossible. <a href="Immunocompromised" class="uri" title="wikilink">Immunocompromised</a> individuals (e.g. <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>), are less able to fight off infections, and antibiotics are usually given.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Evidence of systemic involvement (e.g. fever higher than 38.5&lt;U+00B0&gt;C, cervical lymphadenopathy, <a href="malaise" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaise</a>) also indicates antibiotic therapy, as do rapidly spreading infections, <a href="cellulitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cellulitis</a>, or severe pericoronitis.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> <a href="Drooling" class="uri" title="wikilink">Drooling</a>, <a href="dysphagia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysphagia</a> (difficulty swallowing) are signs that the airway may be threatened, and may precede <a href="dyspnoea" class="uri" title="wikilink">dyspnoea</a> (difficulty breathing). <a href="Ludwig&#39;s_angina" title="wikilink">Ludwig's angina</a> and <a href="cavernous_sinus_thrombosis" title="wikilink">cavernous sinus thrombosis</a> are rare but serious complications of odontogenic infections. Severe infections tend to be managed in hospital.</p>
<h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
<p>Most dental pain can be treated with routine dentistry. In rare cases, toothache can be a symptom representing a life-threatening condition such as a deep neck infection (compression of the <a href="airway" class="uri" title="wikilink">airway</a> by a spreading <a href="odontogenic_infection" title="wikilink">odontogenic infection</a>) or something more remote like a <a href="Myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">heart attack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Dental_caries" title="wikilink">Dental caries</a>, left untreated, follows a predictable <a href="Natural_history_of_disease" title="wikilink">natural history</a> as it nears the pulp of the tooth. First it causes reversible pulpitis which transitions to irreversible pulpitis, then to necrosis, then to necrosis with periapical periodontitis and finally to necrosis with periapical abscess. Reversible pulpitis can be stopped by removal of the <a href="dental_caries" title="wikilink">cavity</a> and the placement of a <a href="pulp_capping" title="wikilink">sedative dressing</a> of the any part of the cavity that is near the pulp chamber. Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated with either root canal therapy or extraction. Infection of the periapical tissue will generally resolve with the treatment of the pulp, unless it has expanded to <a href="cellulitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cellulitis</a> or a <a href="radicular_cyst" title="wikilink">radicular cyst</a>. The success rate of restorative treatment and sedative dressings in reversible pulpitis, depends on the extent of disease as well as several technical factors, such as the sedative agent used and whether a rubber dam was used. The success rate of root canal treatment also depends on the degree of disease (root canal therapy for irreversible pulpitis, generally, has higher success rates than necrosis with periapical abscess) as well as many more technical factors.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>Since most toothache is the result of <a href="dental_plaque" title="wikilink">plaque-related diseases</a> such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a <a href="cariogenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">cariogenic</a> diet (i.e. a diet high in frequent consumption of refined sugars) and maintenance of good <a href="oral_hygiene" title="wikilink">oral hygiene</a> (e.g. brushing the teeth twice per day with fluoride toothpaste and <a href="flossing" class="uri" title="wikilink">flossing</a>). Regular attendance at a dentist for check ups also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of <a href="mouthguard" title="wikilink">mouthguards</a> in <a href="contact_sport" title="wikilink">contact sports</a>.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology</h2>
<p>Toothache may occur at any age, in either sex and in any geographic region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people attend for emergency dental treatment.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependant upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status and exposure to fluoride (i.e. areas without <a href="water_fluoridation" title="wikilink">water fluoridation</a>).<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the 6 months before questioning.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Individuals aged between 18&lt;U+2013&gt;34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of 5, and 32% by the age of 12.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
