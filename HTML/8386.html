It forms part of the <a href="A24_road_(Northern_Ireland)" title="wikilink">A24</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Having previously been the home of <a href="George_Chichester,_2nd_Marquess_of_Donegall" title="wikilink">George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall</a>, a road was first built in 1815, when it was known more commonly as the New Ballynafeigh Road before eventually taking on the name of the <a href="Ormeau_Park" title="wikilink">Ormeau Park</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The road, although already well known as one of the key southern arterial routes into Belfast gained some small extra measure of notoriety because of the tensions regarding the <a href="Orange_Order" title="wikilink">Orange Order</a>'s attempts to march there on the <a href="The_Twelfth" title="wikilink">Twelfth</a>.</p>
<h2 id="areas-of-the-ormeau-road">Areas of the Ormeau Road</h2>
<h3 id="the-markets-area">The Markets area</h3>
<p>The Markets area marks the beginning of the Ormeau Road as it comes out of <a href="Belfast_city_centre" title="wikilink">Belfast city centre</a>. The area is based around Cromac Street and the historic <a href="St_George&#39;s_Market" title="wikilink">St George's Market</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The area was substantially redeveloped in the 1980s and more money has been earmarked for further regeneration.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A working-class <a href="Irish_nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> area, it was something of a stronghold for the <a href="Official_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Official Irish Republican Army</a>, with leading figures such as <a href="Joe_McCann" title="wikilink">Joe McCann</a> active in the area. McCann's killing in 1972 weakened the movement as a whole and saw the area become more open to the <a href="Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="wikilink">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> and <a href="Irish_National_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Irish National Liberation Army</a>. Four members of the INLA have their deaths commemorated in a plaque in the area.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The area's proximity to the city's defunct <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music halls</a> led to a number of performers staying temporary lodgings in the area's Joy Street, with <a href="Charlie_Chaplin" title="wikilink">Charlie Chaplin</a> and <a href="Laurel_&amp;_Hardy" title="wikilink">Laurel &amp; Hardy</a> amongst the leading names to have lodged there.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The area was also the birthplace of <a href="snooker" class="uri" title="wikilink">snooker</a> star <a href="Joe_Swail" title="wikilink">Joe Swail</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and home to Belfast 'hard man' Silver McKee.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Jackie_Wright" title="wikilink">Jackie Wright</a>, famous as <a href="Benny_Hill" title="wikilink">Benny Hill</a>'s sidekick came from Joy Street.</p>
<h3 id="the-gasworks">The Gasworks</h3>
<p><img src="Gasworks_Belfast.jpg" title="fig:Gasworks from Cromac Street, October 2010" alt="Gasworks from Cromac Street, October 2010" width="200" /> Close to the Markets is the Belfast Gasworks, built between 1887 and 1893 by such leading Belfast industrialists as Robert Watt, James Stelfox and John Lanyon. It remained open for its original purpose until 1988.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The area has been substantially redeveloped under the <a href="Laganside_Corporation" title="wikilink">Laganside Corporation</a> and now includes a number of office buildings for companies such as <a href="Halifax_(United_Kingdom_bank)" title="wikilink">Halifax</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Gasworks is also home to the Radisson Blu Hotel Belfast.</p>
<h3 id="donegall-pass">Donegall Pass</h3>
<p>Donegall Pass faces the Gasworks and represents a <a href="Ulster_loyalism" title="wikilink">loyalist</a> interface between the <a href="Irish_republicanism" title="wikilink">republican</a> areas of the Markets and the Lower Ormeau. It leads on to the <a href="Donegall_Road" title="wikilink">Donegall Road</a>. In the years since 2004 &quot;the Pass&quot; has seen instances of <a href="racism" class="uri" title="wikilink">racism</a> rise as <a href="Chinese_people" title="wikilink">Chinese</a> and <a href="Poles" title="wikilink">Polish</a> communities have become established in the area. Combating this growth has been one of the areas of concern of the Donegall Pass Community Forum, founded in 1996.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="havelock-house">Havelock House</h3>
<p>The headquarters of <a href="UTV_plc" title="wikilink">UTV plc</a>, <a href="Havelock_House,_Belfast" title="wikilink">Havelock House</a>, have been situated between Donegall Pass and the Lower Ormeau since the station first went on air in October 1959.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The headquarters of <a href="Belfast_CityBeat" title="wikilink">Belfast CityBeat</a> are situated very close to Havelock House, just over the Havelock Bridge (which crosses the main Belfast to Dublin railway line which runs under the Ormeau Road).</p>
<h3 id="lower-ormeau">Lower Ormeau</h3>
<p><img src="Sinn_Fein_Ormeau.jpg" title="fig:Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in South Belfast office, Lower Ormeau Road" alt="Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in South Belfast office, Lower Ormeau Road" width="150" /> The Lower Ormeau is regarded by those who live there as the main nationalist&lt;U+2013&gt;republican area of the Ormeau Road and includes the <a href="Belfast_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Belfast South</a> constituency offices of both <a href="Sinn_F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in" title="wikilink">Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in</a> and the <a href="Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> (SDLP) who hold the South Belfast seat at Westminster.</p>
<p>The area suffered a number of attacks during <a href="the_Troubles" title="wikilink">the Troubles</a>, when both Protestant and Catholic working-classes were killed: most notably on 5 February 1992 when two gunmen attacked Sean Graham's bookmakers, killing four men and a fifteen-year-old boy in the shop. The attack was claimed by the &quot;Ulster Freedom Fighters&quot;, a cover name used by the <a href="Ulster_Defence_Association" title="wikilink">Ulster Defence Association</a> (UDA).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Popular opinion in the area blamed <a href="Joe_Bratty" title="wikilink">Joe Bratty</a> and Raymond Elder, two leading UDA members from the nearby Annadale Flats, although it has since been claimed that, whilst Bratty and Elder were involved in planning the massacre, the gunmen were actually brought in from east Belfast.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Bratty and Elder were both killed by the Provisional IRA on the Ormeau Road on 31 July 1994.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Upper Ormeau UDA was also responsible for the murder of Theresa Clinton, a housewife who lived on Balfour Avenue during the same period. Bratty and Elder were widely suspected of involvement and their killing by the IRA led to celebrations amongst ordinary Catholics in the area.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The gang, which they led, were responsible for a numerous murders in the area.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The area was the scene of controversy due to the parade by bands from Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge over the Ormeau Bridge and through the area. As well as the general opposition of the community to the parades, claims were also made that members of the lodge had demonstrated triumphalism over the murder of five men in Sean Graham's bookmakers by the UDA.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1996, the dispute spilled over into conflict between the Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group and the <a href="Royal_Ulster_Constabulary" title="wikilink">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> after widespread rioting led the police to effectively seal off the area for two days.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <a href="Parades_Commission" title="wikilink">Parades Commission</a> initially supported the marchers in the dispute<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> although since 1999 parades have been banned from the area, even leading to the Orange Order briefly using the Ormeau Park as its meeting place instead of <a href="Edenderry,_County_Down" title="wikilink">Edenderry</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Until 1999, the <a href="North_of_Ireland_FC" title="wikilink">North of Ireland Cricket and Football Club</a>'s home stadium &lt;U+2013&gt; one of the earliest international rugby venues in Ireland<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> - was in the area, although, following a series of perceived sectarian arson attacks<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, the club's merger into the <a href="Belfast_Harlequins" title="wikilink">Belfast Harlequins</a> has seen the demolition of the stadium, which has been redeveloped as housing, known as Lavinia Square and Mews.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ormeau-bridge">Ormeau Bridge</h3>
<p><img src="Ormeau_Bridge,_Belfast,_May_2010_(02).JPG" title="fig:Ormeau Bridge, May 2010" alt="Ormeau Bridge, May 2010" width="200" /> The Ormeau Bridge links the so-called or self-styled, Lower Ormeau to the rest of the road, crossing the <a href="River_Lagan" title="wikilink">River Lagan</a>. Work began on the bridge in 1815 and was completed by 1818 or 1822. The bridge was demolished as unusable however and was not fully rebuilt until 1863.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Lagan forms the boundary between <a href="County_Antrim" title="wikilink">County Antrim</a>, encompassing the inner-city districts, and <a href="County_Down" title="wikilink">County Down</a>, lying to the south-east.</p>
<h3 id="ormeau-park">Ormeau Park</h3>
<p><img src="Ormeau.JPG" title="fig:Entrance gates to the Ormeau Park, 2009" alt="Entrance gates to the Ormeau Park, 2009" /> The Ormeau Park is across the bridge from the Lower Ormeau. It is the city's oldest municipal park, dating back to 1871 and stretches from the Ormeau Road to the <a href="Ravenhill,_Belfast" title="wikilink">Ravenhill Road</a>. It is also the home of <a href="Ormeau_Golf_Club" title="wikilink">Ormeau Golf Club</a>. Outside the Park a <a href="Segregated_cycle_facilities" title="wikilink">cycle path</a> has been added to the road.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The park has been used for Orange gatherings on the Twelfth as well as other open air events such as <a href="revival_meeting" title="wikilink">revival meetings</a>. It was also the scene of the first meeting of the <a href="Ulster_Vanguard" title="wikilink">Ulster Vanguard</a> on 18 March 1972 when <a href="William_Craig_(politician)" title="wikilink">William Craig</a> called on his followers to attend following his decision to leave the <a href="Ulster_Unionist_Party" title="wikilink">Ulster Unionist Party</a>. Joined by 100,000 followers Craig made a controversial speech in which he stated that &quot;we must build up a dossier of the men and women who are a menace to this country because if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The park was considered as an alternative venue for a new multi-purpose sports stadium, although <a href="Office_of_the_First_Minister_and_Deputy_First_Minister" title="wikilink">First Minister</a> <a href="Ian_Paisley" title="wikilink">Ian Paisley</a> vetoed the plans.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ormeau-bakery">Ormeau Bakery</h3>
<p><img src="OrmeauBakery.jpg" title="fig:Redeveloped Ormeau Bakery, October 2010" alt="Redeveloped Ormeau Bakery, October 2010" width="200" /> The Ormeau Bakery was the home of Ormo bread, formerly the largest independent bakery in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. The company celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2002 but was then bought out by <a href="Mother&#39;s_Pride" title="wikilink">Mother's Pride</a>, leading to a closing of the site.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The bakery has been redeveloped as upmarket, luxury apartments with roof gardens and other decorative touches according to designs by <a href="Diarmuid_Gavin" title="wikilink">Diarmuid Gavin</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ormeau Bakery is situated between the loyalist Annadale housing estate and the middle class area around Park Road, North Parade and South Parade. Cooke Centenary Church, a <a href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> place of worship that faces the Bakery, is unique on the road as having no number in its postal address being simply Ormeau Park, Belfast.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ballynafeigh-orange-lodge">Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge</h3>
<p><img src="Ballynafeighorange.JPG" title="fig:Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge, 2009" alt="Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge, 2009" width="180" /> Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge is situated on the Ormeau Road and is the main centre for Orangeism in the area.
