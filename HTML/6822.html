<p><strong>Fort Ticonderoga</strong> is a large eighteenth-century <a href="fort" class="uri" title="wikilink">fort</a> built at a narrows near the south end of <a href="Lake_Champlain" title="wikilink">Lake Champlain</a> in upstate <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>. The site controls a <a href="portage" class="uri" title="wikilink">portage</a> between Lake Champlain and <a href="Lake_George_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Lake George</a> that was strategically important during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> and <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>. At stake were commonly-used trade routes between the English-controlled <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> Valley and the French-controlled <a href="Saint_Lawrence_River" title="wikilink">Saint Lawrence River</a> Valley. The name &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; comes from an <a href="Iroquoian_languages" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a> word <em>tekontar&lt;U+00F3&gt;:ken</em>, meaning &quot;it is at the junction of two waterways&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The French, who called it <strong>Fort Carillon</strong>, constructed the fort between 1755 and 1758, during the <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a>. The fort attained a reputation of impregnability during the 1758 <a href="Battle_of_Carillon" title="wikilink">Battle of Carillon</a> when an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort was repelled by 4,000 French defenders. In 1759, the British returned, and drove a token French <a href="garrison" class="uri" title="wikilink">garrison</a> from the fort merely by <a href="Battle_of_Ticonderoga_(1759)" title="wikilink">occupying high ground that threatened the fort</a>. During the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a> the fort again saw action in May 1775 when it was <a href="Capture_of_Fort_Ticonderoga" title="wikilink">captured in a surprise attack</a> by the <a href="Green_Mountain_Boys" title="wikilink">Green Mountain Boys</a> and other state militia commanded by <a href="Ethan_Allen" title="wikilink">Ethan Allen</a> and <a href="Benedict_Arnold" title="wikilink">Benedict Arnold</a>. Americans held it until June 1777, when British forces under General <a href="John_Burgoyne" title="wikilink">John Burgoyne</a> again <a href="Battle_of_Ticonderoga_(1777)" title="wikilink">occupied high ground above the fort</a> and threatened the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a>, leading it to withdraw from the fort and its surrounding defenses. The only direct attack on the fort took place during the British occupation of the fort in September 1777, when <a href="John_Brown_of_Pittsfield" title="wikilink">John Brown</a> led 500 Americans in an attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders.</p>
<p>The fort was abandoned by the British following the failure of the <a href="Saratoga_campaign" title="wikilink">Saratoga campaign</a>, and ceased to be of any notable military value after 1781. It fell into ruins, was stripped of some of its usable stone, metal and woodwork, and became a stop on tourist routes of the area in the 19th century. The fort was restored by its private owners early in the 20th century, and is now operated by a <a href="foundation_(charity)" title="wikilink">foundation</a> as a tourist attraction, museum, and research center.</p>

The route was relatively free of obstacles to navigation, with only a few <a href="portage" title="wikilink">portages</a>. One strategically important place on the route lies at a narrows near the southern end of Lake Champlain, where Ticonderoga Creek, known in <a href="Colonial_history_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Colonial times</a> as the La Chute River, enters the lake, carrying water from <a href="Lake_George_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Lake George</a>.

Champlain recounted that the <a href="Algonquin" title="wikilink">Algonquins</a>, with whom he was traveling, battled a group of <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a> nearby.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1642, French missionary <a href="Isaac_Jogues" title="wikilink">Isaac Jogues</a> was the first white man to traverse the portage at Ticonderoga while escaping a battle between the Iroquois and members of the <a href="Huron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huron</a> tribe.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The French, who had <a href="French_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">colonized</a> the <a href="Saint_Lawrence_River" title="wikilink">Saint Lawrence River</a> valley to the north, and the English, who had taken over the <a href="Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Dutch settlements</a> that became the <a href="Province_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Province of New York</a> to the south, began contesting the area as early as 1691, when <a href="Pieter_Schuyler" title="wikilink">Pieter Schuyler</a> built a small wooden fort at the Ticonderoga point on the western shore of the lake.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These colonial conflicts reached their height in the <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a>, which began in 1754.</p>

<p>The work in 1755 consisted primarily of beginning construction on the main walls and the Lotbini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re <a href="redoubt" class="uri" title="wikilink">redoubt</a>, an <a href="outwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">outwork</a> to the west of the site that provided additional cover of the La Chute River. In 1756, the four main <a href="bastion" title="wikilink">bastions</a> were built, as was a sawmill on the La Chute. Work slowed in 1757, when many of the troops were employed preparing for, or participating in, the <a href="Battle_of_Fort_William_Henry" title="wikilink">attack on Fort William Henry</a>, and the barracks and <a href="demi-lune" title="wikilink">demi-lunes</a> were not completed until spring 1758.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="walls-and-bastions">Walls and bastions</h3>
<p>The fort's primary purpose was to control the south end of Lake Champlain, preventing the British from gaining military access to the lake. Consequently, its most important defenses, the Reine and Germaine bastions, were directed to the northeast and northwest, away from the lake, with demi-lunes further extending the works on the land side. The Joannes and Languedoc bastions overlooked the lake to the south, providing cover for the landing area outside the fort. The walls were seven feet (2.1 meters) high and fourteen feet (4.3 meters) thick, and the whole works was surrounded by a <a href="glacis" class="uri" title="wikilink">glacis</a> and a dry <a href="moat" class="uri" title="wikilink">moat</a> five feet (1.5 meters) deep and  wide. When the walls were first erected in 1756, they were made of squared wooden timbers, with earth filling the gap. The French then began to <a href="Stonemasonry" title="wikilink">dress the walls with stone</a> from a <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a> about one mile (1.6 km) away, although this work was never fully completed.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> When the main defenses became ready for use, the fort was armed with <a href="cannon" title="wikilink">cannons</a> hauled from <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a> and Fort St. Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="inside-and-outside">Inside and outside</h3>
<p>Inside the fort there were three <a href="barracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">barracks</a> and four <a href="storehouse" title="wikilink">storehouses</a>. One bastion held a bakery capable of producing 60 loaves of bread per day. A <a href="Magazine_(artillery)" title="wikilink">powder magazine</a> was hacked out of the <a href="bedrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">bedrock</a> beneath the Joannes bastion. All of the construction within the fort was of stone.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Outside the fort, between the southern wall and the lake shore, was an area protected by a wooden <a href="palisade" class="uri" title="wikilink">palisade</a>. In addition to the main landing area for the fort, it contained additional storage facilities and other works necessary for maintenance of the fort.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> When it became apparent in 1756 that the fort had been sited too far to the west of the lake, an additional redoubt was constructed to the east to provide cannon coverage over the <a href="narrows" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrows</a> of the lake.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

General <a href="Louis-Joseph_de_Montcalm" title="wikilink">Montcalm</a> and two of his <a href="military_engineer" title="wikilink">military engineers</a> surveyed the works in 1758, and found something to criticize in almost every aspect of the fort's construction. Buildings were built too high (and thus easier to bomb); the powder magazine leaked; the <a href="masonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">masonry</a> was of poor quality.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The critics apparently failed to notice the significant strategic weakness of its position&lt;U+2014&gt;that there were several significant hills whose heights commanded the fort.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Lotbini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re, who may have been awarded the job of building the fort only because he was related to Vaudreuil, had lost a bid to become Canada's chief engineer to one of those engineers in 1756, all of which may explain the highly negative report; his career suffered for years afterwards.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="#Nester" title="wikilink">William Nester</a>, in his exhaustive analysis of the Battle of Carillon, notes additional problems with the fort's construction. The fort was small (about  wide) for a Vauban-style fort, with a barracks capable of holding only 400 soldiers. Storage space inside the fort was similarly limited, requiring the storage of provisions outside the fort's walls in exposed places. Its <a href="cistern" class="uri" title="wikilink">cistern</a> was also small, and the <a href="water_quality" title="wikilink">water quality</a> was supposedly poor.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

Abercromby tried to move rapidly against the few French defenders, opting to forgo <a href="field_artillery" title="wikilink">field cannon</a> and relying instead on the numerical superiority of his 16,000 troops. In the <a href="Battle_of_Carillon" title="wikilink">Battle of Carillon</a>, the British were soundly defeated by the 4,000 French defenders.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The battle took place far enough away from the fort that its guns were rarely used.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The battle gave the fort a reputation of impregnability, which had an impact on future military operations in the area, notably during the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Following the French victory, Montcalm, anticipating further British attacks, ordered additional work on the defenses, including the construction of the Germain and Pontleroy redoubts (named for the engineers under whose direction they were constructed) to the northeast of the fort.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> However, the British did not attack again in 1758, so the French withdrew all but a small garrison of men for the winter in November.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

Although the British worked in 1759 and 1760 to repair and improve the fort,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> the fort saw no more significant action in the war. After the war, the British <a href="garrison" title="wikilink">garrisoned</a> it with a small numbers of troops, and allowed it to fall into disrepair.

General Schuyler, heading the forces stationed at Ticonderoga, requested 10,000 troops to guard Ticonderoga and 2,000 to guard the <a href="Mohawk_River" title="wikilink">Mohawk River</a> valley against British invasion from the north. <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a>, who had never been to Ticonderoga (his only visit was in 1783),<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> believed that an overland attack from the north was unlikely, due to the alleged impregnability of Ticonderoga.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This, combined with continuing incursions up the Hudson River valley by British forces occupying <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, led Washington to believe that any attack on the <a href="Albany,_New_York" title="wikilink">Albany</a> area would be from the south, which, as it was part of the supply line to Ticonderoga, would necessitate a withdrawal from the fort. As a result, no significant actions were taken to further fortify Ticonderoga or significantly increase its garrison.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The garrison, about 2,000 men under General <a href="Arthur_St._Clair" title="wikilink">Arthur St. Clair</a>, was too small to man all of the defenses.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>General Gates, who oversaw the northern defenses, was aware that <a href="Mount_Defiance" title="wikilink">Mount Defiance</a> presented a problem in attempts to defend the fort.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> <a href="John_Trumbull" title="wikilink">John Trumbull</a> had pointed this out as early as 1776, when a shot fired from the fort was able to reach Defiance's summit, and several officers inspecting the hill noted that there were approaches to its summit where <a href="gun_carriage" title="wikilink">gun carriages</a> could be pulled up the sides.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> As the garrison was too small to properly defend all of the existing works in area, Mount Defiance was left undefended.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Anthony Wayne left Ticonderoga in April 1777 to join Washington's army; he reported to Washington that &quot;all was well&quot;, and that the fort &quot;can never be carried, without much loss of blood&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>General Burgoyne led 7,800 British and <a href="Hessian_(soldiers)" title="wikilink">Hessian</a> forces south from Quebec in June 1777.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> After occupying nearby <a href="Fort_Crown_Point" title="wikilink">Fort Crown Point</a> without opposition on June 30, they prepared to <a href="Battle_of_Ticonderoga_(1777)" title="wikilink">besiege Ticonderoga</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Burgoyne realized the <a href="military_tactics" title="wikilink">tactical</a> advantage of the <a href="high_ground" title="wikilink">high ground</a>, and had his troops haul cannons to the top of Mount Defiance. Faced with bombardment from the heights (even before any shots had been fired from those cannons), General St. Clair ordered Ticonderoga abandoned on July 5, 1777. Burgoyne's troops moved in the next day,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> with advance guards pursuing the retreating Americans.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Washington, on hearing of Burgoyne's advance and the retreat from Ticonderoga, stated that the event was &quot;not apprehended, nor within the compass of my reasoning&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> News of the abandonment of the &quot;Impregnable Bastion&quot; without a fight, caused &quot;the greatest surprise and alarm&quot; throughout the colonies.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> After public outcry over his actions, General St. Clair was <a href="court-martial" title="wikilink">court-martialed</a> in 1778. He was cleared on all charges.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="one-last-attack">One last attack</h3>
<p>Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Henry_Watson_Powell" title="wikilink">Henry Watson Powell</a>. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a <a href="blockhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">blockhouse</a> they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> George Washington sent General <a href="Benjamin_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Benjamin Lincoln</a> into the <a href="New_Hampshire_Grants" title="wikilink">New Hampshire Grants</a> to &quot;divide and distract the enemy&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Aware that Fort Ticonderoga housed American <a href="POW" title="wikilink">prisoners</a>, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to <a href="Whitehall_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Skenesboro</a>, which the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel <a href="John_Brown_of_Pittsfield" title="wikilink">John Brown</a> led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release the prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised the British contingent holding prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops snuck up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men the moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines <a href="skirmisher" title="wikilink">skirmished</a>. At this point Brown's men dragged two six-pound guns, captured earlier, up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Surrender_of_General_Burgoyne.jpg" title="fig:John Trumbull&#39;s depiction of the Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga" alt="John Trumbull&#39;s depiction of the Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga" /> The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as <a href="grapeshot" class="uri" title="wikilink">grapeshot</a> fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A <a href="stalemate" class="uri" title="wikilink">stalemate</a> persisted, with regular exchanges of cannon fire, until September 21, when 100 Hessians, returning from the Mohawk Valley to support Burgoyne, arrived on the scene to provide reinforcement to the besieged fort.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Brown eventually sent a <a href="truce" class="uri" title="wikilink">truce</a> party to the fort to open negotiations; the party was fired on, and three of its five members were killed.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Brown, realizing that the weaponry they had was insufficient to take the fort, decided to withdraw. Destroying many <a href="bateaux" class="uri" title="wikilink">bateaux</a> and seizing a ship on Lake George, he set off to annoy British positions on that lake.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> His action resulted in the freeing of 118 Americans and the capture of 293 British troops, while suffering fewer than ten casualties.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="abandonment">Abandonment</h3>
<p>Following Burgoyne's <a href="Battles_of_Saratoga" title="wikilink">defeat at Saratoga</a>, the fort at Ticonderoga became increasingly irrelevant. The British abandoned it and nearby <a href="Fort_Crown_Point" title="wikilink">Fort Crown Point</a> in November 1777, destroying both as best they could prior to their withdrawal.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The fort was occasionally reoccupied by British raiding parties in the following years, but it no longer held a prominent strategic role in the war. It was finally abandoned by the British for good in 1781, following the <a href="Siege_of_Yorktown" title="wikilink">surrender at Yorktown</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Area residents began stripping the fort of usable building materials, even melting some of the cannons down for their metal in the years following the war.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1785, the fort's lands became the property of the state of New York.

In 1848, the <a href="Hudson_River_School" title="wikilink">Hudson River School</a> artist Russell Smith painted <em>Ruins of Fort Ticonderoga</em>, depicting the condition of the fort.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
