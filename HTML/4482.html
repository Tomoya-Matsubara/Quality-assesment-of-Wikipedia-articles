<p><strong>Ohio State Route 55</strong> <strong>(OH 55)</strong> is an east-west <a href="state_route" title="wikilink">state route</a> in western <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>. Its western terminus is near the town of <a href="Laura,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Laura</a> at <a href="Ohio_State_Route_571" title="wikilink">OH 571</a>, and its eastern terminus is in downtown <a href="Urbana,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Urbana</a> at the confluence of <a href="U.S._Route_36_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 36</a>, <a href="U.S._Route_68_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 68</a>, <a href="Ohio_State_Route_29" title="wikilink">OH 29</a> and <a href="Ohio_State_Route_54" title="wikilink">OH 54</a>. OH 55 runs concurrent with US 68 for 1 mile approaching its eastern terminus.</p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>
<p>OH 55 starts from an intersection with <a href="Ohio_State_Route_571" title="wikilink">OH 571</a> just east of <a href="Laura,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Laura</a> in <a href="Union_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Union Township</a>. OH 55 starts out in a northeasterly direction by straddling the Ludlow Creek and some woods on the south side, and farmland on the north side, with occasional houses along the way. OH 55 intersects Miami County Road 50, then turns easterly, meeting County Road 9 further east. Bending slightly to the southeast, OH 55 meets Elleman Road, then turns east until it intersects Davis Road, where it shifts to the northeast, and heads into <a href="Ludlow_Falls,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Ludlow Falls</a>. OH 55 maneuvers through this predominantly residential village via Greenville Avenue, Covington Avenue and Friend Street, along which OH 55 meets <a href="Ohio_State_Route_48" title="wikilink">OH 48</a> at a T-intersection. Here, OH 55 turns south and departs Ludlow Falls concurrent with OH 48.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>OH 55 and OH 48 run together for less than 0.5 mile, crossing Ludlow Creek in the process. OH 55 splits off from OH 48, and resumes an easterly trek through farm country. OH 55 starts to bend northeasterly as it meets Calumet Road, crosses over the <a href="Stillwater_River_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">Stillwater River</a>, and intersects Kessler-Frederick Road consecutively. Continuing northeasterly, OH 55 has intersections with Greenlee Road and Miami County Road 139. OH 55 departs Union Township, and enters <a href="Concord_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Concord Township</a>, whereupon it meets Horseshoe Bend Road (Miami County Road 39). OH 55 passes an intersection with Miami County Road 132, and then meets Miami County Road 41. At that intersection, OH 55 enters into <a href="Troy,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Troy</a>, and the landscape changes from rural to suburban, with subdivisions dotting the landscape.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

An aged BL I-75 shield accompanies the OH 55 shield shown here." alt="View looking west along WB OH 55 in downtown Troy. An aged BL I-75 shield accompanies the OH 55 shield shown here." />OH 55 widens out to a four-lane divided highway at the Bamhart Road intersection, where the highway enters into a more commercial area. Following Fenner Road, OH 55 arrives a diamond interchange with <a href="Interstate_75_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">I-75</a> . East of I-75, OH 55 almost immediately arrives at the eastern terminus of <a href="Ohio_State_Route_718" title="wikilink">OH 718</a>, a signalized T-intersection. Past OH 718, OH 55 narrows down to two lanes, and enters into a primarily residential portion of Troy along West Market Street. OH 55 meets South Market Street, the former routing of <a href="U.S._Route_25" title="wikilink">US 25</a>, and turns northeasterly toward the central business district. Once into downtown Troy, OH 55 intersects <a href="Ohio_State_Route_41" title="wikilink">OH 41</a> at a traffic circle in Public Square.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Departing from the traffic circle in a northeasterly fashion, OH 55 intersects Water Street, then immediately crosses the <a href="Great_Miami_River" title="wikilink">Great Miami River</a>. After crossing the river, OH 55 turns easterly onto Staunton Road from Market Street. While passing to the north of the Miami Shores Golf Course, a series of residential subdivisions abut the north side of OH 55. On the outskirts of Troy, OH 55 meets <a href="Ohio_State_Route_202" title="wikilink">OH 202</a> at its northern terminus. Entering into <a href="Staunton_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Staunton Township</a>, OH 55 starts to trend northeasterly, with the residential setting yielding to a more rural landscape featuring vast amounts of farmland, with the occasional house situated off of the highway. OH 55 intersects Sayers Road, then crosses into <a href="Lost_Creek_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Lost Creek Township</a>. After passing Casstown-Sidney Road, OH 55 arrives in <a href="Casstown,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Casstown</a>. Entering into town on Troy Pike, OH 55 turns north onto Main Street, and follows Casstown&lt;U+2019&gt;s main drag up to the <a href="Ohio_State_Route_589" title="wikilink">OH 589</a> junction. OH 55 turns easterly onto Addison Street, while OH 589 northbound begins straight ahead at that intersection.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>OH 55 departs Casstown, and continues easterly through Lost Creek Township. Turning northeasterly again, OH 55 passes occasional patches of trees amidst the vast farmland. OH 55 intersects Rugged Hill Road, bends back to the east, then meets Sodom Road. Trending more southeasterly at this point, OH 55 arrives at a T-intersection that marks the northern terminus of <a href="Ohio_State_Route_201" title="wikilink">OH 201</a>. East of there, OH 55 resumes an easterly path, intersecting Alcony-Conover Road, and crossing into <a href="Champaign_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Champaign County</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Into Champaign County, OH 55 makes a brief trip through <a href="Jackson_Township,_Champaign_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Jackson Township</a> en route to <a href="Christiansburg,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Christiansburg</a>. OH 55 passes through the community along Pike Street, a primarily residential street. Departing Christiansburg to the east, OH 55 re-emerges into rural Jackson Township. Turning northeasterly, OH 55 passes by Panhandle Road, then curves to the east just prior to meeting <a href="Ohio_State_Route_235" title="wikilink">OH 235</a>. Vast swaths of farmland and the occasional house compose OH 55&lt;U+2019&gt;s surroundings east of OH 235, as the highway passes by intersections with St. Paris-New Carlisle Road, Heck Road and Dialton Road. OH 55 next enters into <a href="Mad_River_Township,_Champaign_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Mad River Township</a>. OH 55 passes through the hamlet of <a href="Thackery,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Thackery</a>, briefly turning north at the Hampton-Donnellsville Road intersection there before resuming its easterly course. The highway turns southeasterly where it meets Vance Road, then makes a turn to the northeast in the unincorporated community of <a href="Terre_Haute,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Terre Haute</a> at the intersection of Coffin Station Road and Storms Creek Road. The northeasterly trend of this two-lane route continues until Rhodes Road, where OH 55 takes on a more east-northeasterly trend through the intersection with Valley Pike, which also serves as the southern terminus of <a href="Ohio_State_Route_560" title="wikilink">OH 560</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Proceeding eastward, OH 55 meets Bair Road, then turns northeasterly upon crossing over the <a href="Mad_River_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">Mad River</a>. OH 55 then parallels the Mad River for a stretch, intersecting Hickory Grove Road in the process. Curving ever so slightly to the east, OH 55 meets Old Troy Pike. Turning due east, OH 55 enters into <a href="Urbana,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Urbana</a>. The rural setting fades, and OH 55 enters into a more commercialized area along, fittingly, Commercial Street. OH 55 meets <a href="U.S._Route_68_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 68</a> at a T-intersection in the southern portion of Urbana. There, OH 55 turns northerly, and the two routes combine to form the main north-south drag through the city. In downtown Urbana, OH 55 comes to an end as the US 68/OH 55 duplex intersects <a href="U.S._Route_36_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 36</a>, <a href="Ohio_State_Route_29" title="wikilink">OH 29</a> and <a href="Ohio_State_Route_54" title="wikilink">OH 54</a> at a traffic circle.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The OH 55 that exists today is only a shadow of what it was when first designated in the 1920s. OH 55 came into being in 1923.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Its original routing took it from <a href="Troy,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Troy</a> all the way up to <a href="Parma,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Parma</a>. This route encompassed the current alignment of OH 55 between Troy and <a href="Urbana,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Urbana</a>, the current <a href="U.S._Route_36_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 36</a> from Urbana to <a href="Delaware,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Delaware</a>, the current <a href="U.S._Route_42_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">US 42</a> from Delaware to <a href="Medina,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Medina</a>, the current <a href="Ohio_State_Route_3" title="wikilink">OH 3</a> from Medina to <a href="Hinckley,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Hinckley</a>, and the current <a href="Ohio_State_Route_94" title="wikilink">OH 94</a> from Hinckley to Parma. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1926, OH 55 was extended on the western end along a previously un-numbered road to <a href="Ludlow_Falls,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Ludlow Falls</a>. In that same year, however, the advent of the U.S. Highway System resulted in a major truncation of OH 55 on the east side. Its new eastern terminus became <a href="Ohio_State_Route_4" title="wikilink">OH 4</a> southwest of <a href="Milford_Center,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Milford Center</a>. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> OH 55 was further truncated on the east end in 1932, when the coming of US 36 resulted in the relocation of OH 55's eastern terminus to its current location in downtown Urbana.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>1937 brought another elongation of OH 55 on the western end. In that year, it was extended from Ludlow Falls to its present western terminus.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
