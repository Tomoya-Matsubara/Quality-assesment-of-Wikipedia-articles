<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>
<p>Eight people of different <a href="social_class" title="wikilink">social classes</a> have been invited to go to a mansion on Soldier Island, which, in reality, is based upon <a href="Burgh_Island" title="wikilink">Burgh Island</a> off the coast of Devon<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, by a Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen. Upon arriving, they are told by the butler and his wife, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, that their hosts are currently away. Each guest finds in his or her room a slightly odd bit of <a href="bric-a-brac" class="uri" title="wikilink">bric-a-brac</a> and a framed copy of the nursery rhyme &quot;Ten Little Soldiers&quot; (&quot;Ten Little <a href="Niggers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Niggers</a>&quot; in the original 1939 UK publication and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; in the 1940 US publication) hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>During a large dinner, the guests notice ten soldier figurines on the dining room table. Later, while they are having a dinner, a <a href="Phonograph" title="wikilink">gramophone</a> record plays, informing the ten that all of them are guilty of murder. All of the guests acknowledge their awareness and, in some cases, involvement in the deaths of the persons mentioned, while denying any malice or legal culpability.</p>
<p>The guests realize they have all been tricked into coming to the island, but now have no way to get back to the mainland, as the boat which regularly delivers supplies stops arriving. They are then murdered, one by one, with each murder paralleling a verse of the nursery rhyme, and one of the ten soldier figurines being removed after each murder.</p>
<p>First to die is Anthony Marston, whose drink is poisoned with <a href="cyanide" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyanide</a> (one choked his little self). That night, Thomas Rogers notices that one soldier figurine is missing from the dining table. The next morning, Mrs. Rogers never wakes up, and is assumed to have received a fatal overdose of sleeping draught (one overslept himself). At lunchtime, General MacArthur, who had predicted that he would never leave the island alive, is found dead from a blow to the back of his head (one said he'd stay there) when Dr. Armstrong calls him to lunch. In growing panic, the survivors search the island for the murderer or possible hiding places, but find no one. Justice Wargrave establishes himself as a decisive leader of the group; he asserts that one of them must be the murderer and is playing a sadistic game with them; an example of the killer's twisted humor is that—with the exception of Wargrave and Marston—each of the &quot;guests&quot; has been invited to come to the Island by Mr/Mrs &quot;U.N.Owen&quot; (i.e. &quot;UNknOWN&quot;). In addition, every time someone dies, a soldier figurine disappears.</p>
<p>The next morning, Rogers is missing, and they notice one of the little soldier figurines is missing as well. Rogers is soon found dead in the woodshed, having been struck in the head with a large axe (one chopped himself in halves). Later that day, while the others are in the drawing room, Emily Brent stays in the dining room and she dies from an injection of <a href="potassium_cyanide" title="wikilink">potassium cyanide</a>—the injection mark on her neck is an allusion to a bee sting (a bumblebee stung one). The hypodermic needle is found outside, thrown from the window along with a smashed china soldier figurine. The five survivors—Dr. Armstrong, Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard, Vera Claythorne, and Ex-Inspector Blore—become increasingly frightened. Wargrave announces that anything on the island that could be used as a weapon should be locked up, including Wargrave's sleeping pills and Armstrong's medical equipment; Lombard admits to bringing a revolver to the island, but it has gone missing. They decide to sit in the drawing room, with only one leaving at any one time—theoretically, they should all be safe that way. Vera, the one most wracked by guilt, goes up to her room and discovers a strand of seaweed planted there; her screams attract the attention of Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong, who rush to her aid. When they return to the drawing room, they find Wargrave, dressed up in a judge's wig and gown, slumped against a chair with a gunshot wound in his forehead (one got into Chancery); Armstrong confirms his death.</p>
<p>That night, Blore hears someone sneaking out of the house. He searches the remaining rooms and discovers Armstrong missing from his room—so they think he must be the killer. Vera, Blore, and Lombard, whose revolver has since been returned to him, decide it best to go outside when morning arrives; when Blore's hunger later makes him go back into the house, he does not return; as Vera and Phillip search for him, they discover his body on the front lawn, his head crushed by Vera's marble, bear-shaped clock (a big bear hugged one). They assume that Armstrong has committed the murder and leave to walk along the shore. They find Armstrong's drowned body along the cliffs (a red herring swallowed one) and realize that they are the only two left; though neither could possibly have killed the Inspector, their mutual suspicion has driven them to the <a href="breaking_point" title="wikilink">breaking point</a> and each of them assumes the other to be the murderer. As they lift Armstrong's body out of reach of the water, Vera swipes Lombard's revolver, kills him on the beach (out in the sun; or, one shot the other), and returns to her room, discovering a <a href="noose" class="uri" title="wikilink">noose</a> hanging from the ceiling and a chair underneath it. Having finally been driven mad (or &quot;hypnotically suggestible&quot;) by the experience and tormented by latent remorse for her crime, Vera hangs herself, kicking the chair out from under her, fulfilling the final verse of the rhyme (hanged himself and then there were none).</p>
<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
<p>The epilogue consists of a conversation between Inspector Maine, in charge of the unsolved case, and the Assistant Commissioner at <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a>. The man who made all the arrangements for U.N. Owen's purchase of the island was Isaac Morris, a shady dealer known to efficiently cover his tracks when doing business. However, he cannot tell the police anything; he died of a drug overdose the day the party set sail. During the period when the killings took place and immediately after, no one could have got on or off the island without being seen; also, the weather was too bad anyway, ruling out the possibility that &quot;Mr. Owen&quot; was some unidentified person who committed the murders while evading detection from the guests.</p>
<p>The police have concluded from the forensic evidence and various characters' diaries that Blore, Armstrong, Lombard, and Vera were definitely the last to die. Blore could not have died last, as the clock was dropped onto him from above, and he could not have set up a way for it to fall on him. Armstrong could not have been last since his body was dragged above the high-tide mark by someone else; nor could Lombard, since he was shot on the beach but the revolver was found upstairs in the hallway, outside the door of Wargrave's room. This leaves Vera, whose fingerprints are on the pistol, and from whose window the clock was dropped on Blore; however, the chair which she kicked away with the <a href="Hangman&#39;s_knot" title="wikilink">noose</a> around her neck was found pushed against the wall, out of reach from where she would have had to stand on it.</p>
<p>In the end, although one of the guests <em>must</em> have been the killer, none of them <em>could</em> have been, leaving the two <a href="inspector" title="wikilink">inspectors</a> baffled.</p>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>A <a href="fishing_trawler" title="wikilink">fishing trawler</a>, <em>Emma Jane</em>, finds a letter in a bottle floating just off the <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a> coast, and sends it to <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a>, who recognise it as a confession by the late Justice Wargrave. In this narrative, he reveals that he has suffered from a certain <a href="sadist" title="wikilink">sadistic</a> temperament ever since childhood, when he performed torturous experiments on garden pests, a symptom which would later be defined under <a href="sociopathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">sociopathy</a>. However, this quality was juxtaposed uneasily with an innate sense of justice; he considered it abhorrent that any innocent person should die by his hand. Thus, given his mental make-up, he became a judge, ordering the <a href="death_penalty" title="wikilink">death penalty</a> in all cases where he firmly believed the accused person guilty. He also admitted that the primary reason he gave the death penalty was so he could enjoy seeing them crippled with fear by the knowledge that they would soon be hanged. But deep inside, Wargrave always felt a deep desire to commit a murder by his own hand and, after discovering that he was <a href="terminally_ill" title="wikilink">terminally ill</a>, decided to do just that by renting an island off the Devon coast, seeking out and luring nine people, all of whom have caused death and escaped justice. He then picked them off one by one, reveling in the <a href="psychological_abuse" title="wikilink">mental torture</a> each survivor experiences as their own fate approached. Wargrave also claims his extensive experience as a judge renders him capable of confirming their guilt by observing their reactions to the murders, and he did indeed intuit the guilt of all of the victims.</p>
<p>Before leaving for the island, he fobbed off as a cure-all a lethal dose of poison to the <a href="hypochondriac" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypochondriac</a> drug-dealer Isaac Morris—whose help he had previously solicited when making his purchase of the island—in retribution for causing the <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> of a young woman by leading her into <a href="substance_abuse" title="wikilink">substance abuse</a>.</p>
<p>After disposing of the first five guests, Marston, Ethel Rogers, Macarthur, Thomas Rogers and Brent, Wargrave fooled Armstrong into helping him fake his own (Wargrave's) murder—under the pretext that it would rattle the 'real murderer'— upon meeting Armstrong on the cliff in the middle of night, he pushed the doctor into the sea and could then orchestrate the rest of the killings without suspicion.</p>
<p>After Vera, who Wargrave considered the guiltiest by falsely taking credit in addition to causing a murder, hanged herself, Wargrave, who had been watching from the bedroom closet, pushed the chair against the wall. He then wrote out his confession, putting the letter in a bottle and casting the bottle into the sea. He states that his only regret is that it was not enough to concoct an unsolvable mystery—he craves posthumous recognition of his brilliant scheme—therefore he explains three clues which should point to him as the killer in case his letter is not found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wargrave mentions in the letter that Edward Seton's death was justified because Seton, despite his charm and excellent performance on the witness stand, was genuinely guilty of the crime of which he was accused. After his death, more evidence emerged putting his guilt beyond doubt. Therefore, Wargrave was the only guest who did not wrongfully cause the death of anyone before coming to the island, though paradoxically, he would then be the <a href="executioner" class="uri" title="wikilink">executioner</a>.</li>
<li>The &quot;<a href="Red_herring_(narrative)" title="wikilink">red herring</a>&quot; line in the poem suggests the fact that Armstrong was tricked into his death—and the respectable Justice Wargrave is the only one of the remaining houseguests in whom Armstrong would have been likely to confide.</li>
<li>The bullet would leave a red mark in Wargrave's forehead similar to the <a href="Curse_and_mark_of_Cain" title="wikilink">mark of Cain</a>, the first murderer described in the Biblical <a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclusion of the judge's letter indicates that, after disposing of the bottle with the letter, he would shoot himself while sitting on his bed, so that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. He would first tie the gun loosely to a length of elastic cord looped around the doorknob, the other end of which would be tied to his eyeglasses beneath his body. After shooting himself with a handkerchief wrapped round the gun to avoid fingerprints, the recoil would snap the gun towards the doorknob. The gun striking the doorknob would detach the elastic, which in turn would snap back and lie dangling innocuously from his eyeglasses. The gun would fall to the floor of the corridor outside the now-closed bedroom door.</p>
<p>Thus the police would find ten dead bodies and an unsolvable mystery on Soldier Island.</p>

<p>The novel was originally published in Britain under the title <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> in 1939<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. All references to &quot;Indian&quot; in the story were originally &quot;Nigger&quot;: thus the island was called &quot;Nigger Island&quot; <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> rather than &quot;Indian Island&quot; and the rhyme found by each murder victim was also called <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> rather than <em>Ten Little Indians</em>. Modern printings use the rhyme <em>Ten Little Soldiers</em> and &quot;Soldier Island&quot;.</p>
<p>The UK serialisation was in twenty-three parts in the <em><a href="Daily_Express" title="wikilink">Daily Express</a></em> from Tuesday, June 6 to Saturday, July 1, 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by &quot;Prescott&quot; with the first instalment having an illustration of <a href="Burgh_Island" title="wikilink">Burgh Island</a> in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. This version did not contain any chapter divisions<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>For the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> market, the novel was first serialised in the <em><a href="Saturday_Evening_Post" title="wikilink">Saturday Evening Post</a></em> in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh and then published separately in book form in January 1940. Both publications used the less inflammatory title <em>And Then There Were None</em>. The 1945 motion picture also used this title. In 1946, the play was published under the new title <em>Ten Little Indians</em> (the same title under which it had been performed on <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a>), and in 1964 an American paperback edition also used this title.</p>
<p>British editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s and the first British edition to use the alternative title <em>And Then There Were None</em> appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Today <em>And Then There Were None</em> is the title most commonly used. However, the original title survives in many foreign-language versions of the novel: for example, the Greek title is <em>&lt;U+0394&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+039C&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt; &lt;U+039D&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;</em>, the <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> title is <em>Diez Negritos</em>, while the <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> title is <em>Dix petits n&lt;U+00E8&gt;gres</em> and the <a href="Hungarian_language" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a> title is <em>T&lt;U+00ED&gt;z kicsi n&lt;U+00E9&gt;ger</em> . <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> A <a href="Dutch_language" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> translation of 1981 used the work's original English title <em>Ten Little Niggers</em>.

<h2 id="literary-significance-and-reception">Literary significance and reception</h2>
<p>Generally, <em>And Then There Were None</em> is considered one of Agatha Christie's best works. Writing for <em><a href="The_Times_Literary_Supplement" title="wikilink">The Times Literary Supplement</a></em> of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, &quot;If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders.&quot; He continued, &quot;There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer. It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Many other reviews were as complementary; in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times_Book_Review" title="wikilink">The New York Times Book Review</a></em> of 25 February 1940, <a href="Isaac_Anderson" title="wikilink">Isaac Anderson</a> detailed the set-up of the plot up to the point where 'the voice' accuses the ten people of their past misdemeanors and then said, &quot;When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Such was the quality of Christie's work that many compared it to <a href="The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd" title="wikilink">Roger Ackroyd</a>. For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the <em><a href="Toronto_Star" title="wikilink">Toronto Daily Star</a></em> of 16 March 1940 said, &quot;Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With <em>And Then There Were None</em>... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the <em><a href="The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd" title="wikilink">Roger Ackroyd</a></em> level.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Other critics laud the use of twists, turns, and <a href="surprise_ending" title="wikilink">surprise endings</a>. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>'s issue of 5 November 1939 which began, &quot;No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with <em><a href="The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd" title="wikilink">Roger Ackroyd</a></em> and be content with saying that <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.&quot; After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, &quot;Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs. Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>More recent critics have concurred with these judgements. Says <a href="Robert_Barnard" title="wikilink">Robert Barnard</a>: &quot;Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Other recent commentators, however, have been more critical of the work, finding that Christie's original title and the setting on &quot;Nigger Island&quot; are integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Winter, &quot;could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Unlike novels such as <em><a href="Heart_of_Darkness" title="wikilink">Heart of Darkness</a></em>, however, &quot;Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="film-tv-and-theatrical-adaptations">Film, TV and theatrical adaptations</h2>
<p><em>And Then There Were None</em> has had more adaptations than any other single work of Christie's with the setting often being changed to locations other than an island and mostly utilising Christie's alternative ending from her 1943 stage play rather than that used in the book.</p>
<h3 id="stage">Stage</h3>
<p>In 1943, Agatha Christie <a href="And_Then_There_Were_None_(1943_play)" title="wikilink">adapted the story</a> for the stage. In the process of doing so, she realized that the novel's grim conclusion would not work dramatically on stage as there would be no one left to tell the tale, so she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love. Some of the names were also changed with General Macarthur becoming General McKenzie, probably due to the real-life <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">General Douglas MacArthur</a> who was playing a prominent role in the ongoing <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. On 14 October 2005, a new version of play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott opened at the <a href="Gielgud_Theatre" title="wikilink">Gielgud Theatre</a> in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the book version of story and restored the original ending where both Vera and Lombard die and Wargrave commits suicide.</p>
<h3 id="film">Film</h3>
<p>There have been several film adaptions of Agatha Christie's novel. The <a href="And_Then_There_Were_None_(1945_film)" title="wikilink">first</a> was adapted for the cinema screen in Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Clair's successful 1945 US production. The <a href="Ten_Little_Indians_(1965_film)" title="wikilink">second cinema adaptation</a> of the book was directed by George Pollock in 1965; Pollock had previously handled the four Miss Marple films starring <a href="Margaret_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Margaret Rutherford</a>. This film transferred the setting from a remote island to a mountain retreat in Austria. <a href="And_Then_There_Were_None_(1974_film)" title="wikilink">Another variant of <em>And Then There Were None</em> made in 1974</a> was the first colour English-language film version of the novel, directed by Peter Collinson from a screenplay by Peter Welbeck. This version was set in the <a href="Iran" title="wikilink">Iranian</a> desert. A version from the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">USSR</a>, <em><a href="Desyat_Negrityat" title="wikilink">Desyat' negrityat</a></em> (<em></em> &quot;Ten Little Negroes&quot;) (1987) was written and directed by <a href="Stanislav_Govorukhin" title="wikilink">Stanislav Govorukhin</a> and is the only cinema adaptation to use the novel's original ending. The most recent film, <a href="Ten_Little_Indians_(1989_film)" title="wikilink"><em>Ten Little Indians</em></a>, directed by <a href="Alan_Birkinshaw" title="wikilink">Alan Birkinshaw</a>, was made in 1989 and is set on the African <a href="safari" class="uri" title="wikilink">safari</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="Gumnaam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gumnaam</a></em> is a 1965 uncredited Bollywood adaptation set in a remote Indian location by the sea. Many elements, including musical dance numbers and a comic relief butler, were added to Christie's story in a film directed by Raja Nawathe from a screenplay by Dhruva Chatterjee. In addition, <em><a href="Five_Dolls_for_an_August_Moon" title="wikilink">5 Bambole per la Luna D'Agosto</a></em> (1970) is an uncredited <a href="giallo" class="uri" title="wikilink">giallo</a> adaptation by <a href="Mario_Bava" title="wikilink">Mario Bava</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-variations">Other variations</h3>
<p>The K.B.S. Productions Inc. film, <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> (1933), predates the publication of <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> and follows a strikingly similar plot.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Though it is a <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> movie, the movie bears no resemblance to <a href="Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="wikilink">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s original <a href="A_Study_in_Scarlet" title="wikilink">story of the same name</a>. In this case, the rhyme refers to &quot;Ten Little Black Boys&quot;. The author of the movie's screenplay, <a href="Robert_Florey" title="wikilink">Robert Florey</a>, &quot;doubted that [Christie] had seen <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her&quot;. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In addition, several parodies have been made. One, the 1976 Broadway musical <em><a href="Something&#39;s_Afoot" title="wikilink">Something's Afoot</a></em>, stars <a href="Tessie_O&#39;Shea" title="wikilink">Tessie O'Shea</a> as a female sleuth resembling Agatha Christie's fictional Miss Marple. <em>Something's Afoot</em> takes place in a remote English estate, where six guests have been invited for the weekend. The guests, as well as three servants and a young man who claims to have wandered innocently onto the estate, are then murdered one by one, several in full view of the audience, with the murderer's surprise identity revealed at the end. For an encore, the murdered cast members performed a song titled &quot;I Owe It All to Agatha Christie&quot;. Finally, an episode of <a href="Remington_Steele" title="wikilink">Remington Steele</a> called &quot;Steele Trap&quot; follows the plot very closely, with whimsical murders on a remote island. The Rene Clair film adaption is referenced several times.</p>
<h3 id="animated-variation">Animated variation</h3>
<p>An animated adaptation of sorts was made, replacing the characters with Marvel superheroes. Released in 1981, the episode, entitled &quot;Seven Little Superheroes&quot;, was possibly the most famous of the &quot;<a href="Spider-Man_and_his_Amazing_Friends" title="wikilink">Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends</a>&quot; series. Seven heroes are invited to an island-based castle, ostensibly for a party, by an unknown benefactor. However, in reality, it is an old arch-foe who seeks retribution for his past defeats at their hands.</p>
