<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Edmond Butler was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States as a young man. Shortly after arriving in <a href="Brooklyn,_New_York" title="wikilink">Brooklyn, New York</a>, he enlisted in the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a> and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the <a href="5th_U.S._Infantry" title="wikilink">5th U.S. Infantry</a> in October 1861. He was also assigned to special duty with the inspector of volunteer units in <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a> and <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>In 1862, he was sent to the <a href="New_Mexico_Territory" title="wikilink">New Mexico Territory</a> and later assisted in the reconstruction of <a href="Fort_Bliss,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Bliss</a> after its recapture by the Union. He was eventually reassigned to <a href="Fort_Wingate,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Fort Wingate, New Mexico</a> and, in 1865, commanded an expedition against the <a href="Navajo_people" title="wikilink">Navajos</a> living in <a href="Canyon_de_Chelly" title="wikilink">Canyon de Chelly</a>. Intercepting a Navajo raiding party under <a href="Manuelito_Grande" title="wikilink">Manuelito Grande</a>, he recovered a number of sheep and other livestock taken from the neighboring <a href="Apache" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apache</a>. After a period of 22-days, in which he had covered 720 miles, 31 Navajos were killed while another 27 were captured. He was also involved in the relocation of 3,000 Navajo to the <a href="Fort_Sumner_Reservation" title="wikilink">Fort Sumner Reservation</a> on the <a href="Pecos_River" title="wikilink">Pecos River</a>.</p>
<p>Transferred to Kansas in 1866, he spent two years there before being assigned to the <a href="Beecher_Island" title="wikilink">Beecher Island</a>-site in December 1868 to bring in the bodies of the soldiers killed during the <a href="Battle_of_Beecher_Island" title="wikilink">Battle of Beecher Island</a>. Despite a large Sioux presence in the area, Butler successfully removed the bodies from the site despite being <em>&quot;under the fire of the main body of Sioux&quot;</em>. However, he was unable to find the remains of Lieutenant <a href="Fredrick_H._Beecher" title="wikilink">Fredrick H. Beecher</a> and Acting Surgeon J.H. Mooer suggesting their bodies had been removed by the Sioux <em>&quot;probably in revenge for rifling Sioux graves on the Republican (earlier by camp followers)&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>During 1869, while assigned to guard the <a href="Fort_Wallace" title="wikilink">Fort Wallace</a>-<a href="Denver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denver</a> stage route, Bulter volunteered to join an expedition under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Charles_R._Woods" title="wikilink">Charles R. Woods</a> against the <a href="Pawnees" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pawnees</a>.</p>
<p>Returning to Kansas in October 1871, he was assigned to operations to control <em>&quot;organized land-leaguers&quot;</em> in the southeast. Three years later, he served with Lieutenant General <a href="Nelson_A._Miles" title="wikilink">Nelson A. Miles</a> during the <a href="Red_River_Campaign" title="wikilink">Red River Campaign</a> and in the <a href="Black_Hills_War" title="wikilink">Black Hills War</a> in which he led six companies in pursuit of <a href="Sitting_Bull" title="wikilink">Sitting Bull</a>. Although Sitting Bull and Gall escaped to Canada, he was involved in the capture of eight other Sioux chieftains and around 700 lodges.</p>
<p>On January 8, 1877, Butler took part in the engagement against the Sioux at Wolf Mountain. In command of Company C, he was commended for his actions during the battle for <em>&quot;conspicuous gallantry in leading his command against greatly superior numbers of hostile Indians, strongly entrenched&quot;</em> and receiving a brevet of <a href="Major_(United_States)" title="wikilink">major</a> and officially awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>Later that year, he escorted <a href="Chief_Joseph" title="wikilink">Chief Joseph</a> and other Nez Perce to <a href="Fort_Buford" title="wikilink">Fort Buford</a> between October-November 1877. During the early 1880s, he was stationed at <a href="Fort_Snelling,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Fort Snelling, Minnesota</a>, <a href="Fort_Keogh" title="wikilink">Fort Keogh, Montana</a> and guarded construction parties of the <a href="Northern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Northern Pacific Railroad</a>. He also held numerous staff positions and eventually awarded the rank of <a href="Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">lieutenant colonel</a> shortly before his retirement on March 9, 1891. He died in <a href="Trouville" title="wikilink">Trouville, France</a> three years later and, his body being returned to the United States, later buried in <a href="Holy_Sepulchre_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Holy Sepulchre Cemetery</a> in <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha, Nebraska</a>.</p>
