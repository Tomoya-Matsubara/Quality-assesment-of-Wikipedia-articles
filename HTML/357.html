<p><strong>Dalmore</strong> () was a country house and small <strong>estate</strong> in the Parish of <a href="Stair,_East_Ayrshire" title="wikilink">Stair, East Ayrshire</a>, on the <a href="River_Ayr" title="wikilink">River Ayr</a>, <a href="East_Ayrshire" title="wikilink">East Ayrshire</a>, Scotland<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The relatively small estate of Dalmore was originally part of the Barony of Gaitgirth (Gadgirth); Paterson recorded that the family of Scherar held the property in 1615; the Scherars (Shearer) were Burgesses of Ayr. The <a href="Earl_of_Stair" title="wikilink">Earl of Stair</a> held the property in 1696. In 1821 William Heron was the owner, followed by William Dunn in 1863. William was followed by his son James; William dying in 1830 and James in 1849.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> William Dunn was once the quarry manager and his wife, was Jessie Mckie (died 1913), her father being William McKie (died 1897), described as a quarryman. William McKie had obtained Dalmore House from the Heron's through inheritance.</p>
<p>An unusual joint memorial to the Herons, McKies and Dunns of Dalmore is located in the Stair cemetery close to the church.</p>

The Montgomerie family had five daughters and a son, John Cuninghame Montgomerie (died, Ayr, 1974). Placed on the Montgomerie grave are unusual oblong stone blocks with the inscriptions JHVD, 1930 (also carved on the memorial base); Maggie, 1965; Minnie (Williamina), 1966; and Isa (Isabella), 1968. A family exhibiting unusual longevity on the whole, with the parents living to 79 and 89; the children living to 41, 82, 81, 89 and 86.</p>
<p>John Cuninghame Montgomerie was born at Bruchag on the <a href="Isle_of_Bute" title="wikilink">Isle of Bute</a>; in the 1870s a Robert Montgomerie, who had occupied Bruchag farm left for <a href="Caldwell,_East_Renfrewshire" title="wikilink">Hall of Caldwell</a>, Renfrewshire and later Lessnessock, Ochiltree.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Robertson points out that the various branches of the 'Cunninghame' family spell their name differently, with Cunninghame for Glencairn and <a href="Corsehill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corsehill</a>; Cuninghame for Caddel and Monkredding; Cunningham for Baidland and <a href="Clonbeith_Castle" title="wikilink">Clonbeith</a>; and Cuningham for <a href="Glengarnock_Castle" title="wikilink">Glengarnock</a>.</p>
<p>Isabella Macalister Montgomerie may have received her <a href="MBE" class="uri" title="wikilink">MBE</a> for services to nursing during WW1; she suffered stress from her experiences for the rest of her life. She was named after her fraternal aunt, Isabella Montgomerie of Lessnessock.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The breed of Ayrshires, especially bulls from Lessnessock, had a world-wide reputation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dalmore-house">Dalmore House</h3>
<p><img src="Dalmore_Doocot,_Stair,_Ayrshire.JPG" title="fig:The old doocot." alt="The old doocot." /> The architect <a href="David_Bryce" title="wikilink">David Bryce</a> is recorded as having worked on Dalmore House prior to 1868 and this may be an earlier house to which alterations and extensions were made in the 1880s.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Dalmore House was completed in 1880-81 by the architects John and Robert Ingram for the Heron family. As shown by the illustration the house was an eccentric collection of styles, including Gothic, Tudor, French and Elizabethan styles.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The owners clearly had problems with the chimneys and smoke as can be seen from the highly unusual presence of metal pipe vents.</p>
<p>In 1916 a machinery shed and water supply were added.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <img src="Old_Toll_House_from_Dalmore_Lodge,_Stair,_Ayrshire.JPG" title="fig:The old Toll House on the local turnpike; looking towards Stair from Dalmore Lodge." alt="The old Toll House on the local turnpike; looking towards Stair from Dalmore Lodge." /> <img src="Dalmore_Dovecot_interior,_Stair,_Ayrshire.JPG" title="fig:Interior of the old Doocot." alt="Interior of the old Doocot." /></p>

<p>Dalmore House became unihabitable in the early 1960's, recognised as such after John Montgomerie moved into the property with his new and much younger wife, his ex-his secretary. The house was found to be riddled with dry rot and was condemned; John and his wife moved out and went to live in Sandfield Road, Ayr. John Montgomerie died in Ayr in 1974; as recorded on the family memorial in Stair cemetery.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>After the fire in April 1969 the stone walls of the house, the abandoned and ruinous entrance lodge and the still occupied stable cottages remain. The property is still owned by the Montgomerie family who are now based in Coylton.</p>
<p>On Blaeu's 1654 map the site is named 'Dalmoir'.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The name Dalmore may come from the Gaelic 'dail m&lt;U+00F2&gt;r', meaning 'big field'.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

By 1841, however, it was used only for the dressing of whetstone.</p>
<h3 id="coal">Coal</h3>
<p>The No 11 coal pit was near Dalmore Farm; Willie McIlwraith, a farmer there in later years, had a narrow escape when the shaft pit collapsed whilst he was ploughing over it. A Mowlum steam engine was used to sink the shaft in 1877 and this was later used at the Hone pit.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hone-stone">Hone stone</h3>
<p>Originally hone stones were taken from the river bed, however as early as 1789 a quarry for whetstone existed on the estate,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> producing whetstones known either as 'Water-of-Ayr' stone<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> or 'Tam o' Shanter' stone depending on their geological characteristics; The Hone Works themselves were situated west of the Stair Bridge. In 1789 a Mr Smith of Mauchline held the lease to one of the quarries; possibly the one situated near Stair Wood, beside the Glenstang Burn, as marked on the OS map. This Smith is well known for his families involvement in the famous 'Mauchline ware'.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Three buildings made up the Dalmore Mill complex, one of which is two-storeys high and partly unroofed due to vandalism in 2003. The works finally closed circa 1990, although some stone was still being worked in 2000.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> A suspension footbridge, dating from 1902, crosses the river to Milton Mill which was part of the complex.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <img src="Mauchline_Ware_hone_stone_case_-_upper_surface.JPG" title="fig:A Mauchline Ware hone stone case." alt="A Mauchline Ware hone stone case." width="200" /> The lade is still visible as a shallow ditch running from the river to the mill, a sluice originally controlling the water flow. A sizeable and unusual sculpture of a sheaf of corn with the name 'W Heron, 1821' is located on the mill wall, part of which was rebuilt after a German plane jettisoned incendiary bombs onto it in 1942. <img src="Dalmore_Holm,_Stair,_Ayrshire.JPG" title="fig:Dalmore holm and foundations of a structure beneath the mature trees." alt="Dalmore holm and foundations of a structure beneath the mature trees." width="200" /></p>
<p>The mill at Milton had originally been a woollen mill, opened on New Year's day 1830 by Mr. Heron of Dalmore House and working until 1908.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> William (1795 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1847) and Andrew (1797 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1869) Smith were sons of William Smith, a mason in Mauchline. In the 1820&lt;U+2019&gt;s it is recorded that the brothers were running a Hone stone factory at Milton Mill and it is thought that the Smith brothers diversified as Box Makers and established the famous <a href="Mauchline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauchline</a> Ware manufacture in the village of Mauchline because they wished to have their own source of cases for their 'Water of Ayr Stones'.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1857 Dalmore Mill was described as 'A hone mill worked by water-10 horse power-two storeys high, slated and in good repair'. In later years Dalmore Mill housed the offices and stores.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The stone from the aforementioned Dalmore Quarry was dressed and polished at the mill which was the property of William Dun Esq. of Dalmore House at that time.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="saw-mill">Saw mill</h3>
<p>A saw mill was present on the Dalmore Estate. The 1902 OS map shows a narrow gauge mineral railway running from Laigh Dalmore quarry to Dalmore Mill; a number of the old rails are stacked (2010) in the old quarry. The Victorian photograph of Enterkine shows the track in situ, although no railway sleepers are visible. Sidings may have been present.</p>
<h3 id="turnpikes">Turnpikes</h3>
<p>The old Ayr to Stair turnpike runs past the entrance to Dalmore House and the milestone is still located on the roadside verge near the entrance to Dalmore. The old toll house still stands beside the road down to Stair.</p>
<h3 id="views-of-the-tam-o-shanter-hone-works">Views of the Tam o' Shanter Hone works</h3>
<p>The works had been owned by the Heron family and their successors of Dalmore House. The house was directly connected to Dalmore Mill by a lane.</p>

<p>In 1883 Mrs Dunn of Dalmore presented Stair Church with two brass pulpit lamps which are still in perfect condition; later Mr Montgomerie gave two silver salvers to the church.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of groups of grind stones and unfinished hone stones were used as garden features around the old house. Old milestones were used to help protect the bridge piers fron the scouring action of the river and these can still be seen at times of low water.</p>
<p>David Wyper is on the 'Stair Role of Honour', having worked at the hone mill until he was old enough to joy the army in 1917. David was killed in 1918 at the battle of Flanders Field.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <img src="Dalmore,_Old_Tennis_court.JPG" title="fig:The site of the old tennis courts." alt="The site of the old tennis courts." width="200" /> <img src="Winter_Aconite,_Dalmore,_Stair,_Ayrshire.JPG" title="fig:Winter Aconite at Dalmore." alt="Winter Aconite at Dalmore." width="200" /> The hamlet of <a href="Stair,_East_Ayrshire" title="wikilink">Stair</a> lies next to the <a href="River_Ayr" title="wikilink">River Ayr</a> and consists of the Stair Inn, old converted mills, Stair Church, and Stair House.</p>
<p>Stair House, a late 16th / 17th century house lying beyond the church, was the birthplace of John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair. A category A listed building, it is still in use as a private dwelling.</p>
<p>The name Stair, previously written 'Stahar' or 'Stayhar', may come from the Gaelic 'Stair', meaning stepping-stones or a path over a bog.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 18th century, William Cunninghame of Enterkine held a <a href="F&lt;U+00EA&gt;te_champ&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00EA&gt;te champ&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre</a> below the house on the holm pictured in the view from the Dalmore House tower. Robert Burns recorded the event in one of his songs; William was apparently trying to impress the local landowners to increase his chances of being elected as MP for Ayrshire.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
