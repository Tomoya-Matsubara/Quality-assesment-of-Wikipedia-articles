<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>During the reign of the rulers of <a href="Jammu" title="wikilink">Jammu Shivaliks</a>, after 1765, there was a spurt in temple building activity in Jammu area, which continued during the early period of the 19th century. The rulers built spiral shaped temples with brick and crowned each tower with bright <a href="Kalasha" title="wikilink">Kalashas</a> in the shape of <a href="sikhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">sikhara</a> (rising tower). One such temple complex was started in 1822 (1835 is also mentioned) by <a href="Gulab_Singh" title="wikilink">Gulab Singh</a>, the ruler of Jammu and was dedicated to his <a href="guru" class="uri" title="wikilink">guru</a> Baba Prem Das. Its construction was completed in 1860 by his son Maharaja <a href="Ranbir_Singh" title="wikilink">Ranbir Singh</a>. However, according to an inscription in <a href="Brahmic_script" title="wikilink">Brahmic script</a> (<a href="Takri_alphabet" title="wikilink">Takri</a>) at the entrance of the temple, Gulab Singh and his brother Dhyan Singh are credited with building the temple in 1827 in honour of Mahant Jagannath.</p>

In the main shrine, the idol of Lord Rama, which is the family deity of the then king and the Dogra people, is deified in the <a href="garbhagriha" class="uri" title="wikilink">garbhagriha</a> (sanctum sanctorum). The shrine has a dome instead of the normal shikara in a pyramidal shape, which is in the Sikh architectural style. All the seven shrines have gold plated <a href="spire" title="wikilink">spires</a>. Gods and Goddesses enshrined in the seven shrines are all related to the epic Ramayana. In one of the shrines there is a <a href="Shiva_linga" title="wikilink">Shiva linga</a>, which is carved out of black stone and measures .<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The shrines are also enshrined with a very large number of <a href="Saligramas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saligramas</a> (fossil ammonite stones specially obtained from the <a href="Gandaki_river" title="wikilink">Gandaki river</a>, in <a href="Nepal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nepal</a> - a <a href="Vaishnava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaishnava</a> (Hindu) <a href="aniconic" class="uri" title="wikilink">aniconic</a> representation of Vishnu).

<p>A distinct feature noted in the entire temple complex is the <a href="stucco" class="uri" title="wikilink">stucco</a> style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on the internal and external faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.</p>
