<p>The <strong>Lebanon hostage crisis</strong> refers to the systematic kidnapping in <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a> of 96 foreign hostages of 21 national origins between 1982 and 1992. The victims were mostly from Western countries, and mostly journalists, diplomats, or teachers. 25 of them were Americans, 16 were Frenchmen, 12 Britons, 7 Swiss and 7 West Germans. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At least 10 hostages perished in captivity: some murdered and others died from lack of adequate medical attention to illnesses. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Those taking credit for the kidnapping used different names -- <a href="Islamic_Jihad" title="wikilink">Islamic Jihad</a>, <a href="Organization_for_the_Defense_of_Free_People" title="wikilink">Organization for the Defense of Free People</a>, <a href="Organization_for_the_Oppressed_of_the_Earth" title="wikilink">Organization for the Oppressed of the Earth</a>, <a href="Islamic_Jihad_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine</a>, etc. -- but the testimony of former hostages indicates almost all the &quot;groups&quot; were actually one group of &quot;a dozen men&quot; came &quot;from various ... clans&quot; within the <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> organization, &quot;most notably the Mughniyya and Hamadi clans.&quot; <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Particularly important in the organization was &quot;master terrorist&quot; <a href="Imad_Mughniyah" title="wikilink">Imad Mughniyah</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hezbollah has publicly denied involvement.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><img src="mugniyah.PNG" title="fig:Imad Mughniyah" alt="Imad Mughniyah" width="100" /> It is also widely believed that the Islamic Republic of <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> played a major role in the kidnappings. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The original reason for the hostage-taking seems to have been &quot;as insurance against retaliation by the U.S., Syria or any other force&quot; against Hezbollah, which is thought responsible for the killing of 230 Americans<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in the <a href="1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing" title="wikilink">Marine barracks</a> and <a href="April_1983_United_States_Embassy_bombing" title="wikilink">embassy bombings</a> in <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Other reasons for the kidnappings or the prolonged holding of hostages are thought to be &quot;primarily based on Iranian foreign policy calculations and interests&quot; particularly the extraction of &quot;political, military and financial concessions from the Western world,&quot; <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the hostage takers being strong allies of the <a href="Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" title="wikilink">Islamic Republic of Iran</a>.</p>
<p>The tight security measures taken by the hostage-keepers succeeded in preventing not only Western sources but even Syrian intelligence (which helped the Western countries at times) from locating and rescuing all but a handful of hostages. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Frustration with the situation, along with public pressure from the media and families of the hostages led to a breakdown of the anti-terrorism principle of &quot;no negotiations, no concessions&quot; by American and French officials. In particular the <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> administration in the United States negotiated a secret and illegal arms for hostage swap with Iran known as the <a href="Iran-Contra_Affair" title="wikilink">Iran-Contra Affair</a>.</p>
<p>The hostage crisis ended with the need for Western aid and investment by Syria and Iran following the end of the <a href="Iran-Iraq_war" title="wikilink">Iran-Iraq war</a> and collapse of the Soviet Union, and with the promises to Hezbollah that would could remain armed following the end of the Lebanese Civil War and that France and America would not seek revenge against it. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="TWA_Flight_847" title="wikilink">TWA Flight 847</a>. One of the most dramatic hostage-takings in Lebanon occurred on June 14, 1985, when TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked by &quot;Organization for the Oppressed of the Earth.&quot; Passengers underwent a three-day,  ordeal shuttling back and forth between Beirut and Algiers. Groups of passengers were freed over the course of event. One passenger, a U.S. Navy diver, <a href="Robert_Dean_Stethem" title="wikilink">Robert Dean Stethem</a>, was beaten, shot and his body dumped on the runway. Another 39 passengers were held hostage in the South Beirut for two weeks, as Lebanese army troops withdrew from the Beirut airport on June 16th leaving Hezbollah and Amal militias to control the area and hold the hostages. On June 30, they were driven to Syria and released. The liberation of the hostages was followed over the next several weeks by the release of 735 Lebanese Shiite militants by Israel. Although this was one of the key demands of the hijackers, Israel maintaining the release was unconnected to the hijacking. <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="victims">Victims</h2>
<p>With the exception of a few hostages such as CIA Bureau Chief William Francis Buckley and Marine Colonel William Higgins, (who were both killed) most of the hostages were chosen not for any political activity or alleged misdeeds they had committed, but because of the country they came from and the ease of kidnapping them. Despite this, they were often treated quite cruelly, with repeated beatings and mock executions.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of the more famous victims include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="David_S._Dodge" title="wikilink">David S. Dodge</a>. Perhaps the first victim whose case was widely publicized was <a href="American_University_of_Beirut" title="wikilink">American University of Beirut</a> president David Dodge, abducted 19 July 1982 and freed in July 21, 1983. According to Lebanese journalist Hala Jaber, &quot;Dodge was abducted initially by pro-Palestinian Lebanese&quot; in hopes of pressuring the Americans to pressure Israel which had invaded Lebanon to stop Lebanon-based <a href="PLO" class="uri" title="wikilink">PLO</a> attacks. After the PLO evacuated Lebanon, &quot;the Iranians had taken charge of&quot; Dodge and moved him from Beqaa valley to Tehran. The Iranians hoped to use Dodge to gain the release of three Iranian officials who had been kidnapped by Christian militia Lebanese Forces in July 1982.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<dl>

<dd>Dodge &quot;spent the next three months in the infamous Evin jail, where the <a href="Iranian_Revolutionary_Guard" title="wikilink">Iranian Revolutionary Guard</a> had executed hundreds of the Shah's followers in the wake of Khomeini's Islamic Revolution. Whenever he was interrogated, he was asked for information about the missing Iranians.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Dodge was released on the first anniversary of his abduction, reportedly because Syrian President Assad was &quot;enraged by Iran's role in the abduction&quot;. Dodge &quot;was taken out of his cell, given back the clothes he had worn on the day of his abduction, and driven back to the airport by an official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. From there he flew first class to Syria. ... At Damascus airport his escort handed him over to a waiting car ... the following morning he was handed over to the American embassy.&quot; <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>

<li><a href="Benjamin_Weir" title="wikilink">Benjamin Weir</a>. The Presbyterian minister was kidnapped in May 1984 by three armed men while strolling with his wife. Weir may have thought he was safe from harm from Muslims because he lived in Shiite West Beirut working &quot;closely with various Muslim-oriented charity and relief groups,&quot; and had lived in Lebanon since 1958. Two days after his abduction, a telephone message claimed: &quot;Islamic Jihad organization claims it is responsible for the abduction ... in order to renew our acceptance of Reagan's challenge [to fight &quot;state terrorism&quot;] and to confirm our commitment of the statement ... that we will not leave any American on Lebanese soil.&quot; <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was released mid-September 1985.</li>

Before his release in November 1991 he was frequently blindfolded, beaten, and subjected to mock executions.

<h2 id="perpetrators">Perpetrators</h2>
<p>Many other &quot;groups&quot; claimed responsibility for the kidnappings while <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> denied it, indignantly proclaiming in 1987:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We look with ridicule at the accusations of Hezbollah in connection with the abductions of foreign hostages. We consider that is a provocation and hold America responsible for the results. <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless Hezbollah, sometimes described as the &quot;umbrella group&quot; of Shia radicalism in Lebanon, is considered by most observers to be the instigator of the crisis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the hostage-crisis in Lebanon yields that Hezbollah was undisputably responsible for the aforementioned abductions of Westerners despite attempts to shield its complicity through the employment of cover-names. Its organisational framework was not only sophisticated an assimilated according to Iranian clerical designs but also closely integrated with several key Iranian institutions which provided it with both necessary weaponry and training to successfully confront self-proclaimed Islamic enemies and invaluable financial support ... <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Another source claims that with the exceptions of six Iranians, all the hostages appear to have been seized by &quot;groups allied with Iran.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>According to scholar Gilles Kepel &quot;a few of the kidnappings were money-driven or linked to local concerns, but most obeyed a logic whereby Hezbollah itself was no more than a subcontractor for Iranian intiatives.&quot; <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Motivation for the hostage-taking includes:</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>By 1991 radical Shia operatives imprisoned in Europe had been freed. Islamic Dawa party members convicted of terrorism in Kuwait had been freed by Iraqi Invasion. There was no need to pressure Western supporters of the Iraq because Iran-Iraq War was over. It was pretty well established that the four missing Iranians were no longer alive. <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>More importantly Iran was in need of foreign investment &quot;to repair its economy and infrastructure after the destruction of the Iran-Iraq War, and Syria needed to &quot;consolidation of its hegemony over Lebanon&quot; and obtain to Western aid to compensate for the loss of Soviet support following the collapse of the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Syria was actively pressuring Hezbollah to stop the abductions and a February 1987 attack by Syrian troops in Beirut that killed 23 members of Hezbollah was in part an expression of Syrian irritation with the continued hostage-taking. <a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Hezbollah had guarantees from Syria that despite the end of the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Lebanese Civil War</a>, it would be allowed to remain armed, while all other Lebanese militias would be disarmed, on the grounds that Hezbollah needed its weapons to fight Israeli occupation in the South. <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
