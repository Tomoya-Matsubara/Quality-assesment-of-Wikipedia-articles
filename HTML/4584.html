<p>The <strong>music of Minnesota</strong> has played a role in the historical and cultural development of <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a>. As with the culture of Minnesota in general, the state's music scene centers on the <a href="Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" title="wikilink">Minneapolis-Saint Paul</a> area, and most of the Minnesotan artists who have become nationally popular either came from that area or debuted there. Rural Minnesota has also produced a flourishing folk music scene, with a long tradition of traditional <a href="music_of_Sweden" title="wikilink">Swedish</a>, <a href="music_of_Finland" title="wikilink">Finnish</a> and <a href="music_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Norwegian music</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Minnesota's modern local music scene is home to thousands of local bands, many of which perform with some regularity.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some performers from nearby regions of neighboring states, such as western Wisconsin and Fargo, North Dakota, are often considered a part of the Minnesota music scene.</p>
<p>Minneapolis has produced a number of famous performers, such as <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, who was born in Duluth, grew up in Hibbing, and began his musical career in the Minneapolis area, and <a href="Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a>, who eventually formed <a href="The_Time_(band)" title="wikilink">The Time</a> and <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">produced</a> for <a href="Gladys_Knight" title="wikilink">Gladys Knight</a> and <a href="Janet_Jackson" title="wikilink">Janet Jackson</a>. Minneapolis' most influential contributions to <a href="American_popular_music" title="wikilink">American popular music</a> began in the 1970s and 1980s, when the city's music scene &quot;expanded the state's cultural identity&quot; and launched the careers of acclaimed performers like the multi-platinum <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul</a> singer <a href="Prince_(artist)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>, and cult favorites <a href="The_Replacements" title="wikilink">The Replacements</a> and <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a>.

<p>Many local performers record for one of several regional labels in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state. Some of these labels are well-known in their field, such as <a href="Red_House_Records" title="wikilink">Red House</a>, a prominent folk label, and the Twin/Tone indie rock label. In addition to record labels, Minneapolis has been home to several important recording studios. The first studio in the state was <a href="Kay_Bank" title="wikilink">Kay Bank</a>, established by studio engineer <a href="Bruce_Swedien" title="wikilink">Bruce Swedien</a> in the 1950s; the studio's first hits were from <a href="The_Trashmen" title="wikilink">The Trashmen</a> (&quot;Surfin' Bird&quot;) and <a href="Dave_Dudley" title="wikilink">Dave Dudley</a> (&quot;Six Days on the Road&quot;), which helped popularize a distinctive Kay Bank style based on using three-track recording and echo effects. <a href="Herb_Pilhofer" title="wikilink">Herb Pilhofer</a> and <a href="Tom_Jung" title="wikilink">Tom Jung</a> worked at Kay Banks before founding <a href="Sound_80" title="wikilink">Sound 80</a> in 1969.

<h3 id="venues">Venues</h3>
<p><img src="First_Avenue-Minneapolis-2005-05-18.jpg" title="fig:First Avenue nightclub" alt="First Avenue nightclub" /> Large venues frequently hosting widely popular national music acts in Minnesota include the <a href="Target_Center" title="wikilink">Target Center</a>, <a href="Xcel_Energy_Center" title="wikilink">Xcel Energy Center</a>, and, more rarely due to poor <a href="acoustics" class="uri" title="wikilink">acoustics</a>, the <a href="Metrodome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metrodome</a>.</p>
<p>The most influential small musical venue in the state is <a href="First_Avenue" title="wikilink">First Avenue</a>, a nightclub that initially opened (as <em>The Depot</em>) in 1970; it was soon renamed <em>Uncle Sam's</em>, and became a franchise of the <a href="American_Events_Company" title="wikilink">American Events Company</a>, before finally becoming <em>First Avenue</em> in 1978. It's central location in the heart of downtown on 1st Avenue and historic value of launching renown acts such as <a href="Prince,_musician" title="wikilink">Prince</a> solidifies its importance in the current local scene and in Minnesota music history.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

Just outside of St. Paul in <a href="Maplewood,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Maplewood</a> there are The Rock, and <a href="Myth_Nightclub" title="wikilink">Myth Nightclub</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990, Prince opened The Quest (then under a different name) in downtown's Warehouse District and the club built a reputation of booking the best local and national acts, competing directly with First Avenue. With a string of misfortunes in the early 2000s, it closed indefinitely by 2007.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

The <a href="Dakota_Jazz_Club" title="wikilink">Dakota Jazz Club</a> on <a href="Nicollet_Mall" title="wikilink">Nicollet Mall</a> offers the region's best jazz. Along with collegiate music, choral and opera productions, <a href="Northrop_Auditorium" title="wikilink">Northrop Auditorium</a> on the <a href="University_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">University of Minnesota</a> campus sometimes hosts up and coming national acts to appeal to a college-aged crowd but has a limited capacity of less than 5,000.</p>
<p>The region also contains youth music venues, many of which operate as youth centers by day.

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p><a href="Music_education" title="wikilink">Music education</a> is part of the curriculum at Minnesota public schools. All students take music at the <a href="elementary_school" title="wikilink">elementary</a> and <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">middle school</a> ages, and many choose to take it as an elective in high school, where schools often organize <a href="marching_band" title="wikilink">marching bands</a>, <a href="choir" title="wikilink">choruses</a> or other performance opportunities. The <a href="Perpich_Center_for_Arts_Education" title="wikilink">Perpich Center for Arts Education</a> is a school of choice which draws students from all over the state and has an extensive modern and classical music education program. <a href="Higher_education" title="wikilink">Higher education</a> in music is an important part of the programs at several of Minnesota's <a href="university" title="wikilink">universities</a>, including the <a href="University_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">University of Minnesota</a>, which offers the Bachelors of Music degree in music education, <a href="music_therapy" title="wikilink">therapy</a> or performance, and graduate degrees in education, <a href="conducting" class="uri" title="wikilink">conducting</a> and <a href="musicology" class="uri" title="wikilink">musicology</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="McNally_Smith_College_of_Music" title="wikilink">McNally Smith College of Music</a>, a preeminent college of contemporary music based in <a href="Saint_Paul,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Saint Paul</a>, offers Bachelors of Music in music <a href="performance" class="uri" title="wikilink">performance</a> and <a href="music_business" title="wikilink">music business</a>, as well as Associates Degrees and diploma programs in <a href="recording_technology" title="wikilink">recording technology</a>.</p>
<p>Elementary school music education introduces elements of music like <a href="melody" class="uri" title="wikilink">melody</a>, <a href="rhythm" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhythm</a> and <a href="harmony" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmony</a>, and examines the music of a &quot;variety of cultures and historical times&quot;. Students are expected to perform simply melodies and rhythms and perform songs and on instruments, and to use <a href="musical_notation" title="wikilink">musical notation</a>. Older students are exposed to more complex forms of music, and more scholarly approaches to music education. Middle school students further learn about &quot;the connection between a work of music, its purpose, and its cultural and historical contexts&quot; and comparisons between music and other art forms. Students also perform and listen to music, and are expected to evaluate performances using personal feelings and objective criteria. At the high school level, performance, critical and scholarly expectations are higher and more complex, and may require participation in extracurricular programs like a school band or chorus.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Music in Minnesota extends prior to historical documentation, with the <a href="Native_American_music" title="wikilink">music of the Native Americans</a> of the area. The <a href="Dakota_music" title="wikilink">Dakota musical</a> traditions of what is now Minnesota are generally based around vocal, percussive and dance music; folk songs among the Dakota can be celebratory, martial or ceremonial.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> European settlers to Minnesota brought their own tradition of folk and classical music, especially choral and Christian-themed music, opera, and various kinds of ethnic folk music, most prominently including Scandinavian styles. Traditional dance music is based mostly around <a href="schottisch" title="wikilink">schottisches</a>, <a href="polka" title="wikilink">polkas</a> and <a href="waltz" title="wikilink">waltzes</a> with instrumentation including <a href="fiddle" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiddle</a>, <a href="button-box" class="uri" title="wikilink">button-box</a>, <a href="mandola" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandola</a>, <a href="accordion" class="uri" title="wikilink">accordion</a> and <a href="banjo" class="uri" title="wikilink">banjo</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The first singing school in Minnesota was in St. Anthony (now part of Minneapolis), opened in 1851. Later in the century, the Plymouth Congregational Church of Minneapolis began a singing group in 1857, followed by the first such club for women only, the Lorelei Club (later the <em>Ladies' Thursday Musical Chorus</em>), in 1892.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="MacPhail.jpg" title="fig:1920 image from the MacPhail Center for Music yearbook" alt="1920 image from the MacPhail Center for Music yearbook" width="200" /> Thousands of <a href="Norwegian_people" title="wikilink">Norwegians</a> settled in Minnesota between 1825 and 1925. Subcultures formed based around village of origin (<em>bygde</em>), and then formed organizations to maintain their home dialect and musical traditions. These organizations held annual meetings (<em>stevne</em>) which featured folk dancing, singing, fiddling and poetry. In the late 1860s, male choirs with primarily Norwegian and Swedish singers formed in cities and Lutheran colleges in Minnesota. These choirs sang a variety of popular and patriotic songs, hymns and folk tunes. In the 1880s, these choirs inspired the organization of singing societies that sponsored music festivals; the largest of these singing societies is the <a href="Norwegian_Singers_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Norwegian Singers Association of America</a> and the <a href="Union_of_Scandinavian_Singers" title="wikilink">Union of Scandinavian Singers</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The end of the 19th century also saw the foundation of two long-running music groups, the <a href="Thursday_Musical_Chorus" title="wikilink">Thursday Musical Chorus</a> and the <a href="Apollo_Men&#39;s_Musical_Group" title="wikilink">Apollo Men's Musical Group</a>. Two of the most important Minnesota institutions were founded in the early 20th century, namely the MacPhail School of Violin (1907, later becoming the <a href="MacPhail_Center_for_Music" title="wikilink">MacPhail Center for Music</a>) and the <a href="Minneapolis_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra</a> (1903, later the <a href="Minnesota_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Minnesota Orchestra</a>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Minneapolis became a home for <a href="vaudeville" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaudeville</a>, especially Scandinavian-American vaudeville. This field was known as <em>bondkomik</em> (Norwegian) or <em>bondkomiker</em> (Swedish), and featured multi-act plays, dances, songs and monologues. Vaudeville shows usually ended with social dancing. Minneapolis' most famous performers were the <a href="Olson_sisters" title="wikilink">Olson sisters</a>, <a href="Hjalmar_Peterson" title="wikilink">Hjalmar Peterson</a> and Ernest and Clarence Iverson (<a href="Slim_Jim_&amp;_the_Vagabond_Kid" title="wikilink">Slim Jim &amp; the Vagabond Kid</a>). After World War 1, Scandinavian musical pride diminished, a process accelerated by economic decline in the 1930s; rural and regional dance music slowly died out and became largely unknown. During this era, however, the <em><a href="Leikarring" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leikarring</a></em> movement began, which celebrated national Norwegian folk dance and song through musical societies like Minnesota's <em>Norrona Leikarring</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Around the time of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the <a href="Andrews_Sisters" title="wikilink">Andrews Sisters</a> from Minneapolis were very popular. Today they are perhaps best known for the song &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,&quot; which was <a href="cover_version" title="wikilink">covered</a> by <a href="Bette_Midler" title="wikilink">Bette Midler</a> decades later.

These ethnic communities frequently settled near each other, in Minnesota and in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota and South Dakota, and their musical and cultural identities grew blurred. Norwegians and Swedes very frequently lived near each other in Minnesota, for example, and their music merged into a perceived Scandinavian identity, rather than uniquely Swedish or Norwegian. Their music is perceived as <em><a href="old-time_music" title="wikilink">old-time music</a></em>, and is also influenced by the area's German, Irish, English, Polish and other Northern and Central European musics.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Norwegian folk dance (<em>bygdedanser</em>) includes participatory social dances and performance dances like <em>springar</em>, <em>springdans</em>, <em>pols</em>, <em>rull</em> and <em>halling</em>. The Norwegian <em><a href="gammeldans" class="uri" title="wikilink">gammeldans</a></em> tradition continues in ethnic communities in Minnesota, where <a href="two-step" title="wikilink">two-steps</a>, <a href="waltz" title="wikilink">waltzes</a>, <a href="polka" title="wikilink">polkas</a>, <a href="schottische" title="wikilink">schottisches</a> and <a href="mazurka" title="wikilink">mazurkas</a> are know as <em><a href="old-time_music" title="wikilink">old-time music</a></em>. Vocal music includes short poetic songs called <em>stev</em>, <a href="emigrant_ballad" title="wikilink">emigrant ballads</a> which expressed nostalgia for Norway and express hope, despair and loss about life in the United States. Musical accompaniment includes the <a href="accordion" class="uri" title="wikilink">accordion</a>, <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a>, <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a>, <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a>, <a href="organ_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">organ</a>, <a href="banjo" class="uri" title="wikilink">banjo</a> and <a href="mandolin" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandolin</a>.

The modern music scene includes <a href="rock_(music)" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> and <a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic music</a>, and is especially known for <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> and <a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore</a>. Prior to the evolution of punk in the 1970s, there was little rock and roll tradition from Minneapolis, which author Steven Blush attributed to a lack of anything to &quot;rebel against&quot;, noting that it was Minneapolis' friendly atmosphere that made future hardcore punk musicians &quot;crazy and rebellious&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The first rock band from Minneapolis to achieve national prominence was the <a href="surf_rock" title="wikilink">surf rock</a> group <a href="The_Trashmen" title="wikilink">The Trashmen</a> who formed in 1962 and had a hit two years later with &quot;Surfin' Bird&quot;. That song, along with <a href="Dave_Dudley" title="wikilink">Dave Dudley</a>'s &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot;, helped to establish the <a href="Kay_Banks" title="wikilink">Kay Banks</a> studio, which would go on to record bands like <a href="The_Guess_Who" title="wikilink">The Guess Who</a> and would become known for a distinctive sound characterized by three-track recording and the use of echo effects. <a href="Dove_(recording_studio)" title="wikilink">Dove Studios</a> was another prominent studio in the 60s, known for releasing a series of psychedelic and garage rock singles that have become collector's items, including <a href="Calico_Wall" title="wikilink">Calico Wall</a>'s &quot;Flight Reaction&quot; and <a href="The_Litter" title="wikilink">The Litter</a>'s <em>Distortions</em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Bob Dylan, a <a href="Hibbing,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Hibbing</a> native, became the first major mainstream solo star from Minnesota in the 1960s, known for his unique lyricism and <a href="folk-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">folk-rock</a> style. He spent a brief period in Minneapolis, attending the University of Minnesota, where he played free shows on the West Bank of the <a href="University_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">University of Minnesota</a> Minneapolis campus. He was associated with <a href="Dinkytown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dinkytown</a>, the local center for young fans of folk music, where he listened to a wide variety of folk and blues. The city's local folk scene produced a few well-known performers in the 1960s, besides Dylan, who spent much of his early career based out New York; these include the guitarist <a href="Leo_Kottke" title="wikilink">Leo Kottke</a> and the trio <a href="Koerner,_Ray_&amp;_Glover" title="wikilink">Koerner, Ray &amp; Glover</a>. Folk music continues to be a major part of the Minnesota music scene, and is broadcast by the <em><a href="Prairie_Home_Companion" title="wikilink">Prairie Home Companion</a></em>, a radio show hosted by author <a href="Garrison_Keillor" title="wikilink">Garrison Keillor</a>; the <a href="Red_House_Records" title="wikilink">Red House</a> record label is the most influential local label, and releases records by <a href="Peter_Ostroushko" title="wikilink">Peter Ostroushko</a> and <a href="Greg_Brown_(folk_musician)" title="wikilink">Greg Brown</a>, among others.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>These influences contributed to the rise of <a href="punk_music" title="wikilink">punk</a> rockers <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a>, <a href="Soul_Asylum" title="wikilink">Soul Asylum</a>, <a href="the_Replacements" title="wikilink">the Replacements</a>, and the <a href="rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">rhythm and blues</a> stylings of <a href="The_Time_(band)" title="wikilink">Morris Day and the Time</a> and <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a> in the 1980s.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> R&amp;B mega-producing team <a href="Jimmy_Jam_&amp;_Terry_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis</a> have origins in the Twin Cities, and jazz musician <a href="Lester_Young" title="wikilink">Lester Young</a> lived there for a time in his youth.</p>
<p>These later sources brought the Minneapolis music scene to national attention; the period from about 1977 to 1987 was a period of incredible dynamism in the Minneapolis music scene, with offshoots in the punk scene including Soul Asylum, <a href="Babes_in_Toyland_(band)" title="wikilink">Babes in Toyland</a>, the Clams and many other seminal favorites, while Prince's immense power in the industry (which peaked during this period) created a rhythm and blues mini-empire at his <a href="Paisley_Park_Studios" title="wikilink">Paisley Park Studios</a>, based in suburban <a href="Chanhassen,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Chanhassen</a>.</p>
<p>Contemporary local artists continue to enjoy critical acclaim such as <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip-hop</a> duo <a href="Atmosphere_(music_group)" title="wikilink">Atmosphere</a> and frontman <a href="Slug_(rapper)" title="wikilink">Slug</a>'s label <a href="Rhymesayers_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Rhymesayers Entertainment</a>, the smaller <a href="Doomtree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doomtree</a>, and commercially successful pop-rockers <a href="Semisonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semisonic</a>. While things have slowed considerably, the Twin Cities are still the region's musical hotbed. More recently, the music scene has showed signs of revival with the success of the Minneapolis-based rock bands <a href="Motion_City_Soundtrack" title="wikilink">Motion City Soundtrack</a>, <a href="Tapes_&#39;n_Tapes" title="wikilink">Tapes 'n Tapes</a>, and <a href="Quietdrive" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quietdrive</a>. The area has also shown an unusual affinity for certain artists. For instance, while largely unnoticed on their home turf in New York City, the Twin Cities accounted for the majority of national sales for <a href="Soul_Coughing" title="wikilink">Soul Coughing</a>'s second album <em><a href="Irresistible_Bliss" title="wikilink">Irresistible Bliss</a></em> during its first eight weeks of release; this followed from the fledgling fan base that Soul Coughing found here while touring for their first effort, <em><a href="Ruby_Vroom" title="wikilink">Ruby Vroom</a></em>. </p>
<h3 id="rb">R&amp;B</h3>

<p>Minneapolis became noted as a center for R&amp;B in the 1980s, when the singing star <a href="Prince_Rogers_Nelson" title="wikilink">Prince</a> rose to fame. The city had little history in African American popular music, like R&amp;B, until Prince debuted in 1978. He became the first architect of the <em>Minneapolis sound</em>, a <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> and <a href="disco" class="uri" title="wikilink">disco</a>-influenced style of R&amp;B, and inspired a legion of subsequent performers, including <a href="The_Time" title="wikilink">The Time</a>, <a href="Wendy_&amp;_Lisa" title="wikilink">Wendy &amp; Lisa</a> and <a href="Vanity_Six" title="wikilink">Vanity Six</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1980, a group of session musicians, recording as <a href="Lipps_Inc." title="wikilink">Lipps Inc.</a>, recorded the song &quot;Funkytown&quot; at <a href="Sound_80_Studios" title="wikilink">Sound 80 Studios</a>. The song launched the <a href="record_production" title="wikilink">record production</a> careers of <a href="Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a>, whose <a href="Flyte_Tyme_Productions" title="wikilink">Flyte Tyme Productions</a> helped define the Minneapolis sound. The pair's first big break was <a href="Janet_Jackson" title="wikilink">Janet Jackson</a>'s <em><a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Control</a></em> in 1986, which launched her career and spawned numerous projects between Jam and Lewis with artists as varied as <a href="Mint_Condition" title="wikilink">Mint Condition</a>, <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Sounds_of_Blackness" title="wikilink">Sounds of Blackness</a>, <a href="New_Edition" title="wikilink">New Edition</a>, <a href="Alexander_O&#39;Neal" title="wikilink">Alexander O'Neal</a>, <a href="Cherrelle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherrelle</a>, <a href="The_S.O.S._Band" title="wikilink">The S.O.S.

<h3 id="rock">Rock</h3>
<p>In the mid-1970s, the local music scene in the Minneapolis area began producing popular and innovative acts. Many signed to major record labels, and by the mid 1980s, had achieved national prominence. The first may have been <a href="Lipps_Inc" title="wikilink">Lipps Inc</a>, who gained some popularity in the late 1970s during the <a href="disco" class="uri" title="wikilink">disco</a> era with the global hit &quot;<a href="Funkytown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funkytown</a>&quot; (though the song itself was not in the rock genre). <a href="The_Suburbs" title="wikilink">The Suburbs</a> also formed around the same time. They were the first group to be released under the local <a href="Twin/Tone_Records" title="wikilink">Twin/Tone Records</a> label in 1978. Largely only known locally, the group developed a <a href="New_Wave_music" title="wikilink">New Wave</a> sound in the 1980s and opened for national acts such as <a href="Iggy_Pop" title="wikilink">Iggy Pop</a> and <a href="The_B-52&#39;s" title="wikilink">The B-52's</a>.         Originally based out of <a href="Jay&#39;s_Longhorn_Bar" title="wikilink">Jay's Longhorn Bar</a>, the <a href="Minneapolis_hardcore" title="wikilink">Minneapolis hardcore punk</a> scene grew slowly. <a href="The_Suicide_Commandos" title="wikilink">The Suicide Commandos</a> were perhaps first, and they were quickly followed by <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a> and <a href="The_Replacements" title="wikilink">The Replacements</a>, who started as <a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore punk</a> bands and became pivotal in the development of <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a>. The Replacements eventually achieved some limited mainstream success, while H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt; became the first hardcore outfit to sign to a major label. <a href="Soul_Asylum" title="wikilink">Soul Asylum</a> was originally a Minneapolis hardcore band called Loud Fast Rules, which played with bands like <a href="Man_Sized_Action" title="wikilink">Man Sized Action</a>, <a href="Rifle_Sport" title="wikilink">Rifle Sport</a> and <a href="Breaking_Circus" title="wikilink">Breaking Circus</a> who mixed <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a>, <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> and other influences.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The Twin Cities rock scene had fully come to national prominence by 1984, when the <em><a href="Village_Voice" title="wikilink">Village Voice</a></em>'s renowned critics poll, Pazz and Jop, named three Minneapolis recordings among the top ten of the year: Prince's <em><a href="Purple_Rain" title="wikilink">Purple Rain</a></em>, The Replacements' <em><a href="Let_It_Be_(Replacements_album)" title="wikilink">Let It Be</a></em>, and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;'s <em><a href="Zen_Arcade" title="wikilink">Zen Arcade</a></em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The late 1980s saw new sounds coming out of the state, when <a href="Information_Society" title="wikilink">Information Society</a> came to the attention of <a href="nightclub" title="wikilink">nightclubs</a> and record labels in <a href="New_York,_New_York" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. The group had formed in 1982 at <a href="Macalester_College" title="wikilink">Macalester College</a> in St. Paul and made an initial release on the local Wide Angle Records label two years later. &quot;What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; became a huge hit in 1988, and they continued to make music through most of the 1990s. Beginning in 1986, <a href="The_Jayhawks" title="wikilink">The Jayhawks</a> began recording, achieving critical acclaim with a modern <a href="folk-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">folk-rock</a> sound.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Another group to form around the same time was <a href="Babes_in_Toyland_(band)" title="wikilink">Babes in Toyland</a>, an early <a href="riot_grrl" title="wikilink">riot grrl</a> band that saw moderate popularity through the 1990s as well. They toured with <a href="Lollapalooza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lollapalooza</a> in 1993. Many groups of the 1980s and 1990s eventually split up, and a number of other bands formed from the remnants. <a href="Bob_Mould" title="wikilink">Bob Mould</a> left H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt; to head <a href="Sugar_(band)" title="wikilink">Sugar</a> and do solo projects. <a href="Trip_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Trip Shakespeare</a> eventually transformed into <a href="Semisonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semisonic</a>, who gained popularity in the late 1990s. A former member of Semisonic met up with another from Trip Shakespeare to form <a href="The_Flops" title="wikilink">The Flops</a>.</p>

Also recently, the Twin Cities <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> scene owes some of its success to the annual <a href="Twin_Cities_Celebration_of_Hip_Hop" title="wikilink">Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop</a> founded by Larry Lucio, Jr. &amp; <a href="Toki_Wright" title="wikilink">Toki Wright</a> and sponsored by <a href="YO!_The_Movement" title="wikilink">YO!

<p>Minnesota is home to a burgeoning <a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic music</a> scene in the area, though the genre tends to get little radio airplay in the state.
