<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Originally formed in California in 1939, Northrop Corporation was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. In 1994, Northrop Aircraft merged with <a href="Grumman_Aerospace" title="wikilink">Grumman Aerospace</a> to create the company Northrop Grumman. Both companies were previously established in the airplane manufacturing industry, and Grumman was famous for building the <a href="Apollo_Lunar_Module" title="wikilink">Apollo Lunar Module</a>. The new company acquired <a href="Northrop_Grumman_Electronic_Systems" title="wikilink">Westinghouse Electronic Systems</a> in 1996, a major manufacturer of radar systems. Logicon, a defense computer contractor, was added in 1997. Previously, Logicon had acquired Geodynamics Corporation in March 1996 and Syscon Corporation in February 1995.</p>
<p>A merger between Northrop Grumman and competitor <a href="Lockheed_Martin" title="wikilink">Lockheed Martin</a> was not approved by the U.S. government in 1998, slowing the consolidation of the defense industry. But in 1999, the company acquired <a href="Ryan_Aeronautical_Company" title="wikilink">Teledyne Ryan</a>, which developed surveillance systems and unmanned aircraft. It also acquired California Microwave, Inc., and Data Procurement Corporation, in the same year. Other entities acquired included Xetron Corporation (1996), Inter-National Research Institute Inc. (1998), Federal Data Corporation (2000), Navia Aviation As (2000), Comptek Research, Inc. (2000), and Sterling Software, Inc. (2000).</p>
<p>In 1999, Northrop Grumman and <a href="SAIC_(company)" title="wikilink">SAIC</a> created <a href="AMSEC_LLC" title="wikilink">AMSEC LLC</a> as a joint venture, which grew &quot;from $100 million in revenue in 2000 to approximately $500 million in fiscal year 2007.&quot; <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2001 the company acquired <a href="Litton_Industries" title="wikilink">Litton Industries</a>, a shipbuilder and provider of defense electronics systems to the <a href="U.S._Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a>. During the acquisition process, a new Delaware holding company, <a href="NNG,_Inc." title="wikilink">NNG, Inc.</a>, was formed. It merged with Northrop Grumman through a one-for-one common shares exchange in April 2001. Both Northrop Grumman and Litton became subsidiaries of the new holding company. The original Northrop Grumman Corporation then changed its name to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation; the holding company, NNG, Inc., changed its name to Northrop Grumman Corporation.</p>
<p>Later that year, <a href="Northrop_Grumman_Newport_News" title="wikilink">Newport News Shipbuilding</a> was added to the company. And in 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired <a href="TRW" class="uri" title="wikilink">TRW</a>, which became the Space Technology sector based in Redondo Beach, CA, and the Mission Systems sector based in Reston, VA, with sole interest in their space systems and laser systems manufacturing. The Aeronautical division was sold to <a href="Goodrich_Corporation" title="wikilink">Goodrich</a>, and the automotive divisions were spun off and retained the TRW name.</p>
<p>There have been many other smaller acquisitions throughout this period.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> On July 20, 2007, Northrop Grumman became the sole owner of <a href="Burt_Rutan" title="wikilink">Burt Rutan's</a> <a href="Scaled_Composites" title="wikilink">Scaled Composites</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

Northrop Grumman announced formation of a new business unit (sector), effective January 1, 2006 called Technical Services.</p>
<p>In 2007 Northrop Grumman created the National Workforce Centers. The National Workforce centers are an alternative to <a href="Offshoring" class="uri" title="wikilink">Offshoring</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Current locations are Auburn, AL; Corsicana, TX; Fairmont, WV; Helena, MT; Johnstown, PA; Lebanon, VA; and Rapid City, SD.</p>

<p>In 2003, the company was among 84 parties with which the <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, and the state of <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> reached an estimated US$ 15 million settlement for the rehabilitation of the Mattiace Petrochemical Company Superfund site in <a href="Glen_Cove" title="wikilink">Glen Cove</a>, <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the same year, Northrop Grumman agreed to pay $33,214 after EPA inspectors found <a href="hazardous_waste" title="wikilink">hazardous waste</a> violations at the Capistrano test site.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>As a response to many of the previous claims, the company has stood up an organization for social responsibility. Among the recent projects is the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory Project. To reduce the carbon footprint created by Northrop Grumman operations, and in anticipation of upcoming new regulations, the EHS Leadership Council championed an initiative in 2008 to develop a way to accurately quantify companywide greenhouse gas emissions, and address the issue responsibly.</p>
<p>In 2008, Northrop Grumman launched its Environmental Sustainability program, which aims to advance Northrop Grumman&lt;U+2019&gt;s commitment to environmental performance both internally and externally. Here are some 2008 highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicated Earth Day statements from Ron Sugar and Wes Bush.</li>
<li>Published new internal and external web pages on environmental performance.</li>
<li>Established a foundation partnership with Earthwatch Institute to develop an innovative environmental education program. Teachers across the country will get the chance to participate in an Earthwatch expedition focused on climate change and ocean preservation, an invaluable transfer experience between the real world and classroom.</li>
<li>Developed a greenhouse gas strategy/plan.</li>
<li>Defined system requirements and developed a repeatable process for greenhouse gas data.</li>
<li>Collected an initial estimate of greenhouse gas emissions and water-use data.</li>
<li>Established a web-based data collection tool to collect annual data on water use and solid waste generation and recycling.</li>
<li>Switching lightbulb manufacturers&lt;U+2014&gt;choosing greener alternatives to achieve energy savings, labor savings and procurement savings (bulbs last longer, so need less frequent replacement).</li>
<li>Instituted furniture and carpet recycling at several Northrop Grumman facilities.</li>
<li>Implemented a new requirement that janitorial service providers to Northrop Grumman use only &lt;U+201C&gt;Green Seal Certified&lt;U+201D&gt; chemicals.</li>
<li>Deploying Managed Print Solution across the company, which to date has eliminated almost 2,000 devices resulting in a 25 percent reduction in energy consumption and solid waste and a 20 percent reduction in paper use. By the end of 2009 its anticipated implementation was to include more than 50 percent of Northrop Grumman sites.</li>
<li>Achieved &lt;U+201C&gt;SmartWay&lt;U+201D&gt; certification as a freight shipper. Through such &lt;U+201C&gt;load consolidation&lt;U+201D&gt; programs, the company is targeting a reduction of more than 1 million freight miles in 2009 and an additional half million miles in 2010. A high percentage of Northrop Grumman freight travels via companies that meet the rigorous standards set to become SmartWay Certified.</li>
<li>Developing an ECO Model to help evaluate and prioritize candidate Environmental Sustainability projects using a combination of traditional financial measures and green criteria.</li>
<li>Established a companywide Energy Conservation Task Force.</li>
<li>Environmental Sustainabiliy teams are increasing employee involvement by bringing people together to identify and implement projects to improve the environment at work. And as a bonus, many employees are taking these lessons home. One such team, some 100 highly engaged participants at the Northrop Grumman site in El Segundo, California, has established a website to support the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s activities and interests, including its first project: expanding site-wide collection of paper for recycling. The team is now establishing a process to expand the collection of recyclable bottles and cans. The team also provides volunteers for various community events and supports company events such as e-waste roundups. In 2009, the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s attention focused on energy efficiency projects and engaging 58 employees to help conserve energy.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>

<h3 id="political-contributions-and-governmental-ties">Political contributions and governmental ties</h3>
<p>From 1990-2002, Northrop Grumman contributed $8.5 million to federal campaigns.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> According to <a href="Political_action_committee" title="wikilink">PAC</a> summary data compiled by <a href="Source_Watch" title="wikilink">Source Watch</a>, the company gave US$1,011,260 to federal candidates in 2005-2006 election cycle, compared to $10,612,837 given by all defense contractors in the same cycle.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This donation amount was only behind that of General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin in the defense industry. The majority of the contributions, 63%, went to Republicans.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Former Northrop Grumman Electronics Systems chief <a href="James_G._Roche" title="wikilink">James G. Roche</a> served for two years as Secretary of the Air Force for George W. Bush. As reported by the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, Roche would eventually be nominated to head the Army, but would be forced to withdraw his nomination among accusations of mismanaging a contract with <a href="Boeing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boeing</a> and of failing to properly handle the Air Force sexual assault scandals of 2003.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> According to <a href="CorpWatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">CorpWatch</a>, &quot;at least seven former officials, consultants, or shareholders of Northrop Grumman&quot; have held posts &quot;in the Bush administration...including Deputy Secretary of Defense <a href="Paul_Wolfowitz" title="wikilink">Paul Wolfowitz</a>, Vice-Presidential Chief of Staff I. <a href="Lewis_Libby" title="wikilink">Lewis Libby</a>, Pentagon Comptroller Dov Zakheim, and Sean O&lt;U+2019&gt;Keefe, director of NASA.&quot; Wolfowitz and Libby have both since left the government amid scandals.</p>
<h3 id="scandals">Scandals</h3>
<p>Northrop Grumman has had to deal with multiple scandals during its history. The company was sued in 1999 for allegedly knowingly giving the Navy defective aircraft. This suit seeks $210 million in damages and is ongoing.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Then in 2003, the company was sued for allegedly overcharging the U.S. government for space projects in the 1990s. Northrop Grumman paid $111.2 million to settle that suit out of court.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1995, Robert Ferro, an employee for <a href="TRW" class="uri" title="wikilink">TRW</a>, a company acquired by Northrop Grumman, discovered that satellite components manufactured for the United States Air Force (USAF) were faulty and likely to fail in operation. TRW allegedly suppressed Ferro's report of the problem and hid the information from the USAF, even after a satellite in space equipped with the faulty components experienced serious anomalies. Ferro later sued Northrop Grumman in federal court under the federal whistle-blower law. On April 2, 2009 Northrop Grumman agreed to pay $325 million to settle the suit. Ferro was awarded $48.8 million of the settlement. Northrop Grumman stated about the settlement that, &quot;it believed that TRW had 'acted properly under its contracts' and that the company had substantive defenses against the claims.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>From August 25 through September 2, 2010, <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>'s computer operations experienced a week-long computer outage. Northrop Grumman operated these systems under a $2.4 billion contract. As a result, as many as 45,000 citizens could not renew their drivers licenses prior to their expiration. Computer systems for 26 of the state's 89 agencies were affected and Governor <a href="Bob_McDonnell" title="wikilink">Bob McDonnell</a> announced that some data may be permanently lost.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Northrop Grumman has apologized for the outage and will fund an investigation.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Northrop Grumman had contributed approximately $75,000 to McDonnell's campaign.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="international-traffic-in-arms-regulations-itar-violations">International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) Violations</h3>
<p>U.S. State Department investigators found that <a href="Litton_Industries" title="wikilink">Litton Industries</a>, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, provided portions of the computer source code of <a href="Air_Force_One" title="wikilink">Air Force One</a> to a company in Russia in 1998. Northrop Grumman agreed to pay a $15 million fine for 110 violations, occurring between September 1998 and November 1998, of the <a href="Arms_Export_Control_Act" title="wikilink">Arms Export Control Act</a> and the <a href="International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations" title="wikilink">International Traffic in Arms Regulations</a> (ITAR). The ITAR violations centered around guidance and navigation system interface information unique to Air Force One.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, documents filed by the State Department state that between 1994 and 2003, Northrop Grumman failed to notify the U.S. State Department about the computer guidance systems also being transferred to Angola, Indonesia, Israel, China, Ukraine and Yemen.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
