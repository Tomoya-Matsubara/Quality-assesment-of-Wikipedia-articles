<p><strong><em>Symphonic Fantasies: Music from Square Enix</em></strong> was an award winning symphonic tribute concert held in Cologne, Germany on the September 12, 2009 featuring <a href="video_game_music" title="wikilink">video game music</a> from Japanese game developer <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a>. The concert featured symphonic movements based on the <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series, <em><a href="Secret_of_Mana" title="wikilink">Secret of Mana</a></em>, the <em><a href="Chrono_(series)" title="wikilink">Chrono</a></em> series, and the <em><a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy</a></em> series. The concert was produced and directed by <a href="Thomas_B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker" title="wikilink">Thomas B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker</a>, with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician <a href="Jonne_Valtonen" title="wikilink">Jonne Valtonen</a> with assistance by Roger Wanamo. Due to overwhelming demand, a second concert was necessitated at the K&lt;U+00F6&gt;nig-Pilsener-Arena in <a href="Oberhausen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oberhausen</a>, on September 11, 2009. The concert was performed by The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the WDR Radio Choir Cologne under conduction from Arnie Roth, with guest performers <a href="Rony_Barrak" title="wikilink">Rony Barrak</a> and <a href="Benyamin_Nuss" title="wikilink">Benyamin Nuss</a> joining the orchestra. <em>Symphonic Fantasies</em> was broadcasted over radio on the WDR4 station and streamed live video online.</p>
<p>In 2012, 4 new performances were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.</p>

<p><a href="Thomas_B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker" title="wikilink">Thomas B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker</a> and then <a href="WDR_Symphony_Orchestra_Cologne" title="wikilink">WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne</a> director Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007, after Fechner had attended the <em><a href="Symphonic_Game_Music_Concerts" title="wikilink">Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert</a></em> held in Leipzig.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As their ideas and plans materialized, three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a new source of compositions. The first project was <em>PROMS: That's Sound, That's Rhythm</em>, held in early 2008, featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music, ranging from works by <a href="Ralph_Vaughan_Williams" title="wikilink">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="Morton_Gould" title="wikilink">Morton Gould</a> as well as arrangements of music from video games such as <em><a href="Shenmue" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenmue</a></em> and <em><a href="Castlevania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Castlevania</a></em> previously featured in the <em>Symphonic Game Music Concerts</em>. The second project, held in August 2008, was a composer specific concert titled <em><a href="Symphonic_Shades_-_H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck_in_Concert" title="wikilink">Symphonic Shades - H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck in Concert</a></em>, focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer <a href="Chris_H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck" title="wikilink">Chris H&lt;U+00FC&gt;lsbeck</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the concert, Fechner revealed in an interview the existance of the third project, saying that he and B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company, focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This company was later confirmed to be <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a> when Fechner announced <em>Symphonic Fantasies</em> as a video game music concert to take place on September 12, 2009. A website was set up for announcements, interviews and other concert information.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> and <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts_II" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> from the <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series, <em><a href="Secret_of_Mana" title="wikilink">Secret of Mana</a></em>, <em><a href="Chrono_Trigger" title="wikilink">Chrono Trigger</a></em> and <em><a href="Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink">Chrono Cross</a></em> from the <em><a href="Chrono_(series)" title="wikilink">Chrono</a></em> series, and the <em><a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy</a></em> series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The composers were <a href="Yoko_Shimomura" title="wikilink">Yoko Shimomura</a> for the <a href="music_of_Kingdom_Hearts" title="wikilink">music of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em></a>, <a href="Hiroki_Kikuta" title="wikilink">Hiroki Kikuta</a> for the <a href="music_of_the_Mana_series" title="wikilink">music of <em>Secret of Mana</em></a>, <a href="Yasunori_Mitsuda" title="wikilink">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> for the <a href="music_of_Chrono_Trigger" title="wikilink">music of <em>Chrono Trigger</em></a> and <a href="music_of_Chrono_Cross" title="wikilink"><em>Cross</em></a>, and <a href="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="wikilink">Nobuo Uematsu</a> for the <a href="music_of_the_Final_Fantasy_series" title="wikilink">music of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Jonne_Valtonen_Official.jpg" title="fig:Arranger Jonne Valtonen in 2010" alt="Arranger Jonne Valtonen in 2010" width="150" /> For the concert, <a href="Jonne_Valtonen" title="wikilink">Jonne Valtonen</a> returned as the lead arranger; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005, including <em>Symphonic Shades</em>. He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline given to him by B&lt;U+00F6&gt;cker. Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements, during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer's original intended expression.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material, but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on the arrangement of the music from the <em>Chrono</em> games.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This was Wanamo's first time arranging video game music.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> On March 9, 2009 It was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played at the start of the concert, and with a video preview of his composition was released.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The arrangements in the concert were structured as suites, dubbed &quot;Fantasies&quot;, with multiple songs from each game series positioned and arranged together to tell melodic stories rather than using the conventional medley structure more commonly heard in video game music arrangements.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The fanfare, titled <em>Fanfare Overture</em>, was done in a style of traditional fanfares with some accentuated textures in order to introduce all the elements of the orchestra. The <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> suite featured seven songs from the two titles, and was arranged as a romantic piano concerto.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <em>Secret of Mana</em> featured six songs featured in the original game.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The arrangement made use of notable unique techniques in order to replicate the atmosphere found in the original game; for example, the choir was used to create &quot;sound effects&quot; such as floor vibration by foot stomping and simulating distant rain with their voices.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The <em>Chrono</em> suite featured ten songs from <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Chrono Cross</em>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The suite featured a &quot;crossing&quot; of melodies, in which multiple melodies would be layered on top of one another, resulting in different well-known themes performed simultaneously in harmony.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The <em>Final Fantasy</em> suite contained eight songs from the first seven titles in the series. Unlike the other suites, it featured a simpler structure, focusing more on each individual theme rather than overlapping multiple pieces.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The initial event received widespread critical acclaim, with much praise given to the focused presentation, deeply developed arrangements and evolution of the concept. Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version stated that the concert &quot;exceeded all expectations&quot; and further added that the event was &quot;absolutely amazing&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online concluded in his report that &quot;<em>Symphonic Fantasies</em> ranks among the greatest musical and social experiences of my life. Each arrangement took listeners on an extended journey through the atmospheres, emotions, and melodies of their respective series.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Polish site GameMusic.net's Kamil Rojek said in his report that &quot;<em>Symphonic Fantasies</em> is a significant turning point in the history of video game music concerts. It was a remarkable event that made great progress in breaking the boundaries between game music and traditional classical works.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The composers themselves expressed great regard for the concert and the arrangement. Yoko Shimomura noted she was extremely pleased with Valtonen's arrangement of Kingdom Hearts, feeling it &quot;very colorful and beautiful, just superb really&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Hiroki Kikuta stated that Valtonen's arrangement &quot;defied the framework of regular orchestra and was a very experimental attempt,&quot; resulting in &quot;free and unbound expression&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Yasunori Mitsuda expressed that he was &quot;really amazed by its fantastic quality&quot;,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and Nobuo Uematsu said that it was &quot;an exceptionally well-produced concert compared to most game concerts.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The composers also voiced their desire to bring the concert to Japan.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Symphonic Fantasies</em> album garnered universal praise upon its release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan said of the album &quot;this is the best game music arranged album of 2010.
