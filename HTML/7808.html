<p>In Black's nearly 20 years on the Coke board and on &quot;a company committee that focused on policy issues including <a href="Soft_drink#Obesity_and_weight_related_diseases" title="wikilink">obesity and selling soda to children</a>,&quot; Bloomberg and others opposed the company and other manufacturers' sales efforts in schools. Black resigned her position on the Coke board after the NYC nomination, citing potential conflicts of interest. She was paid over $2 million in cash and stock over her tenure on the board, and still owns over $3 million worth of company stock. The mayor reiterated both the school policy against soda sales and his support for Black when the subject was raised after the nomination. <a href="Donald_McHenry" title="wikilink">Donald McHenry</a>, &quot;a longtime Coke board member and a professor at <a href="Georgetown_University" title="wikilink">Georgetown University</a> who sat on the committee&quot; with Black, confirmed that the issue had faced the board continuously but did not address Black's position or individual role in the internal company debates, decisions and actions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

She resigned, after much controversy, on April 7, 2011.</p>
<h3 id="controversy">Controversy</h3>
<p>Having neither three years of teaching experience nor a master's degree nor a professional degree in educational management, Black required a waiver from the <a href="New_York_State_Education_Department" title="wikilink">New York State Education Department</a> under <a href="Commissioner_of_Education_of_the_State_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Education Commissioner</a> <a href="David_M._Steiner" title="wikilink">David M. Steiner</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The waiver was granted by Steiner, with Black's shortfall in formal qualifications &quot;offset by the appointment of a chief academic officer to serve by her side [as well as her] 'exceptional record of successfully leading complex organizations and achievement of excellence in her endeavors.'&quot; Black appointed <a href="Shael_Polakow-Suransky" title="wikilink">Shael Polakow-Suransky</a> to the academic-officer role, and assumed her post January 1, 2011.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Steiner announced his own resignation the very same afternoon, but did not disclose any reason.

<p>After taking office, Black upset parents on January 14, 2011, when responding to a question from a parent about overcrowded classrooms in New York City by jokingly suggesting that the solution to future overcrowding may be <a href="birth_control" title="wikilink">birth control</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Black also said at the same meeting that making decisions about satisfying classroom space concerns is like making &quot;many <a href="Sophie&#39;s_Choice_(novel)" title="wikilink">Sophie's Choices</a>&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; a reference to a novel in which a mother is forced to choose which of her children is killed at <a href="Auschwitz_concentration_camp" title="wikilink">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A spokesman for the Department of Education later said Black cares about overcrowding, and &quot;regrets if she left a different impression by making an off-handed joke in the course of that conversation.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>As Schools Chancellor, Black presided over meetings on February 1 and February 3, 2011, to close 22 schools that the City classified as failing. Towards the end of the meeting on February 1, Black spoke to the crowd of parents. At that meeting Black told the crowd &quot;I can't speak if you're shouting,&quot; and after the crowd continued to boo Black, she responded by imitating the crowd's jeers in a &quot;mocking&quot; fashion.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> As a result, at the following meeting on February 3, Black was booed by parents and criticized by members of the <a href="New_York_City_Council" title="wikilink">New York City Council</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
