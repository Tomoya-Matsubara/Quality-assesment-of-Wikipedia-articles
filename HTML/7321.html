<p><strong>Pericles</strong> or <strong>Perikles</strong> (ca. <a href="495_BC" title="wikilink">495</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="429_BC" title="wikilink">429 BC</a>, <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: , meaning &quot;surrounded by glory&quot;) was a prominent and influential <a href="statesman" class="uri" title="wikilink">statesman</a>, orator, and general of <a href="History_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Athens</a> in the city's <a href="Golden_Age" title="wikilink">Golden Age</a> (specifically, between the <a href="Greco-Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Persian</a> and <a href="Peloponnesian_War" title="wikilink">Peloponnesian</a> wars). He was descended, through his mother, from the <a href="Alcmaeonidae" title="wikilink">Alcmaeonid</a> family.</p>
<p>Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that <a href="Thucydides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thucydides</a>, his contemporary historian, acclaimed him as &quot;the first citizen of Athens&quot;. Pericles turned the <a href="Delian_League" title="wikilink">Delian League</a> into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from <a href="461_BC" title="wikilink">461 BC</a> to <a href="429_BC" title="wikilink">429 BC</a>, is sometimes known as the &quot;<a href="Age_of_Pericles" title="wikilink">Age of Pericles</a>,&quot; though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the <a href="Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Persian Wars</a>, or as late as the next century.</p>
<p>Pericles promoted the arts and literature; this was a chief reason Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural centre of the <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a> world. He started an ambitious project that built most of the surviving structures on the <a href="Acropolis,_Athens" title="wikilink">Acropolis</a> (including the <a href="Parthenon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthenon</a>). This project beautified the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, Pericles fostered <a href="Athenian_democracy" title="wikilink">Athenian democracy</a> to such an extent that critics call him a <a href="populism" title="wikilink">populist</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Pericles was born at about <a href="495_BC" title="wikilink">495 BC</a>, in the <a href="deme" class="uri" title="wikilink">deme</a> of <a href="Cholargos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cholargos</a> just north of <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. He was the son of the politician <a href="Xanthippus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xanthippus</a>, who, although <a href="ostracism" title="wikilink">ostracized</a> in 485&lt;U+2013&gt;4 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at <a href="Battle_of_Mycale" title="wikilink">Mycale</a> just five years later. Pericles' mother, <a href="Agariste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agariste</a>, was a scion of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections played a crucial role in starting Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of <a href="Sicyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicyon</a>, <a href="Cleisthenes_of_Sicyon" title="wikilink">Cleisthenes</a>, and the niece of the Supreme Athenian reformer <a href="Cleisthenes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleisthenes</a>, another Alcmaeonid.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> According to <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a>, Agariste dreamed, a few nights before Pericles' birth, that she had borne a lion.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> One interpretation of the anecdote treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusual size of Pericles' skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> (Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as <a href="strategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategos</a> (general)).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Around <a href="462_BC" title="wikilink">462 BC</a>-<a href="461_BC" title="wikilink">461 BC</a> the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the <a href="Areopagus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Areopagus</a>, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, <a href="Ephialtes_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Ephialtes</a>, proposed a sharp reduction of the Areopagus&lt;U+2019&gt; powers.

<p>Such measures impelled Pericles' critics to regard him as responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. <a href="Constantine_Paparregopoulus" title="wikilink">Constantine Paparrigopoulos</a>, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Hence, he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred on account of limited means or humble birth.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> According to Samons, Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the demos, in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> (The fleet, backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles, was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Cimon, on the other hand, apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles&lt;U+2019&gt; reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy.

Nonetheless, the &quot;serious purpose&quot; (namely the bribery) was so obvious to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> After the Spartan threat had been removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea to crush the revolt there.

<h4 id="final-battle-with-the-conservatives">Final battle with the conservatives</h4>
<p>In <a href="444_BC" title="wikilink">444 BC</a>, the conservative and the democratic faction confronted each other in a fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of the conservatives, <a href="Thucydides_(politician)" title="wikilink">Thucydides</a> (not to be confused with the historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides managed, initially, to incite the passions of the ecclesia in his favor, but, when Pericles, the leader of the democrats, took the floor, he put the conservatives in the shade. Pericles responded resolutely, proposing to reimburse the city for all the expenses from his private property, under the term that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides suffered an unexpected defeat.

<p>Pericles wanted to stabilize Athens' dominance over its alliance and to enforce its pre-eminence in Greece. The process by which the Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by measures implemented by Pericles.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The final steps in the shift to empire may have been triggered by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean and led to the revolt of several allies, such as <a href="Miletus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miletus</a> and <a href="Erythrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erythrae</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from <a href="Delos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delos</a> to Athens in 454&lt;U+2013&gt;453 BC.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> By 450&lt;U+2013&gt;449 BC the revolts in Miletus and Erythrae were quelled and Athens restored its rule over its allies.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Around 447 BC Clearchus proposed the Coinage Decree, which imposed Athenian silver coinage, weights and measures on all of the allies.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> According to one of the decree's most stringent provisions, surplus from a minting operation was to go into a special fund, and anyone proposing to use it otherwise was subject to the death penalty.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack, as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian war, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, <a href="Aspasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aspasia</a>, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.</p>
<p>Phidias, who had been in charge of all building projects, was first accused of embezzling gold intended for the statue of <a href="Athena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athena</a> and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the <a href="Amazons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amazons</a> on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Pericles' enemies also found a false witness against Phidias, named Menon.</p>
<p>Aspasia, who was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles' perversions.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Aspasia was probably a <a href="hetaera" class="uri" title="wikilink">hetaera</a> and ran a <a href="brothel" class="uri" title="wikilink">brothel</a>,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> although these allegations are disputed by modern scholars.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The accusations against her were probably nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles.

<p>Beyond these initial prosecutions, the ecclesia attacked Pericles himself by asking him to justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did not let the Athenians yield to the <a href="Lacedaemonians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lacedaemonians</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Thus, at the start of the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose preeminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="peloponnesian-war">Peloponnesian War</h2>

<p>The causes of the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but most ancient historians laid the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics &quot;with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife&quot;. Thucydides hints at the same thing; although he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has, at this point, been criticised for bias towards <a href="Sparta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sparta</a>.</p>

<p>Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta, which could not conceal its envy of Athens' pre-eminence, was inevitable if not to be welcomed.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Therefore he did not hesitate to send troops to <a href="Corcyra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corcyra</a> to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, which was fighting against <a href="Corinth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corinth</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In <a href="433_BC" title="wikilink">433 BC</a> the enemy fleets confronted each other at the <a href="Battle_of_Sybota" title="wikilink">Battle of Sybota</a> and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the <a href="Battle_of_Potidaea" title="wikilink">Battle of Potidaea</a>; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth's lasting hatred of Athens. During the same period, Pericles proposed the <a href="Megarian_decree" title="wikilink">Megarian Decree</a>, which resembled a modern trade embargo. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which was allied with Megara. According to George Cawkwell, a <a href="praelector" class="uri" title="wikilink">praelector</a> in <a href="ancient_history" title="wikilink">ancient history</a>, with this decree Pericles breached the Thirty Years Peace &quot;but, perhaps, not without the semblance of an excuse&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The Athenians' justification was that the Megarians had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to <a href="Demeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demeter</a> and had given refuge to runaway slaves, a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>After consultations with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles' instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents' demands, since they were militarily stronger.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions, believing that &quot;if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a <em>quid pro quo</em>. In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory (<a href="xenelasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">xenelasia</a>) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta's hegemony was also ruthless.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and, with neither side willing to back down, the two sides prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and <a href="international_politics" title="wikilink">international politics</a>, &quot;rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles' stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed herself weak.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded <a href="Attica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Attica</a>, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas.

This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, might pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>In any case, seeing the pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even in the face of mounting pressure, Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the &quot;prytanies&quot;, Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the <a href="Peloponnese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peloponnese</a> and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces.

In any case, the city's plight, caused by the epidemic, triggered a new wave of public uproar, and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech, a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> This is considered to be a monumental oration, revealing Pericles' virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots' ingratitude.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Temporarily, he managed to tame the people's resentment and to ride out the storm, but his internal enemies' final bid to undermine him came off; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Ancient sources mention <a href="Cleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleon</a>, a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war, as the public prosecutor in Pericles' trial.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians not only forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos.

His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the disease in the autumn of <a href="429_BC" title="wikilink">429 BC</a>.</p>
<p>Just before his death, Pericles' friends were concentrated around his bed, enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies. Pericles, though moribund, heard them and interrupted them, pointing out that they forgot to mention his fairest and greatest title to their admiration; &quot;for&quot;, said he, &quot;no living Athenian ever put on mourning because of me&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Pericles lived during the first two and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and, according to Thucydides, his death was a disaster for Athens, since his successors were inferior to him; they preferred to incite all the bad habits of the rabble and followed an unstable policy, endeavoring to be popular rather than useful.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> With these bitter comments, Thucydides not only laments the loss of a man he admired, but he also heralds the flickering of Athens' unique glory and grandeur.</p>

This marriage, however, was not a happy one, and at some point near 445 BC, Pericles divorced his wife and offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p>The woman he really adored was <a href="Aspasia_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Aspasia of Miletus</a>. She became Pericles' mistress and they began to live together as if they were married. This relationship aroused many reactions and even Pericles' own son, Xanthippus, who had political ambitions, did not hesitate to slander his father.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Nonetheless, these persecutions did not undermine Pericles' morale, although he had to burst into tears in order to protect his beloved Aspasia when she was accused of corrupting Athenian society. His greatest personal tragedy was the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Xanthippus and Paralus, all affected by the epidemic, a calamity he never managed to overcome. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the younger, a citizen and legitimate heir,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> a decision all the more striking in consideration that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="assessments">Assessments</h2>
<p>Pericles marked a whole era and inspired conflicting judgments about his significant decisions, which is something normal for a political personality of his magnitude. The fact that he was at the same time a vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.</p>

<p>Some contemporary scholars, for example Sarah Ruden, call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming the leadership of Athens, &quot;he was no longer the same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes&quot;.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians, since &quot;he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making&quot;.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Thucydides, an admirer of Pericles, maintains that Athens was &quot;in name a democracy but, in fact, governed by its first citizen&quot;.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Through this comment, the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles' charisma to lead, convince and, sometimes, to manipulate. Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles, he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles' integrity.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> On the other hand, in one of his dialogues, <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a> rejects the glorification of Pericles and quotes <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a> as saying: &quot;As far as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles' leadership: &quot;many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing&quot;.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>Thucydides argues that Pericles &quot;was not carried away by the people, but he was the one guiding the people&quot;.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> His judgement is not unquestioned; some 20th century critics, such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or the people themselves.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader.

<h3 id="military-achievements">Military achievements</h3>
<p>For more than 20 years Pericles led numerous expeditions, mainly naval ones. Being always cautious, he never undertook of his own accord a battle involving much uncertainty and peril and he did not accede to the &quot;vain impulses of the citizens&quot;.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> He based his military policy on <a href="Themistocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Themistocles</a>' principle that Athens' predominance depends on its superior naval power and believed that the Peloponnesians were near-invincible on land.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Pericles tried also to minimize the advantages of Sparta by rebuilding the walls of Athens. According to Josiah Ober, professor of classics in <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>, the strategy of rebuilding the walls radically altered the use of force in Greek international relations.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<p>During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles initiated a defensive &quot;grand strategy&quot; whose aim was the exhaustion of the enemy and the preservation of the <em>status quo</em>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> According to Platias and Koliopoulos, Athens as the strongest party did not have to beat Sparta in military terms and &quot;chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The two basic principles of the &quot;Periclean Grand Strategy&quot; were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension. According to Kagan, Pericles' vehement insistence that there should be no diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign, which he had allegedly supported.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> His strategy is said to have been &quot;inherently unpopular&quot;, but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> It is for that reason that <a href="Hans_Delbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;ck" title="wikilink">Hans Delbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;ck</a> called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> For his part, Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics of Pericles' strategy, however, have been just as numerous as its supporters. A common criticism is that Pericles was always a better politician and orator than strategist.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> <a href="Donald_Kagan" title="wikilink">Donald Kagan</a> called the Periclean strategy &quot;a form of wishful thinking that failed&quot;, and Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that &quot;as strategist he was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens' great defeat&quot;.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts: first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war; second, that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility; third, that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities; and fourth, that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Kagan estimates Pericles' expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2,000 <a href="Talent_(weight)" title="wikilink">talents</a> annually, and based on this figure concludes that he would only have enough money to keep the war going for three years. He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Others, such as Donald W. Knight, conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Platias and Koliopoulos reject these criticisms and state that &quot;the Athenians lost the war only when they dramatically reversed the Periclean grand strategy that explicitly disdained further conquests&quot;.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> It is a popular conclusion that those succeeding him lacked his abilities and character.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Illus0362.jpg" title="fig:Painting of Hector Leroux (1682&lt;U+2013&gt;1740), which portrays Pericles and Aspasia, admiring the gigantic statue of Athena in Phidias&#39; studio." alt="Painting of Hector Leroux (1682&lt;U+2013&gt;1740), which portrays Pericles and Aspasia, admiring the gigantic statue of Athena in Phidias&#39; studio." /> Thucydides' modern commentators are still trying to unravel the puzzle of Pericles' orations and to figure out if the wording belongs to the Athenian statesman or the historian. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts. Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.</p>
<p>Kagan states that Pericles adopted &quot;an elevated mode of speech, free from the vulgar and knavish tricks of mob-orators&quot; and, according to <a href="Diodorus_Siculus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Siculus</a>, he &quot;excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory&quot;.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> According to <a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a>, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate <a href="Demosthenes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demosthenes</a>, and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> The biographer points out, however, that the poet <a href="Ion_of_Chios" title="wikilink">Ion</a> reported that Pericles' speaking style was &quot;a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> <a href="Gorgias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gorgias</a>, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> In <a href="Menexenus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menexenus</a>, however, Socrates casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by <a href="Antiphon_(person)" title="wikilink">Antiphon</a>.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>Ancient Greek writers call Pericles &quot;Olympian&quot; and vaunt his talents; referring to him &quot;thundering and lightening and exciting Greece&quot; and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> According to <a href="Quintilian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quintilian</a>, Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and, before going on the rostrum, he would always pray to the Gods, so as not to utter any improper word.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> <a href="Richard_Claverhouse_Jebb" title="wikilink">Sir Richard C. Jebb</a> concludes that &quot;unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians&quot;.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>
<p>Pericles' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of his Golden Age, most of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are &quot;sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world&quot;.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>In politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles' legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Nonetheless, other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Pericles is lauded as &quot;the <a href="ideal_type" title="wikilink">ideal type</a> of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece&quot; and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
