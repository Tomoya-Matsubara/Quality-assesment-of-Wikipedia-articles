<p><img src="Parksafb-5oct1954.jpg" title="fig:Parks AFB, CA - 5 Oct 1954" alt="Parks AFB, CA - 5 Oct 1954" width="300" /> <strong>Parks Reserve Forces Training Area (PRFTA)</strong> is a former <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> Base located near <a href="Oakland,_California" title="wikilink">Oakland, California</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The facility was built during World War II, and was commissioned <a href="19_January" title="wikilink">19 January</a> <a href="1943" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943</a> as <strong>Camp Parks</strong> and was home to the <a href="Seabee" title="wikilink">Navy Seabees</a>. It was named after Rear Admiral Charles W. Parks, CEC, USN.</p>
<p>Adjacent to Camp Parks to the east, was <strong>Camp Shoemaker</strong> and the <strong>U.S. Naval Hospital Shoemaker</strong>, also built during the war. The three Navy bases laying side by side were called &quot;Fleet City.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1945, on its huge paved parade ground, Camp Parks could muster more than 20,000 men and hundreds of officers. It was the home for Seabee battalions returning from the Pacific Theater of Operations after a year or more of arduous construction duty. They came to Camp Parks for medical treatment, military training and reorganization. The base housed up to 20 battalions at a time. Most battalions prepared for a second tour in the Pacific. Many Seabees were hospitalized, and those no longer fit for duty received their discharge. After their initial leaves, personnel were given rigorous training and battalions were brought back up to fighting strength.</p>
<p>In <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a>, at the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the <a href="Secretary_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Navy</a> disestablished the three facilities, and from <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a> to <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, the Navy leased the land to the County of <a href="Alameda_County,_California" title="wikilink">Alameda</a> for use as a rehabilitation center. The sea of Quonset huts and Itwo-story wooden barracks were dismantled in the following years.</p>
<p>Camp Parks sat unused until the Air Force established a basic training center in <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, during the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>, and renamed the facility <strong>Parks Air Force Base</strong>, and made it a Basic Military Training Center. The Air Force had to completely rebuild the base. Base personnel were initially housed in temporary facilities and ate from a field mess. The first group of Airmen arrived at Camp Parks in the Summer of 1951; mass training began in March 1952.</p>
<p>In July <a href="1959" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959</a>, the installation was transferred to the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">United States Army</a>. From <a href="1959" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959</a> to <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a>, it was operated in a standby status under the jurisdiction of the <a href="U.S._Sixth_Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Sixth Army</a>, <a href="Presidio_of_San_Francisco" title="wikilink">Presidio</a> of <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a>, the U.S. Army determined that Camp Parks was needed as a mobilization and training center for Reserve Components in the event of war or natural disaster. On <a href="December_11" title="wikilink">December 11</a>, <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>, the Army officially designated Camp Parks as a semi-active installation, renamed it <strong>Parks Reserve Forces Training Area</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, Parks is a direct-reporting installation of <a href="Fort_McCoy,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Fort McCoy</a>, <a href="Wisconsin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="current-mission">Current mission</h2>
<p>Parks has a primary mission of exercising the functions of command, training, security, administration, servicing and supply to all troop units, military activities and other governmental agencies assigned or attached.</p>
<p>New and state-of-the-art training facilities have been built and more are planned. In the garrison area are administrative and classroom buildings, upgraded housing, a remodeled dining facility, a modern lodging facility, an informative history center, and other support and training facilities.</p>
<p>Parks RFTA is the only local training facility for more than 11,000 Army Reserve Soldiers in the San Francisco Bay Area where firing ranges and a wide variety of training facilities are available.
