<p><a href="Dwight_Schrute" title="wikilink">Dwight</a> (<a href="Rainn_Wilson" title="wikilink">Rainn Wilson</a>), <a href="Jim_Halpert" title="wikilink">Jim</a> (<a href="John_Krasinski" title="wikilink">John Krasinski</a>), <a href="Stanley_Hudson" title="wikilink">Stanley</a> (<a href="Leslie_David_Baker" title="wikilink">Leslie David Baker</a>), <a href="Cathy_Simms" title="wikilink">Cathy</a> (Lindsey Broad), Ryan (<a href="B.J._Novak" title="wikilink">B.J. Novak</a>) and <a href="Erin_Hannon" title="wikilink">Erin</a> (<a href="Ellie_Kemper" title="wikilink">Ellie Kemper</a>) travel to Tallahassee as part of a <a href="Special_Project" title="wikilink">team picked for Sabre's new project</a>. On the day of orientation, Dwight wakes everyone up at 5 o'clock in order to be ready. Jim, however, being used to two babies, has been up since 4 and decorates his room to look as if he had been murdered in order to prank Dwight, going as far as to writing &quot;It was Dwight&quot; on the wall in faux-blood. Dwight and Erin then walk in the room only to find it in ruins. Moments later, Jim lurches out of the closet as if he has been murdered.</p>
<p>At the orientation meeting, Dwight and Jim soon discover that <a href="Todd_Packer" title="wikilink">Todd Packer</a> (<a href="David_Koechner" title="wikilink">David Koechner</a>) is still working at the company after <a href="Todd_Packer_(The_Office)" title="wikilink">the two of them attempted to get him fired</a>, which Packer has already realized. The president of Sabre's special projects, <a href="Nellie_Bertram" title="wikilink">Nellie Bertram</a> (<a href="Catherine_Tate" title="wikilink">Catherine Tate</a>) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival <a href="Apple_Inc." title="wikilink">Apple</a>'s chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. Dwight, however, develops an <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a> and is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is &quot;desire.&quot; Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day. Afterwards, <a href="Wally_Amos" title="wikilink">Wally Amos</a> of <a href="Famous_Amos" title="wikilink">Famous Amos</a> cookies (as himself) attempts to make a speech to the group, but is interrupted and ultimately eclipsed by the cookies he brought for the group.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Scranton, the office is left without a receptionist. <a href="Andy_Bernard" title="wikilink">Andy</a> (<a href="Ed_Helms" title="wikilink">Ed Helms</a>) decides to fill in and pretends to thoroughly enjoy himself. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. <a href="Pam_Halpert" title="wikilink">Pam</a> (<a href="Jenna_Fischer" title="wikilink">Jenna Fischer</a>) and <a href="Darryl_Philbin" title="wikilink">Darryl</a> (<a href="Craig_Robinson_(actor)" title="wikilink">Craig Robinson</a>) attempt to talk him out of his newfound &quot;enjoyment,&quot; believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.</p>

<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>
<p>&quot;Tallahassee&quot; received largely positive reviews from critics, with many noting that the Florida story-line gave the series a focus. <em>TV Equals</em> noted that the episode was &quot;one of the best episodes of <em>The Office</em> this the season and [possibly] one of the better episodes from the last couple of seasons.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that &quot;Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction -- and hope that maybe the series still has hope. [...] More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Bret Davinger from the <em>California Literary Review</em> noted that &quot;A couple of weeks ago, I complained about <em>The Office</em> spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Jeffrey Hyatt from <em>Screencrave</em> awarded the album an 8 out of 10 and wrote that &quot;between '<a href="Special_Project" title="wikilink">Special Project</a>' and 'Tallahassee' it&lt;U+2019&gt;s fair to say that <em>The Office</em> is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week&lt;U+2019&gt;s episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em>TV Fanatic</em> reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Despite praising the episode for coming &quot;together as one of the best <em>Office</em> episodes of the season,&quot; he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it &quot;not funny.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <em>The Filtered Lens</em> reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode &quot;solid&quot; and noted &quot;While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <em>What Culture!</em> reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, &lt;U+201C&gt;'Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [the] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been waiting for all season.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all reviews were positive. <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> reviewer Myles McNutt gave the episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He wrote that, &quot;I would argue, though, that [undeveloped characters are] part of the show&lt;U+2019&gt;s problem right now&quot; and noted that Tate's performance was expanded &quot;little [...] beyond her initial appearance last season.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In a review for the subsequent episode, &quot;<a href="After_Hours_(The_Office)" title="wikilink">After Hours</a>,&quot; however, McNutt acknowledged that, &quot;If I&lt;U+2019&gt;m being honest with [sic], last week&lt;U+2019&gt;s probably should have been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and have to stand by that decision.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
