<p>The <strong>Briarcliff Lodge</strong> was a luxury <a href="resort" class="uri" title="wikilink">resort</a> in the village of <a href="Briarcliff_Manor,_New_York" title="wikilink">Briarcliff Manor, New York</a>. It was a notable example of <a href="Tudor_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Tudor Revival architecture</a>, and was one of the largest wooden structures in the United States. It was also the first hotel in <a href="Westchester_County" title="wikilink">Westchester County</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Walter_William_Law" title="wikilink">Walter William Law</a> had it built on his estate, and the Law family owned it until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom and dining room. For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Greenhouses and Briarcliff Table Water Company.</p>
<p>In 1933, the lodge ended year-round service and housed a &quot;health-diet sanitarium&quot; until the Edgewood Park School for Girls began operation there from 1937 to 1954. From 1936 to 1939, the lodge was run again as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed. From 1955 to 1994, <a href="The_King&#39;s_College_(New_York)" title="wikilink">The King's College</a> used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings. Abandoned and unmaintained after 1994, the Briarcliff Lodge was destroyed between 2003 and 2004.</p>

<p><img src="Images_from_Our_Village,_Briarcliff_Manor_11.JPG" title="fig:The lodge before its 1907 and 1909 additions|alt=A large Tudor Revival resort" alt="The lodge before its 1907 and 1909 additions|alt=A large Tudor Revival resort" /> Walter Law hired <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> architect Guy King to construct the Briarcliff Lodge on the highest point of Law's estate. The building's first floor exterior walls were constructed of stones from nearby forests, and Indiana limestone was used for trimmings. the second floor exterior walls were decorated with half timber with <a href="pebbledash" class="uri" title="wikilink">pebbledash</a>. The roof had red shingles and red brick chimneys. At its June 26, 1902 opening, the <a href="Tudor_Revival" title="wikilink">Tudor Revival</a>-style building was a premier resort hotel with approximately 75 rooms. The main facade of the building was two stories high, while third and fourth floor dormer windows were present on the roof. The <a href="Olmsted_Brothers" title="wikilink">Olmsted Brothers</a>, sons of the eminent landscape designer <a href="Frederick_Law_Olmsted" title="wikilink">Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, designed the lodge's surrounding grounds. In 1903, the lodge additionally began being used by Mary Elizabeth Dow as Mrs. Dow's School. Walter Law gave Dow a  property on Elm Road (later the site of <a href="Briarcliff_College" title="wikilink">Briarcliff College</a> and then a <a href="Pace_University" title="wikilink">Pace University</a> campus).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>  In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw construction of a north wing, increasing the number of rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. The west wing had a <a href="mooring_mast" title="wikilink">mooring mast</a> intended for airships, although no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships. There were two sets of greenhouses on the property; one set behind Law's home produced decorations for Law's farm, house, the lodge, and workers' houses. The other set, the Pierson Greenhouses, were used for growing the <a href="American_Beauty_rose" title="wikilink">American Beauty rose</a> and rare <a href="carnation" title="wikilink">carnations</a>, producing between 5,000 and 8,000 per week. Foreman George Romaine first propagated the Briarcliff rose there. The lodge also ran an annual American Beauty carnival, with events including a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, cinema program, and a concert.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> During the lodge's service, carriage transportation was provided for guests from the Scarborough and Briarcliff Manor train stations to the lodge.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The lodge had a large Roman-style pool; when it was built in 1912, it was the largest outdoor pool in the world<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and was used for the <a href="1924_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1924 Olympic trials</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Briarcliff Lodge was noted for its cuisine (including Briarcliff dairy and table water), a golf course, fifteen tennis courts, a music room, theater, indoor swimming pool, casino, library, stable, repair shops and a fleet of Fiat automobiles.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The water tower at the property was constructed by the <a href="Chicago_Bridge_&amp;_Iron_Company" title="wikilink">Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company</a>. The grounds were decorated with Japanese lanterns that Law had obtained from missionaries. The lodge had elevator service and electric lighting.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <a href="Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace" title="wikilink">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a> held its National Conference on International Problems and Relations at the Briarcliff Lodge from May 10&lt;U+2013&gt;14, 1926.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <img src="Briarcliff_Lodge_Fire.jpg" title="fig:Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville Fire Departments fighting the lodge fire" alt="Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville Fire Departments fighting the lodge fire" /> In 1923, a year before Walter Law's death, the Law family leased the lodge to Chauncey Depew Steele for 20 years. Under Steele's management, the lodge reached its prominence. The lodge also was opened to a wider variety of clientele, but continued to be known as a resort for the wealthy and famous. A  18-hole golf course was completed in 1923, designed by <a href="Devereux_Emmet" title="wikilink">Devereux Emmet</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In May 1925, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> reported that the Briarcliff Lodge installed the first artificial spa; using radioactive mineral <a href="torbernite" class="uri" title="wikilink">torbernite</a> to affect the water, believed to counter ailments associated with old age. Unites States Senators <a href="Chauncey_Depew" title="wikilink">Chauncey Depew</a>, <a href="James_Wolcott_Wadsworth,_Jr." title="wikilink">James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Royal_S._Copeland" title="wikilink">Royal S.

Walter Law's son Henry (also village mayor from 1918 to 1938) attributed the decline to the 1920-1933 <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">prohibition</a> of alcohol. Another factor was the increasing usage of automobiles, as guests would be less inclined to stay throughout the summer. Steele ended up surrendering his lease in 1933;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> at the time the building was valued at $750,000 ($ today).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The lodge remained in use, housing a &quot;health-diet sanitarium&quot; until the Edgewood Park School for Girls, a nonsectarian Christian college- and occupational-preparatory school,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> leased the property in 1936, and purchased it a year later; at the time the lodge was valued at $1,000,000 ($ today).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The lodge was run as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed until 1939.

<p>In September 1955, <em>The New York Times</em> reported that the lodge was being reopened as a 225-room resort; after being purchased by a partnership led by Emanuel Shapiro, counsel for then-New York Governor <a href="Thomas_E._Dewey" title="wikilink">Thomas E.
