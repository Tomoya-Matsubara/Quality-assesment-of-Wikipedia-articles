<p>The <strong><a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> anti-war protest</strong> was a coordinated day of <a href="Protests_against_the_Iraq_War" title="wikilink">protests</a> across the world against the imminent <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">invasion of Iraq</a>. Millions of people <a href="protest" title="wikilink">protested</a> in approximately 800 cities around the world. According to <a href="BBC_News" title="wikilink">BBC News</a>, between six and ten million people took part in protests in up to sixty countries over the weekend of the 15th and 16th; other estimates range from eight million to thirty million.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The biggest protests took place in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. The protest in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> involved around 3 million people, and is listed in the <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> <em><a href="Guinness_Book_of_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness Book of World Records</a></em> as the largest anti-war <a href="Demonstration_(people)" title="wikilink">rally</a> in history.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Opposition to the war was highest in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>, although protests there were relatively small - <a href="Mainland_China" title="wikilink">Mainland China</a> was the only major region not to see any protests.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In 2002, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> government began to argue for the necessity of invading Iraq. This formally began with a speech by U.S President <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> to the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a> on <a href="September_12" title="wikilink">September 12</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> which argued that the <a href="Iraqi_government" title="wikilink">Iraqi government</a> of <a href="Saddam_Hussein" title="wikilink">Saddam Hussein</a> was violating U.N. resolutions, primarily on <a href="weapons_of_mass_destruction" title="wikilink">weapons of mass destruction</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The proposed war was controversial with many people questioning the motives of the U.S government and its rationale.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> One poll which covered 41 countries claimed that less than 10% would support an invasion of Iraq without UN sanction and that half would not support an invasion under any circumstances.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="List_of_anti-war_organizations" title="wikilink">Anti-war groups</a> across the world organised public protests. According to the <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> academic Dominique Reyni&lt;U+00E9&gt; between the 3rd of January and 12th of April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 anti-war protests, the demonstrations on <a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a> 2003 being the largest and most prolific.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The invasion of Iraq began on <a href="March_20" title="wikilink">March 20</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>.</p>
<h2 id="international-coordination">International coordination</h2>
<p>The <a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a> international protests were unprecedented not only in terms of the size of the demonstrations but also in terms of the international coordination involved. Researchers from the <a href="University_of_Antwerp" title="wikilink">University of Antwerp</a> claim that the day was possible only because it &quot;was carefully planned by an international network of national <a href="social_movement" title="wikilink">social movement</a> organisations.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Immanuel_Wallerstein" title="wikilink">Immanuel Wallerstein</a> has spoken of the international protests as being organised by the forces of &quot;the Porto Alegre camp in reference to the emergence of global social movements who had been organising around international events such as the <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> <a href="World_Social_Forum" title="wikilink">World Social Forum</a> in <a href="Porto_Alegre" title="wikilink">Porto Alegre</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Some commentators claim this is an example of &quot;<a href="grassroots" class="uri" title="wikilink">grassroots</a> <a href="globalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">globalization</a>&quot;, for example one book claims that &quot;The worldwide protests were made possible by globalization ... But make no mistake&lt;U+2014&gt;this was not your <a href="chief_executive_officer" title="wikilink">CEO's</a> globalization. The peace demonstrations represented, not a globalisation of commerce, but a globalization of conscience&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The idea for an international day of demonstrations was first raised by the British <a href="Anti-capitalism" title="wikilink">anti-capitalist</a> group <a href="Globalise_Resistance" title="wikilink">Globalise Resistance</a> (GR) in the wake of an anti-war demonstration in Britain of 400,000 on <a href="28_September" title="wikilink">28 September</a>. At the time GR was involved in planning for the <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a> <a href="European_Social_Forum" title="wikilink">European Social Forum</a> (ESF) and brought up the suggestion at an ESF planning meeting. According to GR's <a href="Chris_Nineham" title="wikilink">Chris Nineham</a>, &quot;There was considerable controversy. Some delegates were worried it would alienate the mainstream of the movement. We, alongside the Italian delegates, had to put up a strong fight to get it accepted.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The proposal was accepted and at the final rally of the ESF, in November 2002, the call officially went out for Europe-wide demonstrations on <a href="15_February" title="wikilink">15 February</a> 2003. This call was firmed up in December at a planning meeting for the next (2003) ESF which took place in <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>. This meeting was attended by delegates from many European anti-war organisations, the US group <a href="United_for_Peace_and_Justice" title="wikilink">United for Peace and Justice</a>, and representatives of groups from the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. The decision was taken to set up a Europe-wide anti-war website and to commit to spreading organisational coordination both within and beyond Europe. An email network connecting the different national organisations across Europe, and eventually also the different US groups, was set up.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2002, the <a href="Cairo_Anti-war_Conference" title="wikilink">Cairo Anti-war Conference</a> pledged to organise demonstrations in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and the <a href="International_Campaign_Against_Aggression_on_Iraq" title="wikilink">International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq</a> (which came out of the Cairo conference) sought to co-ordinate more demonstrations across the world. Around this time, the US anti-war group <a href="A.N.S.W.E.R." title="wikilink">ANSWER</a> called for actions in North America supporting the proposed protests in Europe.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Another important platform for the spreading call to demonstrate internationally occurred at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> which took place at the end of 2002. European delegates sought to popularise the plan for the increasingly international demonstration. They met with some success, including the organisation of an anti-war assembly which was attended by almost 1000 people.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>
<p>Demonstrations took place across Europe and some of the largest drawing attendance figures in the tens of thousands in many cities. Approximately one-fifth of the total demonstrators worldwide protested in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="london">London</h3>
<p>Britain's <a href="Stop_the_War_Coalition" title="wikilink">Stop the War Coalition</a> (StWC) held a protest in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> which it claimed was the largest political demonstration in the city's history. Police estimated attendance in excess of 750,000 people and the demonstration's organisers estimated that around 2 million attended.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The protest was organised under the slogan &quot;No war on Iraq - freedom for <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>&quot;.</p>
<h5 id="organisation">Organisation</h5>
<p><img src="Feb15_Poster.jpg" title="fig:StWC poster advertising the demonstration" alt="StWC poster advertising the demonstration" /> The StWC, who had previously held a series of demonstrations and rallies against the <a href="U.S._invasion_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Afghanistan war</a> and the upcoming Iraq war, called for a national demonstration in London for <a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a>, the agreed-upon international day of protest. The <a href="Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament" title="wikilink">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> (CND) and the <a href="Muslim_Association_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Muslim Association of Britain</a> joined the StWC for this event.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to <a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a>, the StWC was organising the march from a small office donated by the <a href="National_Association_of_Teachers_in_Further_and_Higher_Education" title="wikilink">National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education</a>. As the day approached, it became clear to the organisers that this event would be much larger than any previous rally, so it was agreed that the march would start from two separate locations; <a href="Thames_Embankment" title="wikilink">Thames Embankment</a> for Londoners and those travelling in from the south, and <a href="Gower_Street_(London)" title="wikilink">Gower Street</a> for those travelling in from the midlands and the north. The plan was for the two marches to merge at <a href="Piccadilly_Circus" title="wikilink">Piccadilly Circus</a> and then proceed to a rally at <a href="Hyde_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Hyde Park</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The negotiations for this plan faltered when government <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Culture,_Media_and_Sport" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport</a> <a href="Tessa_Jowell" title="wikilink">Tessa Jowell</a> instructed the <a href="Royal_Parks_of_London" title="wikilink">Royal Parks Agency</a> to deny permission for the rally in Hyde Park - ostensibly for safety reasons and to protect the grass.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This hitch in the StWC&lt;U+2019&gt;s plans was resolved when, after failure to agree on an alternative venue and much pressure from the StWC, this decision was reversed.</p>
<p>The demonstration gained widespread support. It was backed by the <a href="Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Mayor of London</a> <a href="Ken_Livingstone" title="wikilink">Ken Livingstone</a> who used his position to help resolve the administrative issues. Previously the British press had taken a low view of the newsworthiness of demonstrations, with <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> claiming to have a general policy not to cover them. However, sections of the media came over to support this demonstration. For example, The <em><a href="Daily_Mirror" title="wikilink">Daily Mirror</a></em> gave large coverage in the lead up to the march and provided thousands of placards. The demonstration also received sponsorship support from <a href="Greenpeace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenpeace</a> and <a href="Mecca-Cola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mecca-Cola</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>As the march drew near, the BBC predicted that around 500,000 people would attend, while the StWC was hoping for numbers to top the symbolically significant million mark.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="the-event">The event</h5>
<p><img src="London_anti-war_protest_banners.jpg" title="fig:Protesters filled London&#39;s streets" alt="Protesters filled London&#39;s streets" width="240" /> On the day of the protest, the weather was grey and cold, but people were in high spirits even as London became <a href="gridlock" title="wikilink">gridlocked</a> and protesters were stuck for hours at Gower Street and Embankment. Hundreds of coaches brought protesters from 250 towns and cities across the UK,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> with around 100 coaches coming from <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a> alone.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Many commentators noted the diversity of those attending the march. Euan Ferguson noted in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> that: </p>
<p>All police leave in the capital was cancelled for the event, though <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a> later said that it passed off almost without incident.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The fashion <a href="Model_(person)" title="wikilink">model</a> <a href="Kate_Moss" title="wikilink">Kate Moss</a> and <a href="Fashion_design" title="wikilink">designer</a> <a href="Alexander_McQueen" title="wikilink">Alexander McQueen</a> led a group of protesters from the fashion world.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Also among protesters was the <a href="graffiti" class="uri" title="wikilink">graffiti</a> artist <a href="Banksy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banksy</a>, who produced placards for the demonstration with the slogan 'Wrong War'.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Protesters who managed to reach Hyde Park in time heard various speakers, including <a href="George_Galloway" title="wikilink">George Galloway</a>, <a href="Tony_Benn" title="wikilink">Tony Benn</a> and <a href="Bianca_Jagger" title="wikilink">Bianca Jagger</a> but many protesters missed out. Those that had to get coaches back to their home locations had to abandon the march before it had finished and protesters at back end of the march who did stay on did not reach Hyde Park until hours after the speakers and performers had all finished. <a href="Charles_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Charles Kennedy</a>, then the leader of the <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a>, was a late addition to the list of speakers. There was some media speculation that he only decided to speak after a lead article in <em>The Guardian</em> was critical of his absence from the planned speaker list.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>There had been some controversy within the StWC over allowing Kennedy to speak since his party was committed to opposing the war only in the absence of a second UN resolution, but the coalition decided that failing to invite him &quot;would have been divisive for the movement and would have fragmented anti-war opposition to the war.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the size of the march, it is hard to estimate the number of people in attendance. It is probably safe to say that the march was the largest ever political demonstration in the UK<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the biggest taking to the streets since the <a href="Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Golden Jubilee weekend</a> in 2002.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In an <a href="ICM" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICM</a> poll for <em>The Guardian</em> (<a href="14_February" title="wikilink">14 February</a>-<a href="16_February" title="wikilink">16 February</a> <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>), 6% of people claimed that someone from their household went on the march or had intended to. The StWC claims that this translates into 1.25 million households and thus supports the estimate of two million people, assuming that more than one person could come from each household.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>RadioVague, Psand.net and CableRadio broadcast speeches, music and interviews from the event to the internet throughout the day.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="scotland">Scotland</h3>
<p>In addition to the demonstrations in London, the United Kingdom also saw protests in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Anti-war activists planned a demonstration in <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> which would end at the <a href="Scottish_Exhibition_and_Conference_Centre" title="wikilink">Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre</a> (SECC) where the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> was holding a conference for party members. The Labour Party requested that the SECC refuse permission for a stage and PA system outside the conference hall. In response to this the <a href="Scottish_Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Scottish Socialist Party</a> <a href="Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" title="wikilink">MSP</a> <a href="Tommy_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Tommy Sheridan</a> tabled a motion in the <a href="Scottish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Scottish Parliament</a> to allow the event to take place, condemning what he claimed were attempts to &quot;stifle all opposition to warmonger Blair&quot;. The Labour Party was unsuccessful in blocking the demonstrators' plans. Tony Blair was due to give a speech at the same time as the protesters would have arrived outside the conference centre, but the speech was rescheduled to an earlier time to avoid this.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>On the day more than 50,000 people (<em>Guardian</em> estimate) joined the march, which started at <a href="Glasgow_Green" title="wikilink">Glasgow Green</a>. By the time the front of the march had travelled the two miles (3.2 km) to the SECC, Blair had delivered his speech and had left the area. One protester was quoted as saying &quot;We've chased him out of town.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ireland">Ireland</h3>
<p>In <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, the <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> march was only expected to draw 20,000 people, but the actual figure was given variously as 80,000 (police estimate), 90,000 (BBC estimate), 100,000 (<em>Guardian</em> estimate) or 150,000 (<a href="Socialist_Worker" title="wikilink">Socialist Worker</a> (SW) estimate). The march went from Parnell Square, passing the Department of Foreign Affairs at <a href="St._Stephen&#39;s_Green" title="wikilink">St. Stephen's Green</a>, and on to the Dame Street for a rally where popular Irish <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> singer <a href="Christy_Moore" title="wikilink">Christy Moore</a>, <a href="Kila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kila</a> and <a href="Labour_Party_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> politician <a href="Michael_D_Higgins" title="wikilink">Michael D Higgins</a> were among many speakers from the platform. The march disrupted traffic for more than four hours. Protesters demanded that the Irish government stop allowing the United States military to use Ireland's <a href="Shannon_Airport" title="wikilink">Shannon Airport</a> as a transatlantic stop-off point in bringing soldiers to the Middle East.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>The <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Irish</a> march was held in <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a>, where 10,000 (<em>Guardian</em> estimate) to 20,000 (SW estimate) protesters from across the <a href="sectarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">sectarian</a> divide joined the demonstration. The march started at the Arts College at 2:30pm and moved through that Royal Avenue towards <a href="Belfast_City_Hall" title="wikilink">Belfast City Hall</a>. Prominent politicians from <a href="Sinn_F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in" title="wikilink">Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in</a>, the <a href="Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> (SDLP) and the centrist <a href="Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Alliance Party</a> joined the protest. Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in president <a href="Gerry_Adams" title="wikilink">Gerry Adams</a> spoke from the platform at the end rally saying &quot;If President Bush and Mr Blair want war, it should be war against poverty and for equality.&quot; There was also a rally in <a href="Newry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newry</a> in <a href="County_Down" title="wikilink">County Down</a> attending by hundreds of protesters (BBC estimate).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rome">Rome</h3>
<p>The biggest demonstration of the global day of protest took place in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> in Rome. Thirty <a href="train" title="wikilink">trains</a> were specially chartered to bring people to the demonstration, which was organised under the slogan &quot;Stop the war; no ifs or buts&quot;. The organisers were shocked at the size of the turn out and the unexpected number of people forced the demonstration to set off two hours early.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> 650,000 people (police estimate) took place in a final rally at which there were many international speakers including <a href="Kurdish_people" title="wikilink">Kurds</a>, Iraqi dissidents, <a href="Palestinian" title="wikilink">Palestinians</a>, a representative of the <a href="American_Council_of_Christian_Churches" title="wikilink">American Council of Christian Churches</a> and an <a href="Israeli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israeli</a> <a href="conscientious_objector" title="wikilink">conscientious objector</a> who addressed the crowd from a stage hung with <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a>'s <em><a href="Guernica_(painting)" title="wikilink">Guernica</a></em>. The size of the demonstration meant that the majority of demonstrators did not make it into the final rally and in total three million people (organisers' estimate, supported by the Guinness Book of World Records) were on the streets. This was listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="Green_Left_Weekly" title="wikilink">Green Left Weekly</a></em> (GLW), the demonstration contained people from across Italian society; &quot;Catholic nuns and priests marched alongside young people with dreadlocks, nose rings and Palestinian scarves. Christians, anarchists and communists mingled&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="france">France</h3>
<p>In <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, there were demonstrations in somewhere between twenty (<em>Observer</em> estimate) and eighty cities (<a href="WSWS" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSWS</a> estimate); the organisers estimated that over half a million marched in total. The biggest demonstration took place in Paris where around 100,000 (<em><a href="USA_Today" title="wikilink">USA Today</a></em> estimate) to 200,000 (WSWS estimate) people marched through the streets, ending in a rally at the <a href="Place_de_la_Bastille" title="wikilink">Place de la Bastille</a>. This location's role in the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a> was considered to give it a historical significance.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> There was also a demonstration in <a href="Toulouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toulouse</a> of around 10,000 people.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Other activists in California originally planned to hold a protest in <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> on the Saturday but they changed to the Sunday in order not to conflict with the city's <a href="Chinese_New_Year" title="wikilink">Chinese New Year</a>'s parade.

<h2 id="effect">Effect</h2>
<p>At the time, many commentators were hopeful that this global mobilization of unprecedented scale would stop the coming Iraq war. <a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a> writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were &quot;<a href="Second_Superpower" title="wikilink">two superpowers</a> on the planet - the United States, and worldwide public opinion&quot;.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>The unprecedented size of the demonstrations was widely taken to indicate that the majority of people across the world opposed the war. However, the then pro-war Prime Minister of Australia, <a href="John_Howard" title="wikilink">John Howard</a>, claimed that the protests were not representative of public opinion, saying &quot;I don't know that you can measure public opinion just by the number of people that turn up at demonstrations&quot;.</p>
<p>The potential effect of the protests was generally dismissed by pro-war politicians; the then US National Security Advisor <a href="Condoleezza_Rice" title="wikilink">Condoleezza Rice</a> was reported as saying that the protests would &quot;not affect [the US administration's] determination to confront Saddam Hussein and help the Iraqi people&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Her view was borne out as the day of protests, along with the protests that followed it, failed to stop the war. However, the protests and other public opposition have been held up as a key factor in the decisions of the governments of many countries, such as Canada, to not send troops to Iraq.</p>
<p>Though demonstrations against the Iraq war and subsequent occupation have continued none has matched this day in terms of size. One explanation for this that has been suggested is that people have become disillusioned with marching as a political tactic because of the failure of these demonstrations to achieve their explicit aim. In 2006 three years after this day, in an article urging arguing for people to attend a further march, Mike Marqusee put forward two counter arguments to this. Firstly he claimed that it was too soon to judge the long-term significance of the demonstrations noting that &quot;People who took part in the non-cooperation campaigns in India in the <a href="1920s" title="wikilink">20s</a> and <a href="1930s" title="wikilink">30s</a> had to wait a long time for independence.&quot; and that &quot;There were eight years of protest and more than 2 million dead before the Vietnam war came to an end&quot;. Secondly, he claimed that while the effect of marching may be uncertain, the effect of not marching would surely be to make it more likely that the occupation would continue.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Alex_Callinicos" title="wikilink">Alex Callinicos</a> some people argue from the idea that the demonstrations have failed, to the notion that the anti-war movement should concentrate on <a href="direct_action" title="wikilink">direct action</a> rather than mass demonstrations. He argues against this claiming that putting pressure on governments not to join in with &quot;Bush&lt;U+2019&gt;s imperial project&quot; requires an expression of opposition of large numbers of people and claims that &quot;scattered, localised direct actions do not provide the necessary visibility&quot; He further claims that &quot;big national demonstrations are also important in sustaining the momentum of the [anti-war] movement&quot;.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite failing in its explicit aim the <a href="February_15" title="wikilink">February 15</a> global day of anti-war protests had many effects that were not directly intended.
