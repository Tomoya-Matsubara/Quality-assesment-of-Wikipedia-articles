<p>&quot;<strong>The Lemon Song</strong>&quot; is a song by <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>, featured on their <a href="1969_in_music" title="wikilink">1969</a> album <em><a href="Led_Zeppelin_II" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin II</a></em>. It was recorded at Mystic Studios in <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> when the band was on their <a href="Led_Zeppelin_North_American_Tour_Spring_1969" title="wikilink">second concert tour of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lemon Song&quot; is laced with sexual <a href="innuendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">innuendo</a>, and features some of Led Zeppelin's most <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a>-influenced playing. It was recorded virtually live in the studio, and no electronic devices were used to create the echo on <a href="Robert_Plant" title="wikilink">Robert Plant</a>'s vocal. It was made solely by Plant's voice and the acoustics in Mystic Studios, which was a 16 x 16 foot room with wooden walls.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Another notable aspect of this song is <a href="John_Paul_Jones_(musician)" title="wikilink">John Paul Jones</a>' complex bass performance, which is heavily funk influenced. During interviews afterwards, he said that he had improvised during the entire song. It is considered by many to be his best bass performance to date.</p>
<p>The song borrows significantly from <a href="Howlin&#39;_Wolf" title="wikilink">Howlin' Wolf</a>'s &quot;<a href="Killing_Floor_(song)" title="wikilink">Killing Floor</a>&quot;, which was a song Led Zeppelin often incorporated into their live setlist during their first concert tour of the United States. For the <a href="Led_Zeppelin_North_American_Tour_1968/1969" title="wikilink">second</a> and <a href="Led_Zeppelin_North_American_Tour_Spring_1969" title="wikilink">third</a> North American tours the song evolved into &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, with Plant often <a href="improvisation" title="wikilink">improvising</a> lyrics onstage. However, despite Howlin' Wolf's influence on the arrangement, the album sleeve of <em>Led Zeppelin II</em> initially credited only the four members of Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Other lyrics, notably &quot;squeeze (my <a href="lemon" class="uri" title="wikilink">lemon</a>) 'til the juice runs down my leg,&quot; can be traced to <a href="Robert_Johnson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Robert Johnson</a>'s &quot;<a href="Traveling_Riverside_Blues" title="wikilink">Traveling Riverside Blues</a>&quot;. It is most likely that Johnson borrowed this himself, from a song recorded in the same year (1937) called &quot;She Squeezed My Lemon&quot; (by Arthur McKay).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Robert Johnson's name has never been added to the credits for &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;. The song also borrowed from <a href="Albert_King" title="wikilink">Albert King</a>'s &quot;Cross-Cut Saw&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;The Lemon Song&quot; was performed live on Led Zeppelin's first three <a href="concert_tour" title="wikilink">concert tours</a> of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> (on the first tour as &quot;Killing Floor&quot;), before being dropped from their live set in late <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>. However, the 'squeeze my lemon' sequence continued to be inserted into the &quot;<a href="Whole_Lotta_Love" title="wikilink">Whole Lotta Love</a>&quot; medley and ad-libbed elsewhere.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 1972, Arc Music, owner of the publishing rights to <a href="Howlin&#39;_Wolf" title="wikilink">Howlin' Wolf</a>'s songs, sued Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement on &quot;The Lemon Song.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The parties settled out of court. Though the amount was not disclosed, Wolf received a check for $45,123 from Arc Music immediately following the suit.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> (Interestingly, Wolf sued Arc Music less than two years later.)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Today, Chester Burnett (<a href="Howlin&#39;_Wolf" title="wikilink">Howlin' Wolf</a>'s real name) has the songwriting credit for &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Jimmy_Page" title="wikilink">Jimmy Page</a> performed this song on his tour with <a href="The_Black_Crowes" title="wikilink">The Black Crowes</a> in 1999. A version of &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; performed by Page and The Black Crowes can be found on the album <em><a href="Live_at_the_Greek" title="wikilink">Live at the Greek</a></em>.</p>
