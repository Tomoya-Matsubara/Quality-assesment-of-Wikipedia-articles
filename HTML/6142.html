<p><strong>Anna Anderson</strong> (16 December 1896Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 12 February 1984) was the best known of <a href="Romanov_impostors" title="wikilink">several impostors</a> who claimed to be <a href="Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The real Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Nicholas II</a> and <a href="Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" title="wikilink">Alexandra</a>, was <a href="Shooting_of_the_Romanov_family" title="wikilink">killed along with her parents and siblings</a> on 17 July 1918 by <a href="Communism" title="wikilink">communist</a> revolutionaries in <a href="Ekaterinburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ekaterinburg</a>, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>; but the location of her body was unknown until 2008.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920, Anderson was institutionalized in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>. At first, she went by the name <em>Fr&lt;U+00E4&gt;ulein Unbekannt</em> (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a <a href="Grand_duke#Russian_grand_dukes" title="wikilink">Russian grand duchess</a> first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family and those who had known her, including court tutor <a href="Pierre_Gilliard" title="wikilink">Pierre Gilliard</a>, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, <a href="Ernest_Louis,_Grand_Duke_of_Hesse" title="wikilink">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, identified Anderson as <strong>Franziska Schanzkowska</strong>, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1922 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968, and shortly before the expiry of her visa married Jack Manahan, a <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> history professor who was later characterized as &quot;probably <a href="Charlottesville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charlottesville</a>'s best-loved eccentric&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Upon her death in 1984, Anderson's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at <a href="Seeon_Abbey" title="wikilink">Castle Seeon, Germany</a>. After the <a href="Revolutions_of_1989" title="wikilink">collapse of communism</a> in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed and multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through <a href="DNA_testing" title="wikilink">DNA testing</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> DNA tests on a lock of Anderson's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that Anderson's DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Instead, Anderson's <a href="mitochondrial_DNA" title="wikilink">mitochondrial DNA</a> matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>On 27 February 1920,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> a young woman attempted to take her own life in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> by jumping off the Bendlerbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;cke into the <a href="Landwehrkanal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Landwehrkanal</a>. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the Elisabeth Hospital on L&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzowstrasse. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as <em>Fr&lt;U+00E4&gt;ulein Unbekannt (Miss Unknown)</em> to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now Wittenau, in <a href="Reinickendorf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reinickendorf</a>), where she remained for the next two years.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> She had scars on her head and body,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and spoke German with an accent described as &quot;Russian&quot; by medical staff.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was the <a href="Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia</a>, one of the four daughters of Tsar <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Nicholas II of Russia</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On her release, Peuthert told <a href="White_&lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Russian &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> Captain Nicholas von Schwabe that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Schwabe persuaded other &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s to visit the unknown woman, including Zinaida <a href="Tolstoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tolstoy</a>, a friend of the Tsarina <a href="Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" title="wikilink">Alexandra</a>. Eventually Baroness <a href="Sophie_Buxhoeveden" title="wikilink">Sophie Buxhoeveden</a>, a former <a href="lady-in-waiting" class="uri" title="wikilink">lady-in-waiting</a> to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared &quot;She's too short for Tatiana,&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A few days later, the unknown woman noted, &quot;I did not say I was Tatiana.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>A nurse at Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed years after the patient's release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar, <a href="Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Anastasia</a>, in the autumn of 1921.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, the patient herself could not recall the incident.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> or weave it into their narrative.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>By May 1922 the woman was believed by Peuthert, Schwabe and Tolstoy to be Anastasia. Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nevertheless, the woman was taken out of the asylum and hosted at the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; who had been a police chief in <a href="Congress_Poland" title="wikilink">Russian Poland</a> before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nberg, thought Kleist &quot;may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> though Peuthert &quot;described her everywhere as Anastasia&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and Inspector Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nberg's estate at Funkenm&lt;U+00FC&gt;hle, near <a href="Zossen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zossen</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> At Funkenm&lt;U+00FC&gt;hle, Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, <a href="Princess_Irene_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine" title="wikilink">Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine</a>, to meet Tschaikovsky but Irene did not recognize her.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Gr&lt;U+00FC&gt;nberg also arranged a visit from <a href="Duchess_Cecilie_of_Mecklenburg-Schwerin" title="wikilink">Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia</a>, but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> but Cecilie's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber <a href="Aleksei_Andreyevich_Volkov" title="wikilink">Alexei Volkov</a>; Anastasia's tutor <a href="Pierre_Gilliard" title="wikilink">Pierre Gilliard</a>; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister <a href="Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>. Though they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declaration, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In March 1926, she convalesced in <a href="Lugano" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugano</a> with <a href="Harriet_von_Rathlef" title="wikilink">Harriet von Rathlef</a> at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, <a href="Prince_Valdemar_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Prince Valdemar of Denmark</a>. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, <a href="Herluf_Zahle" title="wikilink">Herluf Zahle</a>, while her identity was investigated.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as &quot;Anastasia Tschaikovsky&quot;, with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> After a quarrel with von Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at <a href="Oberstdorf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oberstdorf</a> in the <a href="Bavarian_Alps" title="wikilink">Bavarian Alps</a> in June 1926, and von Rathlef returned to Berlin.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the head of the Russian Refugee office in Berlin, and the daughter of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. <a href="Eugene_Botkin" title="wikilink">Eugene Botkin</a>, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child, and had last spoken to her in February 1917.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia even though &quot;the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In a letter, Melnik wrote: &quot;Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narrationÂ ... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical GermanÂ ... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to &quot;aid the patient's weak memory&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> or as part of a deliberate charade,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.</p>

<p>In 1927, under pressure from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> <a href="Duke_of_Leuchtenberg" title="wikilink">Duke George of Leuchtenberg</a>, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at <a href="Seeon_Abbey" title="wikilink">Castle Seeon</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The Tsarina's brother, <a href="Ernest_Louis,_Grand_Duke_of_Hesse" title="wikilink">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> when, shortly after her fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt; had been killed at the front, a grenade fell out of her hand and exploded.

Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> but the affidavit he signed spoke only of &quot;strong resemblance&quot;, highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

A suitable amnesiac, &quot;Anna&quot;, is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Another film was released at the same time, <em><a href="The_Story_of_Anastasia" title="wikilink">Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?</a></em> starring <a href="Lilli_Palmer" title="wikilink">Lilli Palmer</a>, which covers much the same ground, but the central character is &quot;perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity&quot;.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn56">Anderson's supporters claimed that Ernest Louis' hostility towards Anderson arose from her allegation that they had last met when he had visited Russia in 1916. Anderson claimed that in the midst of a war between Russia and Germany, Ernest Louis had visited Russia to negotiate a separate peace. Ernest Louis denied the allegation, which if true would have been tantamount to treason. There was no conclusive proof either way.
