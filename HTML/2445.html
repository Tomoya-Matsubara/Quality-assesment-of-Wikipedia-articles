<p><strong>Bardanes</strong>, surnamed <strong><em>Tourkos</em></strong>, &quot;the Turk&quot; (, <a href="floruit" title="wikilink">fl.</a> 705&lt;U+2013&gt;803), was a <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> general of <a href="Armenians" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> origin who launched an unsuccessful rebellion against Emperor <a href="Nikephoros_I" title="wikilink">Nikephoros I</a> (r. 802&lt;U+2013&gt;811) in 803. Although a major supporter of <a href="Byzantine_empress" title="wikilink">Byzantine empress</a> <a href="Irene_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Irene of Athens</a> (r. 797&lt;U+2013&gt;802), soon after her overthrow he was appointed by Nikephoros as commander-in-chief of the <a href="Anatolia" title="wikilink">Anatolian</a> armies. From this position he launched a revolt in July 803, probably in opposition to Nikephoros' economic and religious policies. His troops marched towards <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, but failed to win popular support. At this point some of his major supporters deserted him and, reluctant to engage the loyalist forces in battle, Bardanes gave up and chose to surrender himself. He retired as a monk to a monastery he had founded. There he was blinded, possibly on Nikephoros' orders.</p>

<p><img src="Solidus-Irene-sb1599.jpg" title="fig:Gold solidus of Empress Irene, during the period of her sole rule (797&lt;U+2013&gt;802)" alt="Gold solidus of Empress Irene, during the period of her sole rule (797&lt;U+2013&gt;802)" width="250" /> Nothing is known of the early life of Bardanes. He is usually regarded as an Armenian on account of his first name (a hellenized form of <a href="Vardan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vardan</a>), whilst his sobriquet &quot;<em>Tourkos</em>&quot;, which was bestowed upon him, probably disparagingly, only <em>after</em> his revolt, could suggest a <a href="Khazar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazar</a> origin.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Bardanes is probably identical with the <em><a href="patrikios" class="uri" title="wikilink">patrikios</a></em> Bardanios who appears in the chronicle of <a href="Theophanes_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Theophanes the Confessor</a> in the mid-790s. In 795, he was <a href="Domestic_of_the_Schools" title="wikilink">Domestic of the Schools</a>, and was dispatched to arrest the monk <a href="Plato_of_Sakkoudion" title="wikilink">Plato of Sakkoudion</a> for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor <a href="Constantine_VI" title="wikilink">Constantine VI</a> (r. 780&lt;U+2013&gt;797) to Plato's niece <a href="Theodote" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theodote</a>. In 797, as <em><a href="strategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategos</a></em> of the <a href="Thracesian_Theme" title="wikilink">Thracesian Theme</a>, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother <a href="Irene_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Irene of Athens</a> when she usurped the throne from her son Constantine VI.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Irene herself was overthrown and exiled by the <em><a href="logothetes_tou_genikou" title="wikilink">logothetes tou genikou</a></em> (finance minister) Nikephoros on 31 October 802. At the time, Bardanes was <em><a href="patrikios" class="uri" title="wikilink">patrikios</a></em> and <em>strategos</em> of the Thracesians, but was soon transferred to command the powerful <a href="Anatolic_Theme" title="wikilink">Anatolic Theme</a>. In the next year, probably in preparation for a campaign against the Arabs after Nikephoros' refusal to continue the annual payment of tribute to the <a href="Abbasid_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, the emperor appointed Bardanes to the exceptional post of <em><a href="monostrategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">monostrategos</a></em> (&quot;single-general&quot;, in effect commander-in-chief) of the Empire's five <a href="Anatolia" title="wikilink">Anatolian</a> land <a href="thema" title="wikilink">themes</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="revolt">Revolt</h2>
<p><img src="Solidus-Nicephorus_I_and_Staraucius-sb1604.jpg" title="fig:Gold solidus of Nikephoros I and his son and co-emperor, Staurakios." alt="Gold solidus of Nikephoros I and his son and co-emperor, Staurakios." width="250" /> In mid-July 803 (various dates are given by modern scholars: 16, 18 or 19), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, <a href="Opsikion" title="wikilink">Opsician</a>, Thracesian and <a href="Bucellarian_Theme" title="wikilink">Bucellarian</a> themes. Crucially, the <a href="Armeniac_Theme" title="wikilink">Armeniac Theme</a>, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up with the rest of the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory of enmity amongst its troops.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The chroniclers agree that the troops were motivated chiefly by economical concerns: Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances, and the soldiers had apparently been left unpaid for some time. Bardanes on the other hand had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>For Bardanes himself, the situation is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers to allow him to leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, <a href="Thomas_the_Slav" title="wikilink">Thomas</a>, <a href="Leo_V_the_Armenian" title="wikilink">Leo the Armenian</a> and <a href="Michael_II" title="wikilink">Michael the Amorian</a> visited a holy man at <a href="Philomelion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philomelion</a> to learn of his prospects. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. If true and not a later invention, this may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was also a member of the landed aristocracy and a devoted <a href="iconophile" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconophile</a> who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of traditional elites' opposition to Nikephoros' policies, both in the confessional area, where the emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros' usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death however at <a href="Lesbos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lesbos</a> on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The revolt probably took place at <a href="Amorion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amorion</a>, the capital of the Anatolic Theme. From there, the rebel army marched north and west, following the military road to <a href="Nicomedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicomedia</a> and then to <a href="Chrysopolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysopolis</a>, the town that lay across the <a href="Bosporus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bosporus</a> from the imperial capital, <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>. There Bardanes encamped for eight days, awaiting some revolt against Nikephoros inside the capital in response to his own rebellion. Since this did not materialize, and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic, he withdrew to the great army base at <a href="Malagina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malagina</a>. There two of his associates, Michael the Amorian and Leo the Armenian, abandoned him, and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection: Michael became Count of the Tent, and Leo was appointed commander of the <em><a href="Foederati" class="uri" title="wikilink">Foederati</a></em> regiment.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>This desertion further discouraged Bardanes, and, reluctant to face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the <em><a href="hegumenos" class="uri" title="wikilink">hegumenos</a></em> of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the <a href="Patriarch_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Patriarch</a> <a href="Patriarch_Tarasios_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Tarasios</a> and several leading <a href="Byzantine_Senate" title="wikilink">senators</a> which guaranteed that neither he nor his subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through <a href="Nicaea_(city)" title="wikilink">Nicaea</a> he sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at <a href="Cius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cius</a>. From there he embarked on a ship that took him to the island of <a href="Prote" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prote</a>. Taking the <a href="monastic_name" title="wikilink">monastic name</a> Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath-of-the-revolt">Aftermath of the revolt</h2>
<p>After Bardanes' retirement, Nikephoros formally dismissed him and confiscated much of his property. The other thematic generals who took part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, along with several prominent bishops from western Anatolia, while the soldiers were left unpaid for a year.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 803 however (Treadgold puts it in 804), a group of &quot;<a href="Lycaonia" title="wikilink">Lycaonian</a>&quot; (possibly <a href="Paulician" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paulician</a>) soldiers disembarked at Prote and blinded Bardanes. It is likely that this was done at the behest of the emperor himself, although in a later public statement before the Senate, Nikephoros swore that he had nothing to do with it. Although most scholars believe in Nikephoros' direct involvement, Treadgold believes that the soldiers acted on their own, since Bardanes was no longer a credible threat. At any rate, despite pressure from the Patriarch and the Senate to punish them, and his own pledge to do so, Nikephoros let them go.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Bardanes' revolt temporarily weakened Byzantium, especially in its capability to deal with the Arab threat to the East, but its short duration and lack of major military confrontations did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>Bardanes was married to a woman named Domnika, with whom he had several daughters. <a href="Thekla,_wife_of_Michael_II" title="wikilink">Thekla</a>, the wife of Michael the Amorian, is usually identified with one of them, as <a href="Theophanes_Continuatus" title="wikilink">Theophanes Continuatus</a> records that she was the daughter of the commander of the Anatolic Theme, under whom Michael served. After Bardanes' confinement to Prote, Domenika was allowed to use part of her husband's fortune to found a small monastery in Constantinople, where she withdrew along with her one unmarried daughter and stepdaughters.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
