<p><strong>Auel Neider</strong> is a fictional character in the <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> series <a href="Gundam_SEED_Destiny" title="wikilink">Gundam SEED Destiny</a>. He's voiced by <a href="Masakazu_Morita" title="wikilink">Masakazu Morita</a> in the original Japanese version and <a href="Brad_Swaile" title="wikilink">Brad Swaile</a> in the English dub. </p>
<p>Auel, together with <a href="Sting_Oakley" title="wikilink">Sting Oakley</a> and <a href="Stellar_Loussier" title="wikilink">Stellar Loussier</a>, is one of the three Extended pilots of the Earth Alliance&lt;U+2019&gt;s special forces team Phantom Pain. He is the most impulsive and brutal of the three, killing his enemies mercilessly and even laughing crazily when he kills many people. Together with his comrades, he sneaks into the PLANT colony Armory One, where he steals one of the three new Gundam-type <a href="mobile_suits" title="wikilink">mobile suits</a>, the <a href="ZGMF-X31S_Abyss_Gundam" title="wikilink">ZGMF-X31S Abyss</a>. He uses the heavily armed suit to wrack havoc inside the colony, killing many <a href="ZAFT" class="uri" title="wikilink">ZAFT</a> soldiers.</p>
<p>He is later involved in two other battles in space (the first in the debris belt, the second on the remnants of the destroyed PLANT colony Junius 7) and after the start of the <a href="Second_Bloody_Valentine_War" title="wikilink">Second Bloody Valentine War</a>, Auel and the rest of the Phantom Pain go to Earth. They are involved in several battles against the ZAFT ship <em><a href="Minerva_class_battleship" title="wikilink">Minerva</a></em>, but are met with no great success. Auel is able to sink one <a href="Vosgulov_class_submarine" title="wikilink">Vosgulov class submarine</a>, which came to the aid of the Minerva.</p>
<p>Auel and his two comrades later investigate the ZAFT-controlled city Diokia, where the three meet enemies <a href="Shinn_Asuka" title="wikilink">Shinn Asuka</a> and <a href="Athrun_Zala" title="wikilink">Athrun Zala</a> for the first time; neither party realizes who the other is. When ZAFT discovers a laboratory in Lodonia, Auel recalls that his mother was stationed there and promptly begins to freak out. Because of his psychological conditioning, he is rendered helpless when he hears his blockword, in his case the word &quot;mother&quot;. Auel, in his confusion, says it out loud to himself and collapses in tears. The doctors on the ship quickly move to readjust his mentality.</p>
<p>During a fight against the Minerva at the Dardanelles, the Abyss is damaged by the <a href="ZGMF-X10A_Freedom_Gundam" title="wikilink">ZGMF-X10A Freedom</a>, but it is quickly repaired.</p>
<p>Shortly after Stellar is captured and taken on board the Minerva, Auel and Sting had all of their memories of her erased. The latter recalled nothing, but Auel felt that something was missing, suggesting that his amnesia was not complete. During the <a href="Second_Bloody_Valentine_War" title="wikilink">Battle of Crete</a> his suit is destroyed by Shinn Asuka when he uses the beam javelin of his <a href="ZGMF-X56S_Impulse_Gundam" title="wikilink">ZGMF-X56S/&lt;U+03B3&gt; Blast Impulse</a> to stab directly into the abdomen of the Abyss, causing it to crash on the sea. The Abyss explodes under water, shortly after blood-mixed water filled Auel's helmet, confirming his death.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before Destiny came out, most anime news sites have said <a href="Richard_Ian_Cox" title="wikilink">Richard Ian Cox</a> would portray Auel in the English dub. The mistake was noted when Swaile's name was credited, though it has yet to be corrected.</li>
<li>Auel's trigger word is &quot;mother&quot;, probably because his mother was one of the staff that was killed in the struggle. When the word is said around him, he suffers from a flashback just before the lab was suppose to be destroyed. He then yells out for someone to save his mom.</li>
<li>Auel often used Stellar as a weapon by saying her trigger word when the trio is in trouble.</li>
<li>In the fight against ZAFT guards at the Armory One, Auel's movements in battle very closely resemble the <a href="Gun_Kata" title="wikilink">Gun Kata</a> technique.</li>
<li>In the Suit CDs, he is featured in Volume 7, along with the two other Extendeds. The audio drama clip has them discussing about <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>.</li>
