<p>A <strong>winter service vehicle</strong> (<strong>WSV</strong>), also known as a <strong>snow removal unit</strong> or <strong>snow removal vehicle</strong>, is a <a href="vehicle" class="uri" title="wikilink">vehicle</a> used to perform <a href="snow_removal" title="wikilink">snow removal</a>, the clearing of roads or other thoroughfares of <a href="ice" class="uri" title="wikilink">ice</a> or <a href="snow" class="uri" title="wikilink">snow</a>, which is difficult to cross and reduces the <a href="traction_(engineering)" title="wikilink">traction</a> of <a href="motor_vehicle" title="wikilink">motor vehicles</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Winter service vehicles are usually based on <a href="dump_truck" title="wikilink">dump truck</a> chassis, with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed snow removal equipment, although many authorities also keep a number of smaller vehicles for use on <a href="Sidewalk" title="wikilink">pavements</a>, <a href="footpath" title="wikilink">footpaths</a> and <a href="cycleway" title="wikilink">cycleways</a>. Road maintenance agencies and contractors in areas with <a href="temperate" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperate</a> or <a href="polar_climate" title="wikilink">polar climates</a> often own multiple winter service vehicles in order to keep the road network clear of snow and ice and safe for driving during the <a href="winter" class="uri" title="wikilink">winter</a> months.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Winter service vehicles are also employed by <a href="airport" title="wikilink">airports</a>, in order to keep <a href="runway" title="wikilink">runways</a> and taxiways free of snow and ice, which pose a danger to aircraft <a href="takeoff" title="wikilink">taking off</a> and <a href="landing" class="uri" title="wikilink">landing</a> and can interfere with communication equipment.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest winter service vehicles were snow rollers, designed to maintain a smooth, even road surface for <a href="sled" title="wikilink">sleds</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> although <a href="Horse-drawn_vehicle" title="wikilink">horse-drawn</a> <a href="snowplough" title="wikilink">snowploughs</a> and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The increase in motor car traffic and <a href="aviation" class="uri" title="wikilink">aviation</a> in the early 20th century lead to the development and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles. Today, most cities in areas prone to snow or ice operate fleets of winter service vehicles to keep roads and footpaths safe and clear.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Schneepflug_pferdzug.jpg" title="fig:An early horse-drawn snowplough at the Rosstag Burggen, a historical reenactment of life in 19th century Germany." alt="An early horse-drawn snowplough at the Rosstag Burggen, a historical reenactment of life in 19th century Germany." /> Although the concept of snow removal has existed since at least the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, early attempts merely involved using a <a href="shovel" class="uri" title="wikilink">shovel</a> or broom to remove the snow from walkways and roads.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Before the invention of motorised transport, snow removal was seen as less of a concern: the unpaved roads present in rural areas were dangerous and bumpy; snow and ice made the surface far smoother. Most farmers could simply replace their wagons with <a href="sled" title="wikilink">sleds</a>, allowing the transport of heavy materials such as timber with relative ease.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Early communities in the northern regions of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> even used <a href="Animal_powered_transport" title="wikilink">animal-drawn</a> snow rollers, the earliest winter service vehicles, to compress the snow covering roads. The compression increased the life of the snow and increased the ease of passage for sleds; some communities even employed snow wardens, whose job it was to spread or &quot;pave&quot; snow onto areas which were still exposed such as bridges to allow the sleds to use these routes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>However, with the increase in <a href="Pavement_(material)" title="wikilink">paved roads</a> and the increasing size of cities, the process of snow-paving fell out of favour, as the smooth surfaces produced posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest <a href="patent" title="wikilink">patents</a> for snowploughs date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of <a href="Milwaukee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milwaukee</a> began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with <a href="snowplough" title="wikilink">snowploughs</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The horse-drawn snowplough quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.</p>
<p>The first motorised snowploughs were developed in 1913, based on truck and <a href="tractor" class="uri" title="wikilink">tractor</a> bodies, while the earliest <a href="snow_blower" title="wikilink">snow blower</a>, the Barber-Green snowloader, was invented in 1920. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labour required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The expansion of the <a href="aviation" class="uri" title="wikilink">aviation</a> industry also acted as a catalyst for the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century: as even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, large fences were erected around airfields to prevent <a href="snowdrift" title="wikilink">snowdrifts</a> forming and airports began to maintain fleets of winter service vehicles to keep the runways clear in heavy weather.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>With the popularisation of the <a href="motor_car" title="wikilink">motor car</a>, it was found that ploughing alone was insufficient for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of <a href="Winter_service_vehicle#Gritter" title="wikilink">gritting vehicles</a>, which used <a href="sodium_chloride" title="wikilink">sodium chloride</a> to accelerate the melting of the snow.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of <a href="car_crash" title="wikilink">motoring accidents</a> increased, the protests subsided and by 1925 many cities in the United States used salt and sand to improve clear the roads and increase road safety.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, as <a href="environmentalism" title="wikilink">environmental awareness</a> increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again fell out of favour as the environmental impact of grit was discovered, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Winter service vehicle drivers usually work <a href="part_time" title="wikilink">part time</a>, before and during inclement weather only, with drivers working a 12 to 16 hour shift.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Main roads are typically gritted in advance, in order to reduce the disruption to the network.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Salt barns are provided at regular intervals for drivers to collect more grit, and bedding is provided at depots for drivers to use between shifts in heavy or prolonged storms.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Weather conditions typically vary greatly depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive very little in low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid <a href="frost" class="uri" title="wikilink">frost</a> formation.

<h3 id="de-icer">De-icer</h3>

<p><img src="Aircraft_Deicing_Syracuse.jpg" title="fig:A de-icing vehicle treating an American Airlines MD-80 at Syracuse Hancock International Airport, New York." alt="A de-icing vehicle treating an American Airlines MD-80 at Syracuse Hancock International Airport, New York." /> De-icers spray heated <a href="de-icing_fluid" title="wikilink">de-icing fluid</a>, often <a href="propylene_glycol" title="wikilink">propylene glycol</a> or <a href="ethylene_glycol" title="wikilink">ethylene glycol</a>, onto icy surfaces such as the bodies of aircraft and road surfaces.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> These prevent ice from forming on the body of the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide. Ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.</p>
<p>Aircraft de-icing vehicles usually consist of a large <a href="tanker_truck" title="wikilink">tanker truck</a>, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a <a href="cherry_picker" title="wikilink">cherry picker</a> crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire <a href="Boeing_737" title="wikilink">Boeing 737</a> can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Some road contractors also choose to use de-icers as an alternative to gritters; the vehicle carries a tank of <a href="brine" class="uri" title="wikilink">brine</a>, which is sprayed on the road surface. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Airport runways are also de-iced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gritter">Gritter</h3>
<p><img src="Schneepflug_Strasse_hinten.jpg" title="fig:The hopper and impeller of a gritter in Germany." alt="The hopper and impeller of a gritter in Germany." /> A gritter, also known as a sander,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> salt spreader or salt truck,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Gritters are used to spread grit, a mixture of <a href="sand" class="uri" title="wikilink">sand</a> and <a href="halite" title="wikilink">rock salt</a>, onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, and spread across the roadway by an <a href="impeller" class="uri" title="wikilink">impeller</a>. Salt reduces the melting point of ice by <a href="freezing-point_depression" title="wikilink">freezing-point depression</a>, causing it to melt at lower temperatures and run off harmlessly to the edge of the road, while sand increases traction by increasing <a href="friction" class="uri" title="wikilink">friction</a> between car <a href="tyre" title="wikilink">tyres</a> and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately 10 <a href="gram" title="wikilink">grams</a> per <a href="square_metre" title="wikilink">square metre</a> (0.3 <a href="ounce" title="wikilink">oz</a>/<a href="square_yard" title="wikilink">yd&lt;U+00B2&gt;</a>) is dropped, while thick snow can require up to 40 g/m&lt;U+00B2&gt; (1.2 oz/yd&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The grit is sometimes mixed with <a href="molasses" class="uri" title="wikilink">molasses</a> to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road and can become addicted to the sugar.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The grit is sometimes heated as it is passed out of the nozzle; this helps melt the ice and improves the <a href="solubility" class="uri" title="wikilink">solubility</a> of the salt. Quieter rural roads may be considered too minor to grit, so <a href="grit_bin" title="wikilink">grit bins</a> are often provided, containing a mixture of sand and salt for drivers and pedestrians to shovel onto the road themselves.</p>
<p>Gritters are among the winter service vehicles also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the <a href="airframe" class="uri" title="wikilink">airframe</a> of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous <a href="potassium_acetate" title="wikilink">potassium acetate</a> onto the runways instead, as potassium acetate does not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The salt dropped by gritters comes from a <a href="renewable" title="wikilink">non-renewable</a> source, and high concentrations of salt in soil kill plants, so it is in the interest of operators to limit gritting to an absolute minimum. As a result, road maintenance agencies have advanced networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The salt dropped is eventually washed away and lost, so it cannot be reused or collected after gritting runs, although the insoluble sand can be collected and recycled by <a href="Street_sweeper" title="wikilink">street sweeping vehicles</a> and mixed with new salt crystals to be reused in later batches of grit.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> As a result, operators must regularly purchase large quantities of rock salt, depleting a finite resource and damaging the environment through dangerous and polluting <a href="salt_mining" title="wikilink">salt mining</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In some areas of the world, including <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, dropping salt is prohibited altogether, except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand, without any melting agents, is spread instead. Although this protects the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; and as the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for <a href="bus" title="wikilink">buses</a> to pull in at <a href="bus_stop" title="wikilink">bus stops</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Other areas use alternative chemicals which are less harmful to the environment and cause less corrosion damage to metallic structures: the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> uses <a href="magnesium_chloride" title="wikilink">magnesium chloride</a>, a relatively cheap chemical similar in <a href="molecular_structure" title="wikilink">molecular structure</a> to sodium chloride, but less reactive,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> while <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> uses <a href="calcium_magnesium_acetate" title="wikilink">calcium magnesium acetate</a>, which avoids the environmentally harmful <a href="chloride" class="uri" title="wikilink">chloride</a> <a href="ion" class="uri" title="wikilink">ion</a> altogether.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Gritting vehicles are also dangerous to <a href="overtaking" title="wikilink">overtake</a>; as grit is scattered across the entire roadway, loose pieces can damage the paintwork and windows of passing cars, and the loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for <a href="motorcycle" title="wikilink">motorcycles</a>, which can lead to <a href="skid" title="wikilink">skiding</a>, especially around corners.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>Snow blowers, also known as rotating snowploughs or snow cutters,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> can be used in place of snowploughs on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning blade which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached to the top of the blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than ploughs, with some clearing in excess of 5000 <a href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonnes</a> of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplough can.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the <a href="windrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">windrow</a> from blocking driveways.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> However, snow blowing is an energy intensive and environmentally unfriendly process, producing higher levels of <a href="air_pollution" title="wikilink">air pollution</a> and <a href="noise_pollution" title="wikilink">noise pollution</a> than other methods of snow removal.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="snow-groomer">Snow groomer</h3>

<p><img src="Pistenfahrzeug.jpg" title="fig:A modern snow groomer mounted to the rear of a snowcat in Hautes-Pyr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;es, France." alt="A modern snow groomer mounted to the rear of a snowcat in Hautes-Pyr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;es, France." /> A snow groomer is a machine designed to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers were used by residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and consisted of a heavy <a href="Roller_(agricultural_tool)" title="wikilink">roller</a> hauled by <a href="oxen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxen</a> which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> With the invention of the motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowploughs and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at <a href="ski_resort" title="wikilink">ski resorts</a>, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including <a href="skiing" class="uri" title="wikilink">skiing</a>, <a href="snowboarding" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowboarding</a> and <a href="snowmobiling" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowmobiling</a>. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or <a href="snowcat" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowcat</a> and then hauled across the area to be groomed.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> With the development of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce <a href="half-pipe" title="wikilink">half-pipes</a> and <a href="Mini_ramp" title="wikilink">ramps</a> for snowboarding.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Snow groomers are also used in conjunction with <a href="snow_cannon" title="wikilink">snow cannons</a>, in order to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort; grooming removes nutrients and minerals from the soil underneath the snow and the regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the <a href="infiltration_(hydrology)" title="wikilink">infiltration</a> rate of the soil while decreasing the <a href="field_capacity" title="wikilink">field capacity</a>, thereby increasing the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="snow-melter">Snow melter</h3>

<p><img src="Snow_melter.jpg" title="fig:Snow melters working at JFK Airport, New York." alt="Snow melters working at JFK Airport, New York." /> A snow melting vehicle works by scooping snow into a melting pit located in a large tank at the rear of the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a smaller tank full of boiling water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the <a href="storm_drain" title="wikilink">storm drains</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>As they have to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner. snow melting machines tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by <a href="semi-trailer_truck" title="wikilink">semi-trailer</a> <a href="tractor_unit" title="wikilink">tractor units</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plough or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 tonnes of snow per hour, compared to the 5000 tonnes per hour capacity of any large snow blower.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> However, snow melters are far more environmentally friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can be separated from the meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, as the snow is melted on board, the costs of removing the collected snow from the site is removed.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="snowplough">Snowplough</h3>

<p><img src="Schneepflug_Strasse_vorne.jpg" title="fig:A German snowplough with a hopper for carrying grit." alt="A German snowplough with a hopper for carrying grit." /> Many winter service vehicles can be fitted with snowploughs, in order to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. Most winter service vehicles include either permanently fixed ploughs or plough frames: 75% of the UK's <a href="Highways_Agency" title="wikilink">Highways Agency</a> vehicles include a plough frame to which a blade can be attached.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In most cases, the ploughs are mounted on <a href="hydraulics" title="wikilink">hydraulically</a>-actuated arms, allowing them to be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. In the event that specially designed winter service vehicles are not available for ploughing, other service or <a href="construction_vehicle" title="wikilink">construction vehicles</a> can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are <a href="grader" title="wikilink">graders</a>,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> <a href="bulldozer" title="wikilink">bulldozers</a>,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <a href="skid_loader" title="wikilink">skid loaders</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and <a href="rubbish_truck" title="wikilink">rubbish trucks</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> <a href="Front-end_loader" title="wikilink">Front-end loaders</a> can also be used to plough snow: they can use a snowplough attachment which mounts on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or they can use their bucket or snowbasket to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplough or dump truck which then hauls it away.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Snowploughs are dangerous to <a href="overtaking" title="wikilink">overtake</a>; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plough blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="surface-friction-tester">Surface friction tester</h3>
<p>The surface friction tester is a small fifth wheel attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, canted slightly relative to the ground, generally used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The wheel is allowed to turn freely, allowing sensors attached to the axis of the wheel to calculate the friction between the wheel and the driving surface by the measuring the <a href="torque" class="uri" title="wikilink">torque</a> produced by the rotation of the wheel. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing routes to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, in order to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The sensors are usually mounted to small <a href="Compact_car" title="wikilink">compact</a> or <a href="estate_car" title="wikilink">estate cars</a> or to a small <a href="Trailer_(vehicle)" title="wikilink">trailer</a>, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to lightweight vehicles.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
