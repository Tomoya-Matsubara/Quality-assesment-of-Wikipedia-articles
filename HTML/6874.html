<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="CSULA_GOLDEN_EAGLE.jpg" title="fig:|right|thumb|Golden Eagle A bronze sculpture of CSULA mascot." alt="|right|thumb|Golden Eagle A bronze sculpture of CSULA mascot." /> The campus is nestled among rolling hills on a site that once housed one of <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>'s 36 original adobes, built in <a href="1776" class="uri" title="wikilink">1776</a> by <a href="Franciscan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Franciscan</a> missionaries and destroyed by fire in 1908. These lands once were part of a Spanish land grant known as the Rancho Rosa Castilla, created by the family of Juan Batista Batz, a <a href="Basque_people" title="wikilink">Basque</a> rancher from northern <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> who settled here in the 1850s. The inspiration for the name of the rancho, according to local historians, was the wild rose that once grew near the ranch home.</p>
<p>CSULA was founded in <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a> by an act of the California <a href="legislature" class="uri" title="wikilink">legislature</a> and opened for classes on the campus of <a href="Los_Angeles_City_College" title="wikilink">Los Angeles City College</a>, itself the former location of <a href="UCLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">UCLA</a>, as the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences. P. Victor Peterson was LACC's first president. The shared-campus experiment proved to be unwieldy and the school moved to its present location in <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a> the school was renamed California State College at Los Angeles (CSCLA) when it became part of the California State College (CSC) system. In <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>, CSCLA was awarded University status and was renamed the California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA).</p>

The first student newspaper, at that time called <em>The College Times</em>, was published in June 1948 for the first time.

<p>In January 2007, <em>The University Times</em> changed its publication schedule from a twice weekly paper to a weekly paper, publishing on Tuesdays. The format change to a style similar to the alternative newspaper, LA Weekly, allowed for a greater number of pages to run and allow more in-depth coverage of news stories relevant to the student body and surrounding community.</p>
<p>During the Summer of 2007, the University Times underwent a transition period as the paper started a merger process with its new online presence, Cool State.
