<p><strong>Alyssa Jean Healy</strong> (born 24 March 1990 on the <a href="Gold_Coast,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Gold Coast</a>, <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>) is a <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who plays for <a href="New_South_Wales_Breakers" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and the <a href="Australia_national_women&#39;s_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australian women's team</a>. She made her international debut in February 2010.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A right-handed <a href="batsman" class="uri" title="wikilink">batsman</a> and <a href="wicket-keeper" class="uri" title="wikilink">wicket-keeper</a>, she is the daughter of Greg Healy, who was part of the <a href="Queensland_Bulls" title="wikilink">Queensland squad</a>, while her uncle <a href="Ian_Healy" title="wikilink">Ian Healy</a> was Australia's <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test</a> wicket-keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals. Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools' competition in New South Wales. She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 2007–08 season. She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of <a href="Leonie_Coleman" title="wikilink">Leonie Coleman</a>—a wicket-keeper for Australia—in the state side. Coleman left New South Wales at the start of the 2009–10 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full-time basis for her state. During the same season, she recorded her highest score of 89 <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">not out</a> as <a href="run_rate" title="wikilink">faster than a run a ball</a>, and made the most dismissals of any wicket-keeper in the <a href="Women&#39;s_National_Cricket_League" title="wikilink">Women's National Cricket League</a>.</p>
<p>Following the injury to Australian captain and wicket-keeper <a href="Jodie_Fields" title="wikilink">Jodie Fields</a>, Healy was given her international debut in the 2010 Rose Bowl series against <a href="New_Zealand_national_women&#39;s_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>. She played in the first five <a href="One_Day_Internationals" title="wikilink">One Day Internationals</a> (ODIs) and five <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> (T20) internationals, but was dropped for the last three ODIs during the New Zealand leg of the series. Healy played in every match of the <a href="2010_ICC_Women&#39;s_World_Twenty20" title="wikilink">2010 World Twenty20</a> as Australia won the tournament after an unbeaten campaign.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Healy is the daughter of Greg, who was a member of the <a href="Queensland_Bulls" title="wikilink">Queensland squad</a>, while Greg's younger brother <a href="Ian_Healy" title="wikilink">Ian</a> was Australia's <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test</a> wicket-keeper from the late 1980s until 1999 and was the world record holder for the most Test dismissals.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Another uncle, <a href="Ken_Healy" title="wikilink">Ken</a>, played for Queensland.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Despite the family heritage, and watching her uncle represent Australia, she said that she did not become interested in cricket until she moved from <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> to <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> as a child and was coaxed into taking up the sport by a friend.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Her selection at the age of 16 in late 2006 as <a href="wicket-keeper" class="uri" title="wikilink">wicket-keeper</a> for <a href="Barker_College" title="wikilink">Barker College</a> <a href="11_(number)#In_sports" title="wikilink">First XI</a>, the first time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools' cricket competition in <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, drew press commentary from various sources. This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled &quot;Save Barker Cricket Now&quot; in the school community attacking the selection as a &quot;disgrace&quot; and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as &quot;gutless&quot; and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Ian Healy and <a href="Alex_Blackwell" title="wikilink">Alex Blackwell</a>, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 2010, she reflected &quot;I'd do it all again...I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped lift my skills and tighten my technique.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Both she and Australian team-mate <a href="Ellyse_Perry" title="wikilink">Ellyse Perry</a> have publicly advocated girls playing against boys.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2007, Healy was selected in the New South Wales team to play in the Under-19 interstate competition. Opening the batting in all three matches and keeping in only the second of these, she scored 47, 73 and 41 in her first three three matches, and took one <a href="catch_(cricket)" title="wikilink">catch</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> She went on to end with 345 <a href="run_(cricket)" title="wikilink">runs</a> at a <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> of 57.50, topping the run-scorers list and was named the best under-17 player at the tournament.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The following month, she was selected in the Australia Youth team, composed of under-23 cricketers, to play against New Zealand A, the only player selected before making their senior domestic debut.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She scored 10 not out, 41 and 63 in three matches, and made one stumping.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Her 63 from 84 balls in the final match was the top-score for the Australians, but it was not enough to prevent a 22-run defeat.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She played as a wicket-keeper batting in the middle-order in the first match, and opened in the last two matches, playing purely as a batsman.

<h2 id="senior-domestic-debut">Senior domestic debut</h2>
<p>At the start of the 2007–08 season, she made her senior debut for the <a href="New_South_Wales_Breakers" title="wikilink">New South Wales Breakers</a> in the Australian domestic one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">top-order</a>, as <a href="Leonie_Coleman" title="wikilink">Leonie Coleman</a>, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against <a href="South_Australian_Scorpions" title="wikilink">South Australia</a> and was unsuccessful to being with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five <a href="innings" class="uri" title="wikilink">innings</a>. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After <a href="Queensland_Fire" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 <a href="over_(cricket)" title="wikilink">overs</a>, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the <a href="run_rate" title="wikilink">run rate</a>, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight <a href="four_(cricket)" title="wikilink">fours</a>, shepherding the <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">tail-enders</a> and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>New South Wales reached the final and were awarded the title because they placed first in the qualifying matches after rain washed out the deciding game.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Healy ended the season with 78 runs at 11.14.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> She also played in two <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> interstate matches. She scored two and made a <a href="stumping" class="uri" title="wikilink">stumping</a> in the first match, and neither batted nor kept wicket in the latter. New South Wales prevailed in both.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of the season, she was selected for the Under-23 Australian team to play a series against the senior <a href="England_women&#39;s_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> and Australian teams. She scored 45, 1 and 41 not out in three matches. In the third match, she combined for a second-wicket <a href="partnership_(cricket)" title="wikilink">partnership</a> of 52 with <a href="Elyse_Villani" title="wikilink">Elyse Villani</a>, hitting six boundaries in 62 balls and guiding her team to an eight-wicket win over the Australian team.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Playing as a specialist batsman, she also took three catches.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The new 2008–09 season started the same way, with the Under-23 national team playing against Australia and <a href="India_national_women&#39;s_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a>. The first match, against India, was washed out and Healy made a <a href="Duck_(cricket)" title="wikilink">duck</a> [zero] and 9 in the other matches. Playing as a batsman, she did not take a catch.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Healy again played as a batsman, with Coleman ensconced behind the stumps. In the first four matches of the new domestic season, she batted only once, scoring nine. In these matches she was placed in the lower-order and did not bowl. She was dropped after these four matches.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>She then played six matches for the Second XI in the space of a week, mostly as a top-order batsman, sometimes opening and as a wicket-keeper. New South Wales won all the fixtures except for one that was abandoned due to inclement weather.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> She scored 120 runs at 40.00, took six catches and made three stumpings, and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second-string outfit.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In her first three matches back, Healy was placed in the middle-order and not required to bat or keep wickets.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In the last league match, she scored 59 from 55 balls in a 89-run partnership at faster than a run a ball with <a href="Lisa_Sthalekar" title="wikilink">Lisa Sthalekar</a> against <a href="Victorian_Spirit" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. New South Wales won by three wickets despite losing Healy and three subsequent batsmen in the closing phase of the run-chase.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the final against the same team the following week, Healy made 11 from 22 balls before being <a href="run_out" title="wikilink">run out</a>, but New South Wales nevertheless won by six wickets with more than 15 overs to spare to claim the title.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Healy ended the one-day competition with 79 runs at 26.33.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> She was named Australia's 30-strong shortlist for the <a href="2009_Women&#39;s_Cricket_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2009 Women's Cricket World Cup</a>, but was not a part of the final squad of 15.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Healy also played in two <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> matches for her state during the season, scoring 35 from 27 balls against South Australia and 16 from 21 balls against Victoria.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> She was New South Wales' second top-scorer in both matches; the first was won but the second lost.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

After making scores of 11, 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one-day season,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria. Coming in upon the fall of <a href="Leah_Poulton" title="wikilink">Leah Poulton</a> with the score at 1/9 after three overs, she hit 13 fours in 82 balls, putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar. New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match, having earlier taken a <a href="Caught" title="wikilink">catch</a> and made a stumping.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under-21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players.

<p>In the final of the one-day competition, she scored 23 from 37 balls batting at No. 3 and took two catches as New South Wales defeated Victoria by 59 runs.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Healy ended her first full season as a wicket-keeper with 208 runs at 29.71, the second-highest average in her team behind Blackwell.

The selection committee released a statement saying &quot;Alyssa has been identified for higher honours for a number of years and now gets the chance to display her wicket-keeping skills and attacking batting on the international stage&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Healy made her ODI debut at the <a href="Adelaide_Oval" title="wikilink">Adelaide Oval</a> and played in all five ODIs in the Australian leg of the series. In her first match, she scored 21 from 11 balls in the death overs, hitting four fours as Australia made 241 before bowling out the visitors for 126 to seal a 115-run win. She took one catch, removing <a href="Amy_Satterthwaite" title="wikilink">Amy Satterthwaite</a> from the bowling of <a href="Rene_Farrell" title="wikilink">Rene Farrell</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Healy made consecutive ducks in the next two matches, and made four in the final match at <a href="Junction_Oval" title="wikilink">Junction Oval</a>.

<p>She then played in the three T20s held at <a href="Bellerive_Oval" title="wikilink">Bellerive Oval</a> in <a href="Hobart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hobart</a>. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the <a href="Australia_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies</a> men teams, and was the first match to be shown live on free-to-air television in Australia.

Healy came to the crease at 6/107 at the end of the 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant <a href="fielding_(cricket)" title="wikilink">first slip area</a>. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper <a href="Rachel_Priest" title="wikilink">Rachel Priest</a> diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss <a href="Danielle_Hazell" title="wikilink">Danielle Hazell</a> from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were struggling when Healy came to the crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen in the space of 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory.

<p>A Super Over eventuated, and <a href="Laura_Marsh" title="wikilink">Laura Marsh</a> bowled for England. Healy came in at 1/3 after <a href="Leah_Poulton" title="wikilink">Leah Poulton</a> fell on the fourth ball. She hit a two from the fifth ball, and was run out by <a href="Jenny_Gunn" title="wikilink">Jenny Gunn</a> while attempting to complete a second run on the sixth and final ball of Australia's Super Over, leaving them at 2/6. England also ended with 2/6 after a run out in an attempt to secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more <a href="six_(cricket)" title="wikilink">sixes</a> in the match—<a href="Jess_Cameron" title="wikilink">Jess Cameron</a> scored the solitary six.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>In the next match against South Africa, Healy was elevated two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon the fall of Cameron, her partner <a href="Sarah_Elliott" title="wikilink">Sarah Elliott</a> was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal was part of a sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133.
