<p>Youngstown was named for New York native <a href="John_Young_(pioneer)" title="wikilink">John Young</a>, who surveyed the area in 1796 and settled there soon after.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On February 9, 1797, Young purchased the township of 15,560 acres (63 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) from the <a href="Connecticut_Western_Reserve" title="wikilink">Western Reserve Land Company</a> for $16,085.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The 1797 establishment of Youngstown was officially recorded on August 19, 1802.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The area constituting present-day Youngstown was part of the <a href="Connecticut_Western_Reserve" title="wikilink">Connecticut Western Reserve</a>, a section of the <a href="Northwest_Territory" title="wikilink">Northwest Territory</a> reserved for settlers from the state of <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While many of the area's early settlers came from Connecticut, Youngstown attracted a significant number of <a href="Scots-Irish_American" title="wikilink">Scots-Irish</a> settlers from neighboring <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The first European Americans to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near the point where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>As the Western Reserve's population grew, the need for administrative districts became apparent. In 1800, territorial governor <a href="Arthur_St._Clair" title="wikilink">Arthur St. Clair</a> established Trumbull County (named in honor of Connecticut Governor <a href="Jonathan_Trumbull" title="wikilink">Jonathan Trumbull</a>), and designated the smaller settlement of Warren as its administrative center, or &quot;<a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1813, Trumbull County was divided into townships, with Youngstown Township comprising much of what became Mahoning County.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The village of Youngstown was incorporated in 1848, and in 1867 Youngstown was chartered as a city. It became the county seat in 1876, when the administrative center of Mahoning County was moved from neighboring <a href="Canfield,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Canfield</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The discovery of coal by the community in the early 1800s paved the way for the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed <a href="Erie_Canal" title="wikilink">Erie Canal</a>. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Local industrialist <a href="David_Tod" title="wikilink">David Tod</a>, who was later Ohio governor during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>, persuaded <a href="Lake_Erie" title="wikilink">Lake Erie</a> steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>, Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>, Italy, and Greece.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, and <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a> activity.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and <a href="Italian_American" title="wikilink">Italian</a> and <a href="Irish_American" title="wikilink">Irish</a> Americans in neighboring <a href="Niles,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Niles</a> led Ohio Governor <a href="A._Victor_Donahey" title="wikilink">A.

<p>The growth of industry attracted people from within the borders of the United States, and from <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a>. By the late 19th century, <a href="African_Americans" title="wikilink">African Americans</a> were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the <a href="African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church" title="wikilink">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> was established in 1871.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the 1880s, local attorney <a href="William_R._Stewart" title="wikilink">William R.

During the national <a href="Steel_Strike_of_1919" title="wikilink">Steel Strike of 1919</a>, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">South</a>, many of whom were Black.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative <a href="sharecropping" class="uri" title="wikilink">sharecropping</a> system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>According to the 2000 Census numbers, Youngstown has 32,177 households and 19,724 families in the city. The population density is 893/km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (2,312.9/sq mi). There are 37,159 housing units at an average density of 1,096.3/sq mi (423.2/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The racial makeup of the city is roughly 51% White, 44% Black or African American, and 5% <a href="Hispanic_(U.S._Census)" title="wikilink">Hispanic</a> or Latino of any race, though <a href="Puerto_Rican_American" title="wikilink">Puerto Ricans</a> are the dominant Latino group.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Records suggest that 27.2% of the households have children under the age of 18. Of these, 33.2% are married couples living together, 22.9% have a female householder with no husband present, and 38.7% are non-families. Meanwhile, 34.0% of all households comprise a single person, and 14.7% of households comprise a person over 65 years of age living alone. The average household size is 2.39 and the average family size is 3.07.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In Youngstown, the population leans toward greater numbers of youths, as is often the case in U.S. inner-city areas with higher <a href="birth_rates" title="wikilink">birth rates</a>. Survey data show the following: 25.8% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 36 years.

<p><img src="sheet&amp;tube.jpg" title="fig:Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube and Viaduct" alt="Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube and Viaduct" /> Endowed with large deposits of coal and iron as well as &quot;old growth&quot; hardwood forests needed to produce charcoal, the Youngstown area eventually developed a thriving steel industry. The area's first blast furnace was established to the east of town in 1803 by James and Daniel Heaton.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In time, the availability of fossil fuels contributed to the development of other coal-fired mills, including the Youngstown Rolling Mill Company, which was established in 1846.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> By the mid-19th century, Youngstown was the site of several iron industrial plants, notably David Tod's <a href="Brier_Hill" title="wikilink">Brier Hill</a> Iron &amp; Coal Company.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The iron industry continued to expand in the 1890s, despite the depletion of local natural resources.

<p>At the turn of the century, local industrialists began to convert to steel manufacturing, amid a wave of industrial consolidations that placed much of the Mahoning Valley's industry in the hands of national corporations.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Shortly after the establishment of <a href="U.S._Steel" title="wikilink">U.S. Steel</a> in 1901, the corporate entity absorbed Youngstown's premier steel producer, the National Steel Company.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> One year earlier, however, a group of city investors took steps to ensure high levels of local ownership in the area's industrial sector.

<p>In the late 1930s, the community's steel sector gained national attention once again, when Youngstown became a site of the so-called &quot;Little Steel Strike&quot;, an effort by the <a href="Steel_Workers_Organizing_Committee" title="wikilink">Steel Workers Organizing Committee</a>, a precursor to <a href="United_Steelworkers" title="wikilink">United Steelworkers</a>, to secure contract agreements with smaller steel companies.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> These firms included <a href="Republic_Steel" title="wikilink">Republic Steel</a>, Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, <a href="National_Steel_Corporation" title="wikilink">National Steel</a>, <a href="Inland_Steel_Company" title="wikilink">Inland Steel</a>, and <a href="American_Rolling_Mills" title="wikilink">American Rolling Mills</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="Gus_Hall" title="wikilink">Gus Hall</a>, one of the committee's founding organizers, led strikes in Youngstown and Warren.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On June 21, 1937, strike-related violence in Youngstown resulted in two deaths and 42 injuries.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite violent episodes in Youngstown and Chicago, the Little Steel Strike proved to be a turning point in the history of the U.S. <a href="Labour_movement" title="wikilink">labor movement</a>.

<p>Between the 1920s and 1960s, the city was known as an important industrial hub that featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became economically diversified, as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives. The 1969 corporate merger between the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company and the <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>-based Lykes Corporation proved to be a turning point in the demise of the local steel industry.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The merger and subsequent takeover of Youngstown Sheet and Tube burdened the community's primary steel producer with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Further, the deal placed control of the company outside of the Mahoning Valley.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The September 19, 1977, announcement of the closure of a large portion of <a href="Youngstown_Sheet_and_Tube" title="wikilink">Youngstown Sheet and Tube</a>, an event still remembered by many Youngstowners as &quot;Black Monday&quot;, is widely regarded as the death knell of the old area steel industry.

<p>Youngstown is the site of several steel and metalworking operations, though nothing on the scale seen during the &quot;glory days&quot; of the &quot;Steel Valley&quot;. The largest employer in the city is <a href="Youngstown_State_University" title="wikilink">Youngstown State University</a> (YSU), an urban public campus that serves about 13,000 students, located just north of downtown.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>The blow dealt to the community's industrial economy in the 1970s, was slightly mitigated by the presence of auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the <a href="Studebaker_Avanti" title="wikilink">Avanti</a>, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by <a href="Studebaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Studebaker</a> to compete with the <a href="Corvette" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corvette</a>, was manufactured in an industrial complex located on Youngstown's Albert Street. However, this company didn't last long in Youngstown, moving after just a few years.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> A mainstay, though, of Youngstown's industrial economy has long been the GM Lordstown plant.The <a href="General_Motors_Corporation" title="wikilink">General Motors</a>' <a href="Lordstown_Assembly" title="wikilink">Lordstown Assembly</a> plant is the largest industrial employer is the area.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and <a href="Cavalier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cavalier</a>.

<p><a href="Delphi_Corporation" title="wikilink">Delphi</a>, Packard Electric Systems, and the WCI Steel plant are also located in the Warren area. The largest industrial employers within the Youngstown city limits are V&amp;M Star Steel Company (formerly North Star Steel), in the Brier Hill district, and Exal Corporation, located on Poland Avenue. The latter has recently expanded its operations.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="new-growth">New growth</h3>
<p><img src="Youngstown003.jpg" title="fig:Downtown Youngstown at night" alt="Downtown Youngstown at night" /> Youngstown's downtown, which once underscored the community's economic difficulties, is a site of new business growth. The <a href="business_incubator" title="wikilink">Youngstown Business Incubator</a>, located in the heart of the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies, which have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company&lt;U+2013&gt;Turning Technologies&lt;U+2013&gt;has been rated by <em>Inc. Magazine</em> as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the incubator secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion.

<h3 id="legacy-of-innovation">Legacy of innovation</h3>
<p>Extensive coverage of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number of products and enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based <a href="Schwebel&#39;s_Bakery" title="wikilink">Schwebel's Bakery</a>, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 1900s. The company now distributes bread products nationally.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In the 1920s, Youngstown was the birthplace of the <a href="Good_Humor" title="wikilink">Good Humor</a> brand of ice cream novelties,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> and the popular franchise of <a href="Handel&#39;s_Homemade_Ice_Cream_&amp;_Yogurt" title="wikilink">Handel's Homemade Ice Cream &amp; Yogurt</a> was established there in the 1940s.

<h3 id="post-steel-image-in-popular-culture">Post-steel image in popular culture</h3>
<p>A large segment of the American public associates Youngstown with the economic malaise that befell much of the industrial northeast after the collapse of its manufacturing sector. The decline of Youngstown's steel industry and its adverse effects on local workers were the subjects of <a href="Bruce_Springsteen" title="wikilink">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s ballad, &quot;<a href="Youngstown_(song)" title="wikilink">Youngstown</a>&quot;, featured on his <em><a href="The_Ghost_of_Tom_Joad" title="wikilink">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a></em> album.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> In the lyric, Springsteen addresses &quot;my sweet Jenny,&quot; a reference to the Jeanette Blast Furnace, owned by Youngstown Sheet And Tube Company, which sat along the <a href="Mahoning_River" title="wikilink">Mahoning River</a> in the Brier Hill area of the city and was dynamited in 1977. Springsteen made Youngstown the first stop on his solo <a href="Ghost_of_Tom_Joad_Tour" title="wikilink">Ghost of Tom Joad Tour</a>, playing to a sold-out audience at <a href="Stambaugh_Auditorium" title="wikilink">Stambaugh Auditorium</a> on January 12, 1996.</p>
<p>Another pop culture reference to Youngstown came via the HBO television show <a href="The_Sopranos" title="wikilink">The Sopranos</a> in 2002. In the show's fourth season premiere episode, entitled &quot;<a href="For_All_Debts_Public_and_Private" title="wikilink">For All Debts Public and Private</a>&quot;, the character <a href="Paulie_Gualtieri" title="wikilink">Paulie Gualtieri</a> is imprisoned in Youngstown for possessing a weapon that was used in an unsolved Youngstown murder. This episode's use of Youngstown as a setting seems to reference the city's association with crime and mob-related violence.</p>
<h2 id="government">Government</h2>
<p>Youngstown is governed by a <a href="List_of_mayors_of_Youngstown,_Ohio" title="wikilink">mayor</a> who is elected every four years and limited to a maximum of two terms. Mayors are traditionally inaugurated on or around the second of January. The city has tended to elect <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> mayors since the late 1920s because of the local unions' support for Democratic candidates for office.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Youngstown's current mayor is <a href="Jay_Williams_(politician)" title="wikilink">Jay Williams</a>, the city's first African-American mayor and its first <a href="Independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">independent</a> mayor since 1922.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Williams belongs to the <a href="Mayors_Against_Illegal_Guns_Coalition" title="wikilink">Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition</a>,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> a bi-partisan group with the stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Residents elect an eight-member city council, which includes representatives of the city's seven wards and a council president. The council, in turn, appoints a city clerk. The council traditionally meets every first and third Wednesday of the month. City council meetings are generally held from the third week in September to the third week in June. Meanwhile, the board of control oversees contracts for public projects within the municipal limits. The Youngstown Police Department and <a href="Youngstown_Fire_Department" title="wikilink">Youngstown Fire Department</a> fall under the board's supervision, as do the parks, civil service, community development, health, planning, and water departments.</p>
<p>Youngstown's finance department oversees all municipal finances and supervises the departments of economic development and income tax. The city's department of public works has sweeping supervisory responsibilities and oversees the departments of engineering, building inspection, building and grounds, signal and sign, demolition and housing, litter and recycling, street, and water waste treatment. The city's law department represents the city on all legal issues, serving as counsel to all municipal departments.</p>

<p>The <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Youngstown" title="wikilink">Diocese of Youngstown</a> once oversaw more than 20 schools within the city limits.

<p>In early 2007, the &quot;Championship Wrestling Experience&quot; began holding events in the area that featured stars like &quot;Jake the Snake&quot; Roberts and Jerry Lynn. These wrestlers have appeared at the &quot;Salute to Wrestling&quot; event held in July for the <a href="Mahoning_Valley_Scrappers" title="wikilink">Mahoning Valley Scrappers</a>.</p>
<p>The community has a lengthy tradition of collegiate sports. The Youngstown State University Penguins, a major regional draw, compete in the <a href="Missouri_Valley_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">Missouri Valley Football Conference</a>. The Penguins, noted participants in FCS (I-AA) football, play their games at <a href="Stambaugh_Stadium" title="wikilink">Stambaugh Stadium</a> and enjoy one of the more supportive fan bases. All other YSU athletic teams compete in the <a href="Horizon_League" title="wikilink">Horizon League</a>. The Youngstown State men and women's basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State's <a href="Beeghly_Center" title="wikilink">Beeghly Center</a>. The teams average about 2,500 fans per game, a number which has been on the rise the past two seasons with a new style of play under Head Coach Jerry Slocum. In addition, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed local support and success. The baseball team reached the NCAA super-regionals in 2005, and the softball team did so in 2006.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="building-on-tradition">Building on tradition</h3>
<p>One of the city's most recent sports-related attractions is the <a href="Covelli_Centre" title="wikilink">Covelli Centre</a> (formerly the Chevrolet Center and during planning the Youngstown Convocation Center), which was funded primarily through a $26 million federal grant. Located on the site of an abandoned steel mill, the large, high-tech facility opened in October 2005.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The Centre's main tenants are the <a href="Youngstown_Phantoms" title="wikilink">Youngstown Phantoms</a>, which play in the <a href="United_States_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">United States Hockey League</a>, and the Mahoning Valley Thunder, an af2 arena football team which began play in 2007. Previously, it was home to the Youngstown Steelhounds hockey team, who played in the <a href="Central_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">CHL</a>. The city plans to develop vacant land adjacent to the Centre. Plans included using the space for a park, riverwalk (the Mahoning River flows through the site), amphitheater, or athletic stadium for the city's public and private high schools.</p>
<p>Such investments reflect wide appreciation of Youngstown's athletic tradition, which has produced noted figures in a variety of sports. Prominent athletes with connections to the city include former world boxing champions Greg Richardson, <a href="International_Boxing_Federation" title="wikilink">IBF</a> <a href="lightweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">lightweight</a> champion Harry Arroyo,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> <a href="College_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">College Football Hall of Fame</a> <a href="End_(football)" title="wikilink">end</a> <a href="Bob_Dove" title="wikilink">Bob Dove</a>,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hall of Fame</a> umpire <a href="Billy_Evans" title="wikilink">Billy Evans</a>,<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> major league <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> <a href="Dave_Dravecky" title="wikilink">Dave Dravecky</a>,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">NFL</a> <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Bernie_Kosar" title="wikilink">Bernie Kosar</a>,<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> <a href="IBF" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBF</a> cruiserweight champion Jeff Lampkin,<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> <a href="World_Boxing_Association" title="wikilink">WBA</a> lightweight champion Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> major league manager <a href="Jimmy_McAleer" title="wikilink">Jimmy McAleer</a>,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> <a href="World_Boxing_Council" title="wikilink">WBC</a> and <a href="WBO" class="uri" title="wikilink">WBO</a> middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik,<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> legendary baseball trainer <a href="Bonesetter_Reese" title="wikilink">&quot;Bonesetter&quot; Reese</a>,<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> major league <a href="outfielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">outfielder</a> <a href="George_Shuba" title="wikilink">George Shuba</a>,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> and <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> recipient <a href="Frank_Sinkwich" title="wikilink">Frank Sinkwich</a>.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="former-attractions">Former attractions</h3>
<p>Several of the city's recreational resources disappeared amid the economic hardships that began in the late 1970s. Among these was <em><a href="Idora_Park,_Youngstown" title="wikilink">Idora Park</a>,</em> an amusement park that served as a convenient alternative for residents who preferred not to travel to larger parks in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> (These included <em><a href="Conneaut_Lake_Park" title="wikilink">Conneaut Lake Park</a></em> in <a href="Conneaut_Lake,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania</a>, <em><a href="Geauga_Lake" title="wikilink">Geauga Lake</a></em> in <a href="Aurora,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Aurora, Ohio</a>, <em><a href="Cedar_Point" title="wikilink">Cedar Point</a></em> in <a href="Sandusky,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Sandusky, Ohio</a>, and <em><a href="Kennywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kennywood</a></em> in <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>.) The park, which closed in 1984, held sentimental value for many local residents and enjoyed a degree of historical significance. Former Youngstown resident <a href="Jack_Warner" title="wikilink">Jack Warner</a> noted in his autobiography that the <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner brothers</a> took their first step into the movie business when they screened a used copy of <em><a href="The_Great_Train_Robbery_(1903_film)" title="wikilink">The Great Train Robbery</a></em> at <em>Idora Park</em> and other local venues.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>From the early 1900s to the mid-1970s, Youngstown was the retail center of the Mahoning Valley. There were two flagship department stores in the downtown area, including <a href="Strouss" title="wikilink">Strouss Hirshberg's</a> (later absorbed by <a href="Kaufmann&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaufmann's</a>, now part of <a href="Macy&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macy's</a>) and <a href="McKelvey&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">McKelvey's</a> (later <a href="Higbee&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Higbee's</a>, now part of <a href="Dillard&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dillard's</a>). Specialty shops lined the main artery of West Federal Street, and the district had four upscale <a href="movie_theater" title="wikilink">movie theaters</a>, including the Palace Theater, the Warner Brothers' first Theater, the State Theater, and the Paramount Theater. These businesses were the first to close as a result of declining attendance in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, the appearance of two suburban malls (the <a href="Southern_Park_Mall" title="wikilink">Southern Park Mall</a>, in Boardman, and the <a href="Eastwood_Mall_(Niles)" title="wikilink">Eastwood Mall</a>, in Niles) hastened the closure or relocation of many businesses that remained. The collapse of the community's steel industry at the end of the decade created additional challenges for downtown business owners; and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, efforts to revive the former retail hub were unsuccessful.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="redevelopment">Redevelopment</h2>
<p><img src="Youngstown1_003.jpg" title="fig:The George Voinovich Center (left) and Mahoning County Children&#39;s Services Center (right)" alt="The George Voinovich Center (left) and Mahoning County Children&#39;s Services Center (right)" /> Youngstown's cityscape includes relatively few contemporary buildings, and from certain angles, the downtown area appears to have changed little since the 1960s. Yet, downtown Youngstown has seen modest levels of new construction. Recent additions include the <a href="George_Voinovich" title="wikilink">George Voinovich</a> Government Center and state and federal courthouses: the Seventh District Court of Appeals and the <a href="Nathaniel_R._Jones" title="wikilink">Nathaniel R. Jones</a> Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. The latter features an award-winning design by the architectural firm, <a href="Robert_A._M._Stern" title="wikilink">Robert A. M. Stern Architects</a>.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, Federal Street, a major downtown thoroughfare that was closed off to create a pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction-and-business-development">Construction and business development</h3>
<p><img src="Youngstown1_002.jpg" title="fig:The re-opened Federal Street" alt="The re-opened Federal Street" /> In 2004, construction began on a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and a grant from the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development" title="wikilink">United States Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million <a href="New_Urbanist" title="wikilink">New Urbanist</a> revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Construction for the project began in 2006.</p>
<p>New construction has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. One of the area's more successful business ventures in recent years has been the Youngstown Business Incubator. This nonprofit organization, based in a former downtown department store building, fosters the growth of fledgling technology-based companies. The incubator, which boasts more than a dozen business tenants, has recently completed construction on the Taft Technology Center, where some of its largest tenants will locate their offices.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crime-control">Crime control</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the city has attempted to come to terms with its troubling reputation for crime and corruption. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings that were often committed with car bombs.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Hence, the town gained the nicknames &quot;Murdertown, USA&quot; and &quot;Bomb City, USA,&quot; while the phrase &quot;Youngstown tune-up&quot; became a nationally popular slang term for car-bomb assassination.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> This dubious image has been reinforced by the widely reported fact that five prisons operate within the metropolitan area.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The city, however, has accelerated measures to limit the influence of organized crime upon all sectors of municipal life. For some observers, the climax of this ongoing effort was the arrest, trial, and 2002 conviction of former U.S. <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Representative</a> <a href="James_A._Traficant_Jr." title="wikilink">James A. Traficant, Jr.</a>, (D), on bribery, tax fraud, and racketeering charges.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Meanwhile, the municipal government has responded to a rise in gang- and drug-related violence by increasing the presence of police in urban neighborhoods. In the course of enforcing traffic laws and issuing warrants, police and state troopers have apprehended serious criminal offenders.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Despite these efforts, crime remains an area for improvement.</p>
<h3 id="renewal-plan">Renewal plan</h3>
<p>In line with these efforts to change the community's image, the city government, in partnership with the university, has organized an ambitious urban renewal plan titled Youngstown 2010. The stated goals of Youngstown 2010 include the creation of a &quot;cleaner, greener, and better planned and organized Youngstown&quot;. In January 2005, the organization unveiled its &quot;master plan&quot;, which took shape in the course of several public meetings that featured input from citizens. The plan, which received national attention, is consistent with efforts in other metropolitan areas to address the phenomenon of urban depopulation.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Given that the communities to the south and west of the city continue to enjoy a measure of economic prosperity, supporters of such projects hold out hope for the revitalization of Youngstown.</p>

<p>The Youngstown area is served by the Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA) bus system, which is supported through Mahoning County property and sales taxes. WRTA, whose main terminal is located in the downtown area, provides service throughout the city and into surrounding Mahoning and Trumbull counties.
