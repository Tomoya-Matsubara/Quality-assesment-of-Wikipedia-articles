His grandfather, also called William Parry, was headmaster of <a href="Ruthin_School" title="wikilink">Ruthin School</a> and Richards was educated there.

He then became a scholar at <a href="The_Queen&#39;s_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">The Queen's College, Oxford</a>, and after being appointed to a <a href="Oxbridge_Fellow" title="wikilink">fellowship</a> at Queen's on 17 December 1774, he was awarded his <a href="Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)" title="wikilink">Master of Arts</a> degree on 15 July 1777. In the meantime, Richards had become a member of the <a href="Inner_Temple" title="wikilink">Inner Temple</a> (being admitted on 10 May 1775) and he was <a href="called_to_the_bar" title="wikilink">called to the bar</a> on 12 February 1780.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>He was elected a <a href="Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> in February 1793 as a &quot;<em>Gentleman studious in Natural History</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>
<p>In the <a href="British_general_election,_1796" title="wikilink">1796 general election</a>, Richards was elected as one of the <a href="Members_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Members of Parliament</a> for the <a href="Helston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">constituency of Helston</a>, <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>. He held the seat until March 1799, when he resigned in favour of <a href="Francis_Osborne,_1st_Baron_Godolphin" title="wikilink">Lord Francis Osborne</a>, son of the <a href="Francis_Osborne,_5th_Duke_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">Duke of Leeds</a> who controlled the seat. He was re-elected at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1807" title="wikilink">May 1807 general election</a>, resigning on 29 July 1807 in favour of <a href="James_Blackwood,_2nd_Baron_Dufferin_and_Claneboye" title="wikilink">Sir James Blackwood</a>. During his parliamentary career, he supported the ministry of <a href="William_Pitt_the_Younger" title="wikilink">William Pitt the Younger</a> but made only one reported speech, opposing the Quakers' Relief Bill on 24 February 1797 as unnecessary and inconvenient.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legal-career">Legal career</h2>
<p>Richards' main area of practice was in the <a href="Court_of_Chancery" title="wikilink">Court of Chancery</a>. He was one of the three registrars to the <a href="Prerogative_Court" title="wikilink">Prerogative Court</a> of the <a href="Province_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Province of Canterbury</a> from 1788 to 1800, and was appointed counsel to <a href="Queen_Anne&#39;s_Bounty" title="wikilink">Queen Anne's Bounty</a> in 1789. He became solicitor-general to <a href="Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz" title="wikilink">Queen Charlotte</a> (the wife of <a href="George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King George III</a>) in 1794, becoming attorney-general to the queen in 1801 in succession to <a href="William_Grant_(British_politician)" title="wikilink">William Grant</a>. He was appointed as a <a href="Bencher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bencher</a> of Inner Temple in 1799, and held the positions of Reader (1804) and <a href="Treasurer#In_the_Inns_of_Court" title="wikilink">Treasurer</a> (1806).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>He was a potential appointee to the newly-created position of <a href="Chancellor_of_the_High_Court" title="wikilink">Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery</a> in 1812, since he was the senior chancery barrister who was not an MP, earning &lt;U+00A3&gt;7,000 per year. He was led to believe by his friend <a href="John_Scott,_1st_Earl_of_Eldon" title="wikilink">Lord Eldon</a>, the <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, that he would be appointed. However, Eldon instead bowed to party-political pressure and appointed the <a href="Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a>, <a href="Thomas_Plumer" title="wikilink">Thomas Plumer</a>, to the new post. Richards was indignant, although he was appeased by his appointment as <a href="Chief_Justice_of_Chester" title="wikilink">chief justice</a> of the <a href="county_palatine" title="wikilink">county palatine</a> of <a href="Cheshire" title="wikilink">Chester</a>. He resigned that position when he was offered a position of <a href="Exchequer_of_pleas" title="wikilink">Baron of the Exchequer</a> in February 1814. He had refused this appointment in 1807, but he was now given to understand that he would in due course succeed as <a href="Lord_Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chief Baron</a>. The offer was apparently made when Lord Eldon tossed a note into court addressed to &quot;<a href="Taffy_was_a_Welshman" title="wikilink">Taffy</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Richards was appointed a <a href="Serjeant-at-law" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serjeant-at-law</a> on 26 February 1814 and was knighted by the <a href="George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prince Regent</a> at <a href="Carlton_House,_London" title="wikilink">Carlton House</a> on 11 May 1814. On the death of <a href="Alexander_Thomson_(judge)" title="wikilink">Sir Alexander Thomson</a>, Richards became Chief Baron on 21 April 1817 and became a <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Counsellor</a> five days later. He helped clear the backlog of equity appeals and was regarded as a sound and capable judge. He presided over the trials of <a href="Jeremiah_Brandreth" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Brandreth</a>, convicted of treason, and two of the <a href="Cato_Street_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">Cato Street conspirators</a>. He also acted as <a href="Lord_Speaker" title="wikilink">Lord Speaker</a> when Lord Eldon was ill in January 1819.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>Richards married Catherine Humphreys, through whom Richards acquired an estate in <a href="Caerynwch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caerynwch</a>, Merionethshire; he later became a <a href="Deputy_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Deputy Lieutenant</a> of Merionethshire. He had eight sons and two daughters, and was known as &quot;Stumpy Dick&quot;. His eldest son <a href="Richard_Richards_(1787-1860)" title="wikilink">Richard Richards</a> (known as &quot;Double Dick&quot;) was MP for the <a href="Merioneth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">constituency of Merioneth</a> from 1836 to 1852. Robert Richards and Griffith Richards (the third and sixth sons) were both appointed <a href="Queen&#39;s_Counsel" title="wikilink">Queen's Counsel</a> and both, like their father, became benchers of Inner Temple, as did a grandson and a great-grandson of Sir Richard Richards. Richards died on 11 November 1823 and was buried in the Inner Temple vault; his wife was buried there also on 12 October 1825.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
