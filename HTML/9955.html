<p><strong><em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em></strong>, also known as <strong><em>Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez: Inside the Coup</em></strong> and <strong><em>La revoluci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n no ser&lt;U+00E1&gt; transmitida</em></strong> (Spanish title), is a 2003 documentary focusing on events in <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a> leading up to and during the <a href="2002_Venezuelan_coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat_attempt" title="wikilink">April 2002 coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat attempt</a>, which saw President <a href="Hugo_Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez" title="wikilink">Hugo Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez</a> removed from office for several days. With particular emphasis on the role played by Venezuela's private media, the film examines several key incidents: the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's ousting; the opposition's formation of an interim government headed by business leader <a href="Pedro_Carmona" title="wikilink">Pedro Carmona</a>; and the Carmona administration's collapse, which paved the way for Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's return. <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain. Given direct access to Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez, the filmmakers intended to make a <a href="Reality_television#Documentary-style" title="wikilink">fly-on-the-wall</a> biography of the president; they spent seven months filming in Venezuela, following Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens. As the coup unfolded on 11 April, Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain filmed on the streets of the capital, <a href="Caracas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracas</a>, capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence. Later, they filmed many of the political upheavals inside <a href="Miraflores_Palace" title="wikilink">Miraflores</a>, the presidential palace.</p>
<p>Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain conceived of the film after Bartley returned from documenting the aftermath of the <a href="1999_Vargas_mudslides" title="wikilink">1999 Vargas mudslides</a> for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, <a href="Bord_Scann&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_na_h&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann" title="wikilink">Bord Scann&lt;U+00E1&gt;n na h&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann</a> (BS&lt;U+00C9&gt;), for a development grant. At BS&lt;U+00C9&gt;'s request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the &lt;U+20AC&gt;200,000 production was provided by BS&lt;U+00C9&gt; and several European broadcasters. Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain shot more than 200 hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.</p>
<p>The film was positively received by mainstream film critics and won several awards. Reviewers cited the filmmakers' unprecedented proximity to key events and praised the film for its &quot;riveting narrative&quot;;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> criticism focused on its lack of context and pro-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez bias. First shown on television in Europe and Venezuela in 2003, <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> later appeared at film festivals and secured a limited theatrical release on the art house circuit. Independent activists held unofficial screenings, and Venezuelan government officials encouraged its circulation to build support for Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's administration. The film is regularly shown on Venezuelan television, and in the capital it is often broadcast during &quot;contentious political conjunctures&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> paints Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez in a favorable light, which has led to disputes over its neutrality and accuracy; particular attention is paid to its framing of the violence of 11&lt;U+2013&gt;13 April, the filmmakers' editing of the timeline, and the alleged omission of incidents and personnel. The film is alternately cited as an accurate portrayal or a misrepresentation of the events of April 2002.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Throughout much of the twentieth century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and military unrest. After <a href="Juan_Vicente_G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez" title="wikilink">Juan Vicente G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez</a>'s long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with <a href="Marcos_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez_Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez" title="wikilink">Marcos P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez</a>'s overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Until 1998, the dominant political parties were <a href="Acci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Democr&lt;U+00E1&gt;tica" title="wikilink">Acci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Democr&lt;U+00E1&gt;tica</a> and <a href="COPEI" class="uri" title="wikilink">COPEI</a>, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for Acci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Democr&lt;U+00E1&gt;tica's <a href="Carlos_Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez" title="wikilink">Carlos Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez</a>, Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the <em><a href="Caracazo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracazo</a></em> engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez strengthened his support among the poor with a series of social initiatives known as the <a href="Bolivarian_Missions" title="wikilink">Bolivarian Missions</a>, and created a network of grass-roots workers' councils, the <a href="Bolivarian_Circles" title="wikilink">Bolivarian Circles</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was &quot;embroiled ... in a severe political crisis&quot; as Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's stated policies&lt;U+2014&gt;to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest&lt;U+2014&gt;the private media was more hostile.{{#tag:ref|According to Phil Gunson in <em><a href="Columbia_Journalism_Review" title="wikilink">Columbia Journalism Review</a></em>, in Venezuela, &quot;It is hard, if not impossible, to find an impartial observer.

<p>On 11 April 2002, hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest against the government. Abandoning their planned route, the marchers advanced towards the palace, a path that took them close to government supporters who had come out in opposition to the protest. Journalist Phil Gunson wrote, &quot;Shooting broke out on all sides. A score of civilians died and more than 150 suffered gunshot wounds. The military high command called for Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez to resign, and at 3:20 the next morning they announced he had agreed to do so.

<p>Soon after the film's October 2003 broadcast on BBC Two, Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk began a campaign against <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em>, representing <em>El Gusano de Luz</em> (&quot;The Worm of Light&quot;), an organization affiliated with the Venezuelan opposition.

<p>Much of the anger about the film stemmed from its high profile internationally;<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> that it had been &quot;blessed with the imprimatur of the BBC ... with its connotations of fair and authoritative reporting&quot; only made matters worse.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> John Burns, writing in <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em>, restated many of Gunson's arguments,<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> and the BBC received 4,000 e-mails demanding that <em>Storyville</em>{{'}}s commissioning editor, Nick Fraser, be sacked.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Toward the end of 2003, the weight of criticism forced the BBC to act.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> The corporation's complaints unit opened an investigation, and Fraser said the BBC would not show the film again until it had concluded. He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out-of-chronology footage, saying the latter was &quot;a real problem&lt;U+2014&gt;particularly ... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> The furore came at a difficult time for the corporation, which was under the spotlight of the <a href="Hutton_Inquiry" title="wikilink">Hutton Inquiry</a>, the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of <a href="David_Kelly_(weapons_expert)" title="wikilink">David Kelly</a>; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been &quot;sexed up&quot; by the UK government to justify the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="responsibility-for-violence">Responsibility for violence</h3>
<p>One of the film's key contentions is that the private media aired footage selectively to make it look like the violence of 11 April was caused by Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters, portraying them as an &quot;irrational and uncivilized mob&quot;.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Private television repeatedly showed Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters on Puente Llaguno bridge as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that &quot;the opposition march had never taken that route&quot; and that Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters were only returning fire.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, pointing out that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that &quot;coup plotters&quot; were the shooters.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> In response, the filmmakers say, &quot;Nowhere in the film did we say that only [Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters] were shot ... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings.&quot;<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an &quot;analysis of the shadows&quot; by Schalk,<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> who created a counter-documentary, <em><a href="X-Ray_of_a_Lie" title="wikilink">X-Ray of a Lie</a></em>, to examine <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> &quot;scene by scene to uncover [its] narrative strategies and use of artifice&quot;.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Brian A. Nelson, in his book <em>The Silence and the Scorpion</em>, agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers &quot;put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there&quot;.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements&lt;U+2014&gt;including one from <em><a href="Le_Monde" title="wikilink">Le Monde Diplomatique</a></em>{{'}}s deputy editor&lt;U+2014&gt;and an Australian documentary, <em>Anatomy of a Coup</em>, that &quot;came to conclusions similar to our own&quot;.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> A Venezuelan documentary, <em><a href="Puente_Llaguno:_Claves_de_una_Masacre" title="wikilink">Puente Llaguno: Claves de una Masacre</a></em>, also supported Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain's view.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="timeline-and-media-depictions">Timeline and media depictions</h3>
<p>Other issues of contention include the lack of historical context; the film does not cover some of the events leading up to Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered &quot;how to defend themselves against possible ... attacks&quot; from Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held &quot;long before&quot; the events of April 2002.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor <a href="Freddy_Bernal" title="wikilink">Freddy Bernal</a> as he sings to a happy group of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a &quot;differently dressed Bernal&quot; reveal that the footage was from another day.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, &quot;The opposition march was entirely peaceful.&quot;<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> The film presents footage of its &quot;violent finale&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;including an image from another day&lt;U+2014&gt;as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that &quot;some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight&quot;.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain admit that they included a &quot;limited&quot; amount of archive footage,<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> but say it was a &quot;legitimate reconstruction&quot;<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> to build context &quot;before the core narrative of the coup [took] off&quot; as they &quot;could not be everywhere filming at all times&quot;.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> claims that state television was &quot;the only channel to which [Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez] had access&quot;, but does not mention that during the violence he requisitioned &quot;all radio and TV frequencies&quot; to broadcast his two-hour address.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen, showing Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's address on one side and footage of the violence on the other.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez subsequently took television stations <a href="RCTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">RCTV</a> and <a href="Venevisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venevisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> off the air.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> The film's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition &quot;plotters&quot; is also disputed; according to <em>X-Ray of a Lie</em> and Gunson, staff left willingly.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a><a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV's signal being cut&lt;U+2014&gt;mid-interview with a government legislator&lt;U+2014&gt;was fabricated.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain say they witnessed ministers' being unable to broadcast and that the <a href="International_Federation_of_Journalists" title="wikilink">International Federation of Journalists</a> corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace, which Gunson says were there at the request of the president, not the opposition. He also challenges the film for presenting Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters as &quot;invariably poor, brown-skinned, and cheerful&quot; and the opposition as &quot;rich, white, racist, and violent&quot;.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters &quot;made the center of Caracas a no-go area&quot;.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Bartley and &lt;U+00D3&gt; Briain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's supporters &quot;were broadly poor and dark-skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class&quot;, including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in <em><a href="The_Christian_Science_Monitor" title="wikilink">The Christian Science Monitor</a></em>.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media &quot;behaved disgracefully&quot; by &quot;systematically [excluding the pro-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez] viewpoint from print, radio, and TV&quot; during the period of the coup.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="military-involvement">Military involvement</h3>
<p>Of greater concern, Gunson says, is the &quot;deliberate blurring of responsibility for the coup&quot;.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, &quot;leaving a total power vacuum&quot;.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> However, the high command's senior figure, General <a href="Lucas_Rinc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Romero" title="wikilink">Lucas Rinc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> (who announced Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's resignation on television), was not part of the coup and remained in the government after April 2002.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> The petition draws the conclusion, &quot;(1) either General Rinc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country ... or (2) General Rinc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n lied, because he was an accomplice ... that seems not to be the truth because he [remained in Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's administration].&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support.

<p>Frank Scheck, writing in <em><a href="The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>, said the film presented an enthralling story that &quot;resembles a taut ... political thriller&quot;,<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> and <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> in the <em><a href="Chicago_Sun-Times" title="wikilink">Chicago Sun-Times</a></em> called it a &quot;remarkable documentary&quot; full of &quot;astonishing shots&quot;.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a><a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Ebert reserved criticism for the film's partiality, particularly the selective way in which Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's opponents were framed,<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's &quot;brevity and succinctness&quot;.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> In <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em>, Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a &quot;superior example of fearless filmmakers in exactly the right place at the right time&quot;, and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> He had praise for the camera work and editing, and said the film was a &quot;startling record&quot; that reached &quot;another level&quot; when events shifted to the presidential palace.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> He cited these scenes&lt;U+2014&gt;along with those of the protesters' clashing&lt;U+2014&gt;as ones that &quot;spark with a vibrant tension and uncertainty&quot;.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="J._Hoberman" title="wikilink">J. Hoberman</a> of <em><a href="The_Village_Voice" title="wikilink">The Village Voice</a></em> said the film was a &quot;gripping&quot; account that did &quot;an excellent job&quot; of taking apart and presenting the footage of events, and said it was &quot;nearly a textbook on media manipulation&quot;.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> Writing for <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>, <a href="Stephen_Holden" title="wikilink">Stephen Holden</a> said the film was &quot;a riveting documentary&quot; that delivered &quot;the suspense of a smaller-scale <em><a href="Seven_Days_in_May" title="wikilink">Seven Days in May</a></em>&quot;, citing the way in which it examined how television can be used to &quot;deceive and manipulate the public&quot;.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> <a href="Ty_Burr" title="wikilink">Ty Burr</a> in the <em><a href="Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">Boston Globe</a></em> called the film &quot;our best chance&quot; to find out what really happened on 11&lt;U+2013&gt;13 April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' &quot;pro-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez stance&quot; meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez's record.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> Burr also said the film's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective. He said, &quot;because [the filmmakers] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them.&quot;<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Nevertheless, Burr concluded that the film's narrow focus remained engrossing.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<p>Desson Thomson of <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em> stated that the film successfully reproduced the &quot;panic and fear&quot; at the palace as events unfolded, saying it came across like a &quot;raw, <a href="Costa-Gavras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Costa-Gavras</a>-style thriller&quot; that was &quot;worth watching down to the last thrilling minute&quot;.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> He said that knowing how uncertain Venezuela's future was made the film even more powerful. Thomson believed the handheld video was put to good use, calling its &quot;news-breaking immediacy ... intoxicating&quot;.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> He concluded, &quot;<em>The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</em> is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie.&quot;<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> In the <em><a href="Miami_New_Times" title="wikilink">Miami New Times</a></em>, Brett Sokol agreed that the film was &quot;never less than thrilling&quot;, but said that as history, it was &quot;strictly agitprop&quot;.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> Similarly, Mark Jenkins wrote in the <em><a href="Washington_City_Paper" title="wikilink">Washington City Paper</a></em> that the film was &quot;unapologetically polemical&quot;, but &quot;notable foremost as a gripping you-are-there account&quot;.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
