<p>The <strong>Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China</strong> ( <small>[<a href="Pronunciation_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">pronunciation</a>]</small>), commonly known as <strong>Hong Kong</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (), is one of the two <a href="special_administrative_region_(People&#39;s_Republic_of_China)" title="wikilink">special administrative regions</a> (SARs) of the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC), the other being <a href="Macau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macau</a>. Comprising over 260 islands, the territory is located on the eastern banks of the <a href="Pearl_River_Delta" title="wikilink">Pearl River Delta</a>, facing the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> in the south and bordering <a href="Guangdong" title="wikilink">Guangdong Province</a> in the north.</p>
<p>Hong Kong was a <a href="crown_colony" title="wikilink">crown colony</a> of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> from 1842 until the <a href="transfer_of_the_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">transfer of sovereignty</a> to the People's Republic of China in 1997. The <a href="Sino-British_Joint_Declaration" title="wikilink">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a> and the <a href="Basic_Law_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Basic Law of Hong Kong</a> stipulate that Hong Kong will operate with a high degree of <a href="Autonomous_entity" title="wikilink">autonomy</a> until at least <a href="2047" class="uri" title="wikilink">2047</a>, fifty years after the transfer. Under the policy of &quot;<a href="one_country,_two_systems" title="wikilink">one country, two systems</a>&quot;, the People's Republic of China is responsible for the territory's defence and foreign diplomacy, while Hong Kong maintains its own <a href="legal_system" title="wikilink">legal system</a>, <a href="currency" class="uri" title="wikilink">currency</a>, <a href="Customs_(tax)" title="wikilink">customs policy</a>, <a href="police_force" title="wikilink">police force</a>, <a href="passport" class="uri" title="wikilink">passport</a>, cultural delegation, international sports teams, and <a href="immigration" class="uri" title="wikilink">immigration</a> laws.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The area now known as Hong Kong became an important trading region and a significant strategic location for the Chinese mainland during the <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang</a> and <a href="Song_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Song</a> <a href="Chinese_dynasties" title="wikilink">dynasties</a>. These populated townships or villages had never been collectively known as Hong Kong before the British settlement arrived. The area began to attract the attention of China and the rest of the world again in the <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a>, when it was ceded to <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Britain</a> after the <a href="Opium_Wars" title="wikilink">Opium Wars</a>. Hong Kong's earliest recorded non-Asian visitor was the <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> <a href="sailor" title="wikilink">mariner</a> <a href="Jorge_&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares" title="wikilink">Jorge &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares</a> who arrived in <a href="1513" class="uri" title="wikilink">1513</a>. &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares began trading with the Chinese, and the Portuguese continued to make periodic trade stops at various locations along the coast.</p>
<p><img src="Old_hong_kong.jpg" title="fig:A waterfall off the Chinese coast where foreign ships obtained fresh water. Near the waterfall, a settlement named Hong Kong Village (&lt;U+9999&gt;&lt;U+6E2F&gt;&lt;U+6751&gt;) provided the origins to the name Hong Kong." alt="A waterfall off the Chinese coast where foreign ships obtained fresh water. Near the waterfall, a settlement named Hong Kong Village (&lt;U+9999&gt;&lt;U+6E2F&gt;&lt;U+6751&gt;) provided the origins to the name Hong Kong." width="200" /> The Portuguese introduced <a href="tea" class="uri" title="wikilink">tea</a>, <a href="silk" class="uri" title="wikilink">silk</a>, and other Asian <a href="luxury_good" title="wikilink">luxury goods</a> to Europe and by the mid-<a href="18th_century" title="wikilink">18th century</a> these items were in high demand, particularly tea. The British, to redress their net outflow of payments to China for tea and to force China to conduct relations like other states, invaded China, winning the <a href="First_Opium_War" title="wikilink">First Opium War</a> in <a href="1841" class="uri" title="wikilink">1841</a>. During the war, <a href="Victoria_Island" title="wikilink">Victoria Island</a> was first occupied by the British, and then formally ceded from the <a href="Qing_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Qing Dynasty</a> of China in <a href="1842" class="uri" title="wikilink">1842</a> under the <a href="Treaty_of_Nanking" title="wikilink">Treaty of Nanking</a>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong became a <a href="Crown_Colony" title="wikilink">Crown Colony</a> in <a href="1843" class="uri" title="wikilink">1843</a> with the first urban settlement in <a href="Victoria_City" title="wikilink">Victoria City</a> (now called <a href="Admiralty%2C_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a>). The <a href="Kowloon_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Kowloon Peninsula</a> south of <a href="Boundary_Street" title="wikilink">Boundary Street</a> and <a href="Stonecutter&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Stonecutter's Island</a> was ceded to the British in perpetuity in <a href="1860" class="uri" title="wikilink">1860</a> under the <a href="Convention_of_Peking" title="wikilink">Convention of Peking</a> after China's defeat in the <a href="Second_Opium_War" title="wikilink">Second Opium War</a>. Expansive adjacent lands to the north, known as the <a href="New_Territories" title="wikilink">New Territories</a> (including <a href="New_Kowloon" title="wikilink">New Kowloon</a> and <a href="Lantau_Island" title="wikilink">Lantau Island</a>), were then <a href="leasing" title="wikilink">leased</a> by Britain from China for 99 years, from <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1898" class="uri" title="wikilink">1898</a> to <a href="30_June" title="wikilink">30 June</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>. For the first 20 years there was little contact between the European and Chinese communities. The first specially-recruited Hong Kong civil servants to be taught <a href="Cantonese_language" title="wikilink">Cantonese</a> were recruited in 1862, markedly improving relations.</p>

The Japanese army executed many Hong Kongers during the war. There was a significant resistance movement most notably on <a href="Lantau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lantau</a> Island during the occupation. After their defeat by the Allied forces, the Japanese surrendered the territory on <a href="15_August" title="wikilink">15 August</a> <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>. Hong Kong quickly re-opened under British rule and welcomed a mass migration of Chinese <a href="refugee" title="wikilink">refugees</a> in <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a>, many of whom were desperately escaping the newly-formed <a href="Communism" title="wikilink">Communist</a> government in China. Some of these refugees were capitalists and wealthy professionals, those deemed as <a href="enemy_of_the_people" title="wikilink">class enemies</a> of <a href="communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">communism</a>. Their migration helped Hong Kong acquire a pool of entrepreneurial talent which, in turn, planted the seeds for the territory's budding capitalist system.</p>
<p>Hong Kong had been a trade port ever since the British occupation, but its position as an <a href="entrep&lt;U+00F4&gt;t" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrep&lt;U+00F4&gt;t</a> declined greatly after the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> ordered a trade embargo against the People's Republic of China during the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>. Many of Hong Kong's businesses had relied on trade with China and were forced to adapt to the loss of trade under the embargo. As a result, a <a href="textile" class="uri" title="wikilink">textile</a> and manufacturing industry was established, taking advantage of a new pool of workers from China willing to work for low wages. During this period, the economy grew extremely rapidly, deeming what many observers described as an &quot;economic miracle&quot;. Towards the <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>, Hong Kong's economy began to move away from the textile and manufacturing industry and began to emphasize development of its financial and banking sector. Leading to even greater growth, Hong Kong quickly became one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Its position as an entrep&lt;U+00F4&gt;t was revived when the <a href="Open_Door_Policy" title="wikilink">Open Door Policy</a> was adopted by the PRC in the late-<a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a> under <a href="Deng_Xiaoping" title="wikilink">Deng Xiaoping</a> reopening China to international trade. Further trade with mainland China was facilitated when <a href="Shenzhen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenzhen</a>, a city north of Hong Kong, was converted into a capitalist hub and declared a <a href="Special_Economic_Zone_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Special Economic Zone</a> in <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a>. Ever since, Shenzhen has served as a vital partner in Hong Kong's economic development and helping to integrate Hong Kong into China's burgeoning market economy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a>, with the lease on the New Territories running out, the United Kingdom Government, led by then Prime Minister <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a>, decided to negotiate the <a href="Transfer_of_the_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">question of the sovereignty of Hong Kong</a>. Although the British were only legally required to transfer the New Territories to the PRC under the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking, Whitehall decided that maintaining a rump colony would not be worthwhile &lt;U+2014&gt; the majority of Hong Kong's land was in the New Territories, and failure to return the entire colony would undoubtedly have generated political friction between the UK and PRC. Furthermore, many believed it was impractical and logistically impossible to dissect Hong Kong, with its industrial base in the New Territories returning to the PRC, while the British retained its commercial base on Victoria Island or commonly known as Hong Kong Island. Interesting idea had came up by the British side, such as exchanging sovereignty of the whole colony for administration right by the UK for fifty years. The Chinese side flatly rejected the British proposal.</p>

<p>Pursuant to an agreement known as the <a href="Sino-British_Joint_Declaration" title="wikilink">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a>, signed by the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> on <a href="19_December" title="wikilink">19 December</a> <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>, the whole territory of Hong Kong under British <a href="colonial" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonial</a> rule became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC promised that under the &quot;<a href="One_Country,_Two_Systems" title="wikilink">One Country, Two Systems</a>&quot; policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping, the <a href="socialism" title="wikilink">socialist</a> <a href="economy_of_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">economic system in mainland China</a> would not be practiced in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's previous <a href="capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalist system</a> and lifestyle would remain unchanged for at least 50 years, until 2047. Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except diplomatic affairs and national defence .</p>
<p>The Joint Declaration came into particular focus in June 1989 when the PRC applied deadly force against pro-democracy demonstrators in <a href="Tiananmen_Square" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square</a> and elsewhere in <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>. The loss of life in the Chinese capital provoked literally millions of Hong Kongers to protest openly in the streets. Concern over Hong Kong's future led to a decline in the <a href="stock_market" title="wikilink">stock market</a>, general disquiet amongst the populace and a wave of migration to overseas destinations, particularly Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Administration of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC at midnight on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, with the last Hong Kong governor, <a href="Chris_Patten" title="wikilink">Chris Patten</a>, leaving on the <a href="HMY_Britannia" title="wikilink">Royal Yacht</a> with HRH Prince Charles and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Patten's successor, shipping tycoon <a href="Tung_Chee_Hwa" title="wikilink">Tung Chee Hwa</a>, was handpicked by Beijing and sworn in as the territory's first Chinese leader. Soon after the handover in July, land values in Hong Kong collapsed substantially and expedited the burst of the <a href="bubble_economy" title="wikilink">bubble economy</a>, as part of the <a href="Asian_financial_crisis" title="wikilink">Asian financial crisis</a>. This was exacerbated by Tung Chee Hwa's unsubstantiated pledge to supply 85,000 new flats annually<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>; which essentially manipulated the region's real-estate prices. In some areas, land values fell by over half; and the <a href="Hang_Seng_Index" title="wikilink">Hang Seng Index</a> <a href="October_27,_1997_mini-crash" title="wikilink">fell by over 1,500 points</a> on <a href="28_October" title="wikilink">28 October</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, losing 22.8% of its value in a week.</p>
<p>On <a href="6_July" title="wikilink">6 July</a> <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Hong Kong's new international airport</a> opened after six years of construction priced at $20 billion. It is considered the last British design and equipped infrastructure built before leaving the territory. Built on an artificially created island in <a href="Chek_Lap_Kok" title="wikilink">Chek Lap Kok</a>, the airport, the <a href="Tsing_Ma_Bridge" title="wikilink">Tsing Ma Bridge</a> and a subway line connecting the airport to the rest of the city were together billed as the most expensive public project in history. Despite logistical problems during its first few months of operation, the airport today is considered one of the world's finest according to <a href="Skytrax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skytrax</a> magazine. The airport replaced the aging and overcrowded <a href="Kai_Tak" title="wikilink">Kai Tak</a> airport where aircraft famously made rooftop landings over dense skyscrapers in Kowloon. Hong Kong was hit badly by the outbreak of the <a href="SARS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SARS</a> virus beginning in mid-March through the summer of 2003. This exacerbated the region's economic problems, especially in the effect that it had on travel to and from Hong Kong. <a href="image:Hkg57rat.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|200px|right|An evening in <a href="Central_(Hong_Kong)" title="wikilink">Central</a>, Hong Kong's financial district. Within a lifetime, Hong Kong has matured from a provincial colonial outpost to an ultramodern global capital of trade and finance.</a></p>
<p>On <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> the same year, half a million people marched in the largest protest rally ever aimed at the government of Hong Kong, voicing concerns about a proposed anti-subversion bill that would have eroded freedom of the press, of religion and of association arising from <a href="Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Article_23" title="wikilink">Article 23</a> of the Hong Kong Basic Law, as well as dissatisfaction with the poor state of the economy. <a href="Regina_Ip" title="wikilink">Regina Ip</a>, then <a href="Secretary_for_Security" title="wikilink">Secretary for Security</a>, and <a href="Antony_Leung" title="wikilink">Antony Leung</a>, then <a href="Financial_Secretary_(Hong_Kong)" title="wikilink">Financial Secretary</a>, were forced to leave office in 2003 under public pressure (though Antony Leung left office for reason unrelated to the SARS and Article 23 crisis, he gave in to public pressure after his involvement in the <a href="Lexusgate#The_Lexusgate_scandal" title="wikilink">Lexusgate scandal</a>).</p>
<p>On <a href="10_March" title="wikilink">10 March</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Tung Chee Hwa submitted his <a href="Tung_Chee_Hwa&#39;s_resignation" title="wikilink">resignation</a> as Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong's Basic Law permitted him to serve another three years, many suspected Beijing forced Tung to resign due to widespread public disapproval and his perceived lacklustre leadership. <a href="Donald_Tsang" title="wikilink">Donald Tsang</a>, the <a href="Chief_Secretary_for_Administration_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong</a>, served as Acting Chief Executive until <a href="25_May" title="wikilink">25 May</a>, when he, too, resigned to take part in the campaign for the new Chief Executive election. Following an interim government headed by <a href="Henry_Tang" title="wikilink">Henry Tang</a>, Tsang was elected as Chief Executive.</p>
<p>On <a href="12_September" title="wikilink">12 September</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Disneyland</a> finally opened to the public on <a href="Lantau_Island" title="wikilink">Lantau Island</a> with jubilant fanfare after six years of planning and construction. Many believed the park would attract increased tourism dollars to Hong Kong and cement the city's status as a world class metropolis. However, many criticised the government's decision to subsidise part of the $3.5 billion construction price tag, the park's lower-than-expected attendance and poor park management.</p>

<p>Pursuant to <a href="Hong_Kong_Basic_Law" title="wikilink">Basic Law</a>, Hong Kong's constitutional document, the local Hong Kong government retains sovereignty over the territory except in areas of national defence and foreign relations. Only the <a href="Chief_Executive_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chief Executive</a>, Hong Kong's head of government, is appointed by Beijing. All other functionaries of the government, including members the executive and legislative branch, are either appointed by the Chief Executive (directly or by proxy) or elected by voters. In theory, this arrangement guarantees Hong Kong is governed almost independently of the PRC and can retain its unique cultural, legal and economic infrastructure. In practice, however, some have accused Beijing of excess intrusion into Hong Kong domestic affairs beyond levels permitted under Basic Law.</p>
<p>Laws in Hong Kong are enacted only by approval of the Chief Executive and majority consent from the 60 seat <a href="Legislative_Council_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Legislative Council of Hong Kong</a>, or Legco. Despite the often said undemocratic nature of Hong Kong's government, half of Legco's seats are elected under <a href="universal_suffrage" title="wikilink">universal suffrage</a> with the other half selected by <a href="functional_constituencies" title="wikilink">functional constituencies</a> consisting of trade unions and special interests. Basic Law guarantees that all seats will eventually be elected under universal suffrage. <img src="HK_Chater_Road_LegCo_view.jpg" title="fig:The Legislative Council of Hong Kong" alt="The Legislative Council of Hong Kong" width="200" /> <img src="GH_facade.JPG" title="fig:The Government House in Central where the Chief Executive resides." alt="The Government House in Central where the Chief Executive resides." width="200" /></p>
<p><a href="Donald_Tsang" title="wikilink">Donald Tsang</a> currently holds the office of the <a href="Chief_Executive_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chief Executive</a> after his election on <a href="16_June" title="wikilink">16 June</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> by an electoral committee appointed by Beijing <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Before the 1997 handover, Tsang had held the post of <a href="Chief_Secretary_for_Administration_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chief Secretary for Administration</a> under British rule. He was elevated to his current post on <a href="24_June" title="wikilink">24 June</a> 2005 and is scheduled to complete the remaining portion of <a href="Tung_Chee_Hwa" title="wikilink">Tung Chee Hwa</a>'s last term which ends on <a href="30_June" title="wikilink">30 June</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> in accordance to the interpretation of <a href="Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Annex_One" title="wikilink">Annex I</a> and <a href="Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Article_46" title="wikilink">Article 46</a> by the <a href="Standing_Committee_of_the_National_People&#39;s_Congress" title="wikilink">Standing Committee of the National People's Congress</a>.</p>
<p>The election of a new Chief Executive by the 852-member <a href="Election_Committee" title="wikilink">Election Committee</a> was expected to be held on <a href="10_July" title="wikilink">10 July</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>. On <a href="16_June" title="wikilink">16 June</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, <a href="Donald_Tsang" title="wikilink">Donald Tsang</a> was acclaimed the winner as the only candidate securing the required 100 nominations from members of the election committee. Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief Executive, assumed office on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, following his election by a 400-member <a href="Election_Committee" title="wikilink">electoral college</a>. For the second five-year term of the Chief Executive which began in July 2002, Tung was the only nominated candidate and therefore acclaimed.</p>
<p>The PRC set up a <a href="Provisional_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)</a> in 1996 just before the handover, where it moved to Hong Kong to have its meetings after the handover. It reverted some laws passed by the colonial Legislative Council, which was formed by means of <a href="universal_suffrage" title="wikilink">universal suffrage</a> since 1995. The PLC passed some new laws, such as the Public Order Ordinance,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which required permission from police to hold a demonstration where the number of people who participates exceeds 30. <a href="Legislative_Council_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Legislative Council</a> <a href="Hong_Kong_legislative_election" title="wikilink">elections</a> were held on <a href="24_May" title="wikilink">24 May</a> <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, on <a href="10_September" title="wikilink">10 September</a> <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a> and again on <a href="12_September" title="wikilink">12 September</a> <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, with the next election scheduled for 2008. According to the <a href="Hong_Kong_Basic_Law" title="wikilink">Basic Law</a>, Hong Kong's &quot;mini-<a href="constitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">constitution</a>&quot;, the present third term of the Legislative Council has 25 seats directly elected from geographical constituencies and 30 seats elected from <a href="functional_constituency" title="wikilink">functional constituencies</a>. The 1998, 2000 and <a href="Hong_Kong_legislative_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004</a> Legislative Council elections were seen as free, open, and widely contested, despite discontent among mainly 'pro-democratic' politicians, who contended that the functional constituency elections and the Election Committee elections (for 1998 and 2000) were undemocratic, as they consider that the electorate for these seats is too narrow.</p>
<p>The civil service of Hong Kong maintains its quality and neutrality following its tradition in the colonial times, operating without discernible direction from <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a>. Many government and administrative operations are located in Central on Hong Kong Island near the historical location of <a href="Victoria_City" title="wikilink">Victoria City</a>, the site of the original British settlements.</p>

But one of the major pro-government parties refused to vote for passing the bill. Thus the government found that the bill could not be passed. So it shelved<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> the drafted law<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> brought forth by Article 23. The focus of controversies shifted to the issue of <a href="universal_suffrage" title="wikilink">universal suffrage</a> towards the end of 2003 and in 2004, which was the slogan of another <a href="July_1_marches" title="wikilink">mass demonstration</a> on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="24_September" title="wikilink">24 September</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, 25 Hong Kong pro-democracy Legco members, some of whom were previously labelled as traitors by Beijing after the 1989 <a href="Tiananmen_Square_crackdown" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square crackdown</a> and barred from entering the mainland, crossed the border into the southern province of <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>, following an unprecedented invitation by the PRC.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The invitation was generally regarded as one of the greatest goodwill gestures from the PRC to the Hong Kong democrats since the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p>
<p>On <a href="4_December" title="wikilink">4 December</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, a <a href="124_March" title="wikilink">demonstration</a> was organised by the <a href="Civil_Human_Rights_Front" title="wikilink">Civil Human Rights Front</a> and <a href="pro-democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">pro-democracy</a> lawmakers to demand a timetable for universal suffrage to be included in political reform proposals for the 2007 and 2008 elections for the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council respectively. The turnout was reported to be 63,000 by the police, and at least 250,000 by the organisers. The proposals would have doubled the size of the election committee (from 800 members to 1,600) and added ten seats to the Legislative Council (5 geographic and 5 functional seats for district councillors). On <a href="22_December" title="wikilink">22 December</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, the reforms, proposed by the <a href="Chief_Executive" title="wikilink">Chief Executive</a> of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, were defeated by the <a href="pro-democracy_camp" title="wikilink">pro-democracy camp</a> after they failed to reach the necessary two-third threshold with 34 votes in favour and 24 opposed. In the wake of the defeat, China and the Chief Executive have indicated that reforms will not be possible until the 2012 elections. The defeat also did little to blunt Tsang's popularity, with his approval ratings only dropping from 82 to 79% in the wake of the vote.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong is not an independent country, it retains its own delegation in international organizations such as the <a href="Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation" title="wikilink">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a> and the <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic Games</a> (although it changed its name from &quot;Hong Kong&quot; to &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; after 1997).

<p>In contrast to mainland China's <a href="Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="wikilink">civil law</a> system, Hong Kong continues to follow the <a href="common_law" title="wikilink">common law</a> tradition established by British colonial rule. Article 84 of the <a href="Basic_Law_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Basic Law of Hong Kong</a> allows Hong Kong's courts to refer to decisions (<a href="precedents" class="uri" title="wikilink">precedents</a>) rendered by courts of other common law jurisdictions. Articles 82 and 92 allow invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to participate in proceedings of Hong Kong's <a href="Court_of_Final_Appeal" title="wikilink">Court of Final Appeal</a> and sit as Hong Kong judges.</p>
<p>Structurally, Hong Kong's court system consists of the <a href="Hong_Kong_Court_of_Final_Appeal" title="wikilink">Court of Final Appeal</a> which replaced the <a href="Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a>, the <a href="High_Court_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">High Court</a>, which is made up of the <a href="Court_of_Appeal_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Court of Appeal</a> and the <a href="Court_of_First_Instance_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Court of First Instance</a>, and the <a href="District_Court_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">District Court</a>, which includes the <a href="Family_Court_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Family Court</a>. Other adjudicative bodies include the Lands Tribunal, the Magistrates' Courts, the Juvenile Court, the Coroner's Court, the Labour Tribunal, the Small Claims Tribunal, and the Obscene Articles Tribunal, which is responsible for classifying non-video pornography to be circulated in Hong Kong. Justices of the <a href="Hong_Kong_Court_of_Final_Appeal" title="wikilink">Court of Final Appeal</a> are appointed by Hong Kong's Chief Executive.

The vast majority of <a href="lawyer" title="wikilink">lawyers</a> are <a href="solicitor" title="wikilink">solicitors</a>, who are licensed and regulated by <a href="the_Law_Society_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">the Law Society of Hong Kong</a>. <a href="Barristers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barristers</a>, on the other hand, are licensed and regulated by the <a href="Hong_Kong_Bar_Association" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Bar Association</a>. Only <a href="barristers" class="uri" title="wikilink">barristers</a> are allowed to appear in the <a href="Hong_Kong_Court_of_Final_Appeal" title="wikilink">Court of Final Appeal</a> and the <a href="High_Court_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">High Court</a>.

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p><img src="CIA-HongKong.jpg" title="fig:General map of Hong Kong" alt="General map of Hong Kong" width="200" /> </p>
<p>Hong Kong primarily consists of <a href="Hong_Kong_Island" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Island</a>, <a href="Lantau_Island" title="wikilink">Lantau Island</a>, <a href="Kowloon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kowloon</a> and the <a href="New_Territories" title="wikilink">New Territories</a> (see map <a href="#Administrative_divisions" title="wikilink">below</a>). The <a href="Kowloon_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Kowloon Peninsula</a> is attached to the New Territories to the north, and the New Territories spans northwards eventually connecting with <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a> across the <a href="Sham_Chun_River" title="wikilink">Sham Chun River</a> (Shenzhen River). In total, Hong Kong encompasses a collection of <a href="Islands_and_peninsulas_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">262 islands</a> in the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a>, of which <a href="Lantau_Island" title="wikilink">Lantau</a> is the largest. Hong Kong Island is the second largest island and the most populated. <a href="Ap_Lei_Chau" title="wikilink">Ap Lei Chau</a> is the most densely populated island in the world.</p>
<p>The name &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, literally meaning &quot;fragrant harbour&quot;, is derived from the area around present-day <a href="Aberdeen,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="Wong_Chuk_Hang" title="wikilink">Wong Chuk Hang</a> on Hong Kong Island where fragrant trees were once abundant and widely exported.

<p>Hong Kong's long, irregular and curvaceous <a href="coast" title="wikilink">coastline</a> also affords the territory with many bays, rivers and <a href="Beaches_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">beaches</a>. Despite the territory's extensive wooded and ocean setting, environmental awareness is growing as Hong Kong's air ranks as one of the most polluted. Approximately 70&lt;U+2013&gt;80% of the city's smog originates from other parts of the <a href="Pearl_River_Delta" title="wikilink">Pearl River Delta</a>.</p>

Hong Kong occasionally has <a href="typhoon" title="wikilink">typhoons</a> in the summer and early autumn. The ecology of Hong Kong is mostly affected by the results of climatic changes. Hong Kong's climate is seasonal due to alternating wind direction between winter and summer. Hong Kong has been geologically stable for millions of years, though landslides are common especially after rain. Flora and fauna in Hong Kong are altered by climatic change, sea level alternation and human impact.</p>
<p>The highest recorded temperature<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> in Hong Kong is 36.1&lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">C</a> (97.0&lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">F</a>) while the lowest recorded temperature is 0.0&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (32.0&lt;U+00B0&gt;F).

<p><img src="2_International_Financial_Centre.jpg" title="fig:2 International Finance Centre, Hong Kong" alt="2 International Finance Centre, Hong Kong" width="150" />Today, Hong Kong is the world's 11th largest trading entity and 13th largest <a href="bank" title="wikilink">banking centre</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.

Hong Kong is a rich city with a GDP per capita surpassing most Western nations'. To put in perspective Hong Kong's economic strength, its closest Chinese rival, Shanghai, has a GDP of <a href="&lt;U+00A5&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A5&gt;</a>46,586 (ca. <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a> 5,620) per capita in 2003, ranked no. 13 among all 659 Chinese cities. Hong Kong on the other hand, possessed an unparalleled GDP of &lt;U+00A5&gt;310,021 (ca. US$ 37,400), ranked #1 in Asia. It has one of the world's most and is a major international centre of <a href="finance" class="uri" title="wikilink">finance</a> and <a href="trade" class="uri" title="wikilink">trade</a>. The dominant presence of international trade is reflected in the number of <a href="consulate" title="wikilink">consulates</a> in the territory: <a href="As_of_2006" title="wikilink">as of December 2006</a>, 114 countries maintained <a href="List_of_countries_with_consulates_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">consulates or consulates-general in Hong Kong</a>, more than any other city in the world. (Even <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, host of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, has only 104 consulates.) The objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability. Given the highly externally-oriented nature of the economy, this objective was further defined as a stable external value for the <a href="Hong_Kong_dollar" title="wikilink">Hong Kong dollar</a> in terms of a linked <a href="exchange_rate" title="wikilink">exchange rate</a> against the US dollar at the rate of approximately HK$7.80 to one <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">United States dollar</a> until 2005, when it was allowed to trade within a band of HK$7.75–$7.85. Hong Kong has limited <a href="natural_resources" title="wikilink">natural resources</a>, and most <a href="food" class="uri" title="wikilink">food</a> and raw materials must be imported. In fact, <a href="International_trade" title="wikilink">imports</a> and <a href="export" title="wikilink">exports</a> (including re-exports) exceed the <a href="gross_domestic_product" title="wikilink">GDP</a> of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has extensive trade and investment ties with the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> which existed even before the <a href="Transfer_of_the_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">handover</a> on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>. These ties and its autonomous status enable it to be the middleman between the <a href="Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Republic of China</a> on <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> and the mainland. Flights, investment, and trade from Taiwan go through Hong Kong to get to the mainland. The <a href="tertiary_sector_of_industry" title="wikilink">service sector</a> represented 86.5% of the GDP in 2001.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The territory, with a highly sophisticated banking sector and good communication links, hosts the <a href="Asia" title="wikilink">Asian</a> headquarters of many <a href="multinational_corporation" title="wikilink">multinational corporations</a>.</p>

Growth averaged a strong 8.9% per annum in real terms in the 1970s and 7.2% p.a. in the 1980s. As the economy shifted to services (manufacturing currently accounts for just 4% of GDP), growth slowed to 2.7% p.a. in the 1990s, including a 5.3% decline in 1998, due to the <a href="Asian_financial_crisis" title="wikilink">Asian financial crisis'</a> impact on demand in the region. Growth since 2000 has averaged 5.2% p.a. amid strong deflation.<img src="Hkdisneyfireworks.jpg" title="fig:Hong Kong Disneyland during a fireworks display" alt="Hong Kong Disneyland during a fireworks display" width="150" />The economy rebounded rapidly, growing by 10% in 2000. A world-wide global downturn and the <a href="Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome" title="wikilink">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</a> (SARS) outbreak reduced economic growth to 2.3% in 2003. Thereafter, a boom in tourism from the mainland because of China's easing of travel restrictions, a return of consumer confidence, and a solid rise in exports resulted in the resumption of strong growth in late 2003 and 2004, with growth averaging 6.5% in the first half of 2005. To further increase economic co-operation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the <a href="Individual_Visit_Scheme" title="wikilink">Individual Visit Scheme</a> was started on <a href="28_July" title="wikilink">28 July</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, which allows travellers from some cities in mainland China to visit Hong Kong without an accompanying tour group. As a result, the <a href="Tourism_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">tourism industry in Hong Kong</a> is booming due to an exponential increase in the number of visitors from mainland China. The upsurge is also boosted by the recent opening of <a href="Hong_Kong_Disneyland_Resort" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Disneyland Resort</a>.</p>
<p>A revival in both external and domestic demand led to a strong upswing in growth in 2004, surging to 8.2% for the year. The domestic sector completely shrugged off its earlier sluggishness, and the general weakness of the Hong Kong dollar, when included with the still modest cost and price pressures in Hong Kong, has resulted in a strengthening in Hong Kong's external price competitiveness. In addition, Hong Kong's 68-month-long <a href="deflation_(economics)" title="wikilink">deflationary</a> spiral, the longest and highest deflation according to <a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a>, ended in mid-2004, with consumer price <a href="inflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflation</a> hovering at near zero levels.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a> and <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>, Hong Kong's fast-paced industrialisation earned it a place as one of the four original <a href="East_Asian_Tigers" title="wikilink">East Asian Tigers</a>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong enjoys low rates of both personal and corporate taxation. Concerned at the territory's narrow tax base and the government's over-dependence on tax revenue from property transactions, the government is consulting the public on the proposed introduction of a <a href="Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Hong_Kong)" title="wikilink">Goods and Services Tax</a> (GST). Initial popular reaction has been largely unfavourable, primarily because of concerns that it will impose an undue burden on the poorer members of society, and may also harm Hong Kong's attractiveness as a tourist destination.</p>

<p>The population of Hong Kong increased sharply throughout the 1990s reaching 6.9 million in 2006. About 96% of Hong Kong's population is of <a href="Zhonghua_Minzu" title="wikilink">Chinese descent</a>, the majority of which are <a href="Cantonese_people" title="wikilink">Cantonese</a> with ethnic groups such as the <a href="Hakka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hakka</a> and <a href="Teochew" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teochew</a> also substantially represented. <a href="Standard_Cantonese" title="wikilink">Cantonese</a>, a Chinese dialect commonly spoken in southern China, is Hong Kong's official dialect and spoken by an overwhelming majority of the local population. <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> is also an official language of Hong Kong and is widely spoken and used at the workplace by more than a third of the population. Signs displaying both Chinese and English are extremely common throughout the territory. Since the 1997 handover, new groups of <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a> immigrants have increased the ethnic diversity of the territory and intensified the usage of <a href="Mandarin_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a>, the official Chinese dialect of mainland China. With Hong Kong's integration into the mainland economy, local employers are increasingly seeking out Mandarin speakers.<img src="Hkpeoplestamps.jpg" title="fig:1989 postage stamps commemorating the racial, cultural and occupational diversity of Hong Kong." alt="1989 postage stamps commemorating the racial, cultural and occupational diversity of Hong Kong." width="200" />The remaining 4% of the population is composed of non-ethnic Chinese forming a highly visible group (see <a href="Lan_Kwai_Fong" title="wikilink">Lan Kwai Fong</a> and <a href="Tai-Pan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tai-Pan</a>) despite their smaller numbers. Among these is a significant <a href="South_Asians_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">South Asian</a> population, mostly Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalese with some of them born in Hong Kong and speaking fluent Cantonese although few are also literate in Chinese. Some <a href="Nepal" title="wikilink">Nepalese</a> residing in Hong Kong are <a href="Gurkha" title="wikilink">Gurkhas</a> who, along with their families and descendants, chose to remain after their military and civil service to Britain. In addition, over 15,000 <a href="Vietnam" title="wikilink">Vietnamese</a> landing in Hong Kong as <a href="refugee" title="wikilink">refugees</a> have become permanent residents.</p>
<p>Approximately 130,000 <a href="Filipinos_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Filipinos</a> work in Hong Kong as <a href="Foreign_domestic_helpers_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">foreign domestic helpers</a>, commonly referred to locally as <em><a href="amah" title="wikilink">amahs</a></em>, or <em>feiyung</em>. A smaller cadre of domestic workers originates from <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a>. On Sundays and public holidays, tens of thousands of these non-Chinese workers, majority of whom are female, gather in public places to socialise and attend religious services mostly in <a href="Central,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Central</a> (mainly Filipinos), <a href="Victoria_Park_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Victoria Park</a> (mainly Indonesians) and <a href="Tsimshatsui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tsimshatsui</a>. There are also a large number of <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europeans</a>, <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North Americans</a>, <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australians</a>, <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>, and <a href="Korea" title="wikilink">Koreans</a> working in Hong Kong's commercial and financial sector, many of whom live in <a href="Mid-Levels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mid-Levels</a>, an upscale section of the city popular amongst expatriates. The top three points-of-origin for foreigners in Hong Kong are the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> (132,770), <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> (95,460), and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> (31,330). <img src="Centraladm.jpg" title="fig:A view of Central, Admiralty and Mid-Levels displaying high density residential towers common in large sections of densely populated Hong Kong." alt="A view of Central, Admiralty and Mid-Levels displaying high density residential towers common in large sections of densely populated Hong Kong." width="200" /> Considered as a dependency, Hong Kong is one of the <a href="List_of_countries_by_population_density" title="wikilink">most densely populated countries/dependencies in the world</a>, with an overall density of more than 6,200 people per km&lt;U+00B2&gt;. Hong Kong has a <a href="fertility_rate" title="wikilink">fertility rate</a> of 0.95 children per woman,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> one of the lowest in the world and far below the 2.1 children per woman required to sustain the current population. However, population in Hong Kong continues to grow due to the influx of immigrants from mainland China numbering approximately 45,000 per year. <a href="List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" title="wikilink">Life expectancy</a> in Hong Kong is 81.6 years as of 2006. If Hong Kong was an independent country, it would rank fifth longest in the world.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's population is very unevenly distributed. It has an extremely dense urban core, normally associated with &quot;the city (&lt;U+5E02&gt;&lt;U+5340&gt;)&quot;, consisting of <a href="Kowloon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kowloon</a> and the north of <a href="Hong_Kong_Island" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Island</a>, which is <a href="Central_and_Western_District" title="wikilink">Central and Western District</a>, <a href="Wan_Chai_District" title="wikilink">Wan Chai District</a>, <a href="Eastern_District,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Eastern District</a>, <a href="Yau_Tsim_Mong_District" title="wikilink">Yau Tsim Mong District</a>, <a href="Kowloon_City_District" title="wikilink">Kowloon City District</a>, <a href="Sham_Shui_Po_District" title="wikilink">Sham Shui Po District</a>, <a href="Wong_Tai_Sin_District" title="wikilink">Wong Tai Sin District</a>, and <a href="Kwun_Tong_District" title="wikilink">Kwun Tong District</a>. The rest is relatively sparsely populated, with millions of residents scattered irregularly thoroughout the New Territories, south Hong Kong island, Lantau Island and other outlying islands. An increasing amount of Hong Kongers are even living in <a href="Shenzhen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenzhen</a>, a Chinese city north of Hong Kong, and commuting across the border.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p><img src="HKUST_Sundial.JPG" title="fig:Hong Kong University of Science and Technology" alt="Hong Kong University of Science and Technology" width="200" /> <img src="Hkpolyu.jpg" title="fig:Hong Kong Polytechnic University" alt="Hong Kong Polytechnic University" width="200" />A former <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> colony, Hong Kong's <a href="education" class="uri" title="wikilink">education</a> system is roughly based upon <a href="Education_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">that of the United Kingdom</a>, and in particular, the <a href="Education_in_England" title="wikilink">system used in England</a>. At the higher education levels, both British and American systems exist. The <a href="University_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">University of Hong Kong</a> (HKU), being the oldest institution of tertiary education in the territory, has traditionally been based on the British model but has switched to the American model in recent years. Second to HKU in terms of history, the <a href="Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> (CUHK) follows the American model with a characteristically British college system. The <a href="Hong_Kong_University_of_Science_and_Technology" title="wikilink">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> (HKUST) was established on the American model of higher education. There are <a href="Higher_Education_in_Hong_Kong#Institutes" title="wikilink">nine public universities</a> in Hong Kong, and a number of <a href="Higher_Education_in_Hong_Kong#Institutes" title="wikilink">private higher institutions</a>. Hong Kong's public schools are operated by the <a href="Education_and_Manpower_Bureau" title="wikilink">Education and Manpower Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region</a>. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The system features a non-compulsory three-year <a href="kindergarten" class="uri" title="wikilink">kindergarten</a>, followed by a compulsory six-year primary education, three-year junior <a href="secondary_education" title="wikilink">secondary education</a>; a non-compulsory two-year senior secondary education leading to the <a href="Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examinations</a> and a two-year <a href="matriculation" class="uri" title="wikilink">matriculation</a> course leading to the <a href="Hong_Kong_Advanced_Level_Examination" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Advanced Level Examinations</a>. A new &lt;U+201C&gt;3+3+4&lt;U+201D&gt; senior secondary curriculum, consisting of a three-year junior secondary, three-year senior secondary and four-year undergraduate academic system, will be implemented from 2009 onwards. There are also <a href="Tertiary_education" title="wikilink">tertiary institutions</a> offering various Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral degrees, other <a href="Higher_Diploma" title="wikilink">higher diplomas</a>, and <a href="associate_degree" title="wikilink">associate degree</a> courses.</p>
<p>Most comprehensive schools in Hong Kong fall under three categories: government schools (rare), subsidised schools and private schools. Subsidised schools are by far the most common type, and include government-aided and grant schools, run by charitable organisations often with religious affiliations (mostly <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a>, but <a href="Buddhist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhist</a>, <a href="Taoist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoist</a>, <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> and <a href="Confucian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucian</a> as well). Meanwhile, <a href="private_school" title="wikilink">private schools</a>, often run by Christian organisations, have admissions based on academic merit rather than on financial resources. Outside this system are the schools under the <a href="Direct_Subsidy_Scheme" title="wikilink">Direct Subsidy Scheme</a> (DSS) and private <a href="international_school" title="wikilink">international schools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<p><a href="image:Avenue_of_Stars2.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|200px|A statue on the <a href="Avenue_of_Stars,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Avenue of Stars</a>, a tribute to Hong Kong cinema.</a><a href="image:Hkratqueensroad.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|200px|On Queen's Road Central outside <a href="Lan_Kwai_Fong" title="wikilink">Lan Kwai Fong</a>. Hong Kong culture is often referred to as a marriage between East and West, a tight cultural and bilingual arrangement evident throughout the territory.</a></p>
<p>Hong Kong is frequently described as a city where East meets West, a meeting reflected in its economic infrastructure, education, legal system and street culture. On one street corner, there may be traditional Chinese shops selling <a href="Chinese_herbal_medicine" title="wikilink">Chinese herbal medicine</a>, <a href="Buddhist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhist</a> paraphernalia or bowls of synthetic <a href="shark_fin_soup" title="wikilink">shark fin soup</a>. But around the next, one may find theatres showing the latest <a href="Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> blockbuster, a British-style pub, a <a href="List_of_Catholic_Church_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a> or <a href="Ronald_McDonald" title="wikilink">Ronald McDonald</a> inviting passer-bys to a <a href="Big_Mac" title="wikilink">Big Mac</a>. The territory's official language is Chinese and English; signs in both languages are omnipresent throughout Hong Kong. The government, police and most workplaces and stores conduct business bilingually. British rule may have ended a decade ago but Western culture is deeply ingrained in Hong Kong and coexists seamlessly with traditional philosophy and practices of the Orient.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has an active nightlife centred on two major entertainment districts, <a href="Lan_Kwai_Fong" title="wikilink">Lan Kwai Fong</a> (Central) and <a href="Wan_Chai" title="wikilink">Wan Chai</a>. Both areas are frequented by expatriates and locals alike. For a more quiet evening, a trip to <a href="Victoria_Peak" title="wikilink">Victoria Peak</a> offers a spectacular view of the city. There is also a promenade along the <a href="Tsim_Sha_Tsui" title="wikilink">Tsim Sha Tsui</a> waterfront, which is popular among young Chinese couples. Shopping, a form of entertainment for the people of Hong Kong, is even done at nighttime as evident in the <a href="Temple_Street_Night_Market" title="wikilink">Temple Street Night Market</a> where one can also catch free performances of <a href="Peking_opera" title="wikilink">Peking opera</a>.</p>
<p>The city's cosmopolitan flavour can also be seen in the wide variety of cuisines available. While different varieties of Chinese selections, especially seafood, are most popular, there are also many European, American, Japanese, Korean, and other restaurants. Ethnic dishes served in <em><a href="cha_chaan_teng" title="wikilink">cha chaan teng</a></em> and <em><a href="dai_pai_dong" title="wikilink">dai pai dong</a></em> are also popular. The people of Hong Kong take their food seriously and many top chefs make their way to the city to show off their talents to these discerning diners.</p>
<p><img src="BruceLee14.jpg" title="fig:Bruce Lee battles Chuck Norris in Way of the Dragon. Lee is arguably Hong Kong&#39;s first major entertainment export." alt="Bruce Lee battles Chuck Norris in Way of the Dragon. Lee is arguably Hong Kong&#39;s first major entertainment export." width="150" />While Hong Kong is a global centre of trade, perhaps the city's most famous export is its entertainment industry, particularly in the martial arts genre. Several top-notch Hollywood performers originate from Hong Kong cinema -- <a href="Bruce_Lee" title="wikilink">Bruce Lee</a>, <a href="Chow_Yun-Fat" title="wikilink">Chow Yun-Fat</a>, <a href="Jackie_Chan" title="wikilink">Jackie Chan</a>, <a href="Michelle_Yeoh" title="wikilink">Michelle Yeoh</a>, <a href="Jet_Li" title="wikilink">Jet Li</a> and <a href="Leslie_Cheung" title="wikilink">Leslie Cheung</a>, to name a few. Behind the camera, Hong Kong filmmakers have also struck fortune in Hollywood such as <a href="John_Woo" title="wikilink">John Woo</a>, <a href="Wong_Kar-wai" title="wikilink">Wong Kar-wai</a>, <a href="Tsui_Hark" title="wikilink">Tsui Hark</a> and martial arts choreographers who have designed fight scenes in the <em><a href="Matrix_trilogy" title="wikilink">Matrix trilogy</a></em>, <em><a href="Kill_Bill" title="wikilink">Kill Bill</a></em> and <em><a href="Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon" title="wikilink">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a></em>. Back in Hong Kong, several homegrown films have also gained international recognition such as <em><a href="Chungking_Express" title="wikilink">Chungking Express</a></em>, <em><a href="Infernal_Affairs" title="wikilink">Infernal Affairs</a></em>, <em><a href="Shaolin_Soccer" title="wikilink">Shaolin Soccer</a></em>, <em><a href="Rumble_in_the_Bronx" title="wikilink">Rumble in the Bronx</a></em> and <em><a href="In_the_Mood_for_Love" title="wikilink">In the Mood for Love</a></em>. Acclaimed filmmaker <a href="Quentin_Tarantino" title="wikilink">Quentin Tarantino</a> has said he's strongly influenced by <a href="Hong_Kong_action_cinema" title="wikilink">Hong Kong action cinema</a>.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government also supports cultural institutions such as the <a href="Hong_Kong_Heritage_Museum" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Heritage Museum</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="Hong_Kong_Academy_for_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts</a> and the <a href="Hong_Kong_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Furthermore, the government's <a href="Leisure_and_Cultural_Services_Department" title="wikilink">Leisure and Cultural Services Department</a> also subsidizes and sponsors the bringing of international performers to Hong Kong.</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p><img src="Buddha_lantau.jpg" title="fig:The Tian Tan Buddha on Lantau, Hong Kong, the tallest bronze buddha in the world and a symbol of the faith&#39;s influence in the territory and amongst the Chinese worldwide." alt="The Tian Tan Buddha on Lantau, Hong Kong, the tallest bronze buddha in the world and a symbol of the faith&#39;s influence in the territory and amongst the Chinese worldwide." width="200" />Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of religious freedom, a right enshrined and protected through its constitutional document, the Basic Law. The majority of Hong Kong's population, as in <a href="Mainland_China" title="wikilink">Mainland China</a>, practice a folk version of <a href="Buddhism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a>. A sizable <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> community of around 500,000 exists, forming about 10% of the total population; roughly equally divided between <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholics</a> and <a href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestants</a>. There are also around 200,000 followers each of authentic <a href="Buddhism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a> and <a href="Taoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taoism</a>. Apart from the major religions, there are also a significant number of followers of other religions, including an estimated 3,000 <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jews</a> and a number of <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>, <a href="Hinduism" title="wikilink">Hindus</a>, <a href="Sikhism" title="wikilink">Sikhs</a> and <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_Faith" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s</a>. Apart from offering religious instructions, many major religious bodies have established schools and provided <a href="social_welfare" title="wikilink">social welfare</a> facilities.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's religious beliefs are tied to the region's early role as a <a href="fishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishing</a> community. <a href="Matsu_(goddess)" title="wikilink">Tin Hau</a>, the protector of seafarers, has been honoured with several <a href="Places_of_worship_in_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">temples</a> throughout Hong Kong for at least 300 years. <a href="Hung_Shing" title="wikilink">Hung Shing</a>, another protector of seafarers, has also been honoured for centuries . Hongkongers, especially elder generations, visit Taoist or Buddhist temples to appease the deities and, usually, to request compassion, good health or good fortune. Gifts of <a href="food" class="uri" title="wikilink">food</a>, and in particular <a href="fruit" class="uri" title="wikilink">fruit</a>, are presented, and <a href="incense" class="uri" title="wikilink">incense</a> and <a href="paper" class="uri" title="wikilink">paper</a> offerings are burnt in respect.</p>
<p>With the transfer of Hong Kong to the PRC, there were significant concerns over <a href="freedom_of_religion" title="wikilink">religious freedom</a> in Hong Kong. So far, this has proved mostly unfounded. Despite the banning of the <a href="Falun_Gong" title="wikilink">Falun Gong</a> movement by <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a> in 1999, adherents are still free to practice in Hong Kong. Similarly, the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a> freely appoints its own bishops in Hong Kong, unlike on mainland China where the only approved 'Catholic' institution is the <a href="Chinese_Patriotic_Catholic_Association" title="wikilink">Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association</a> where bishops and priests are appointed by Beijing (though there is also an unofficial and illegal part of the Catholic church that maintains contact with the Vatican). A significant issue in the normalisation of ties between the PRC and the <a href="Vatican_City" title="wikilink">Vatican</a> is Beijing's insistence that the Vatican drops its diplomatic ties with the <a href="Political_status_of_Taiwan" title="wikilink">ROC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="Bank_of_china_night.jpg" title="fig:The Bank of China Tower at dusk." alt="The Bank of China Tower at dusk." width="200" /> </p>
<p>Due to the <a href="creative_destruction" title="wikilink">creative destruction</a> so endemic to Hong Kong over the past 50 years, few historical buildings remain in Hong Kong. Instead the city has become a centre for <a href="modern_architecture" title="wikilink">modern architecture</a>, especially in and around <a href="Central_and_Western_District" title="wikilink">Central</a>. Dense commercial skyscrapers between Central and Causeway Bay lining the coast of <a href="Victoria_Harbour" title="wikilink">Victoria Harbour</a> is one of Hong Kong's most famous tourist attractions and ranked the best skyline in the world. Four of the top 15 tallest skyscrapers in the world are in Hong Kong. In <a href="Kowloon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kowloon</a>, which once included the anarchistic settlement called the <a href="Kowloon_Walled_City" title="wikilink">Kowloon Walled City</a>, strict height restrictions on structures were in force until 1998 with the closure of nearby <a href="Kai_Tak_Airport" title="wikilink">Kai Tak Airport</a>. With restrictions lifted, several new skyscrapers in Kowloon are being planned including <a href="International_Commerce_Centre" title="wikilink">International Commerce Centre</a> which, when completed in 2010, will become the world's fourth tallest.</p>
<figure>
<img src="ThePeakTower_20041223.jpg" title="The Peak Tower at Victoria Peak " alt="The Peak Tower at Victoria Peak " width="200" /><figcaption>The Peak Tower at <a href="Victoria_Peak" title="wikilink">Victoria Peak</a> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hong Kong's best-known building is arguably <a href="I._M._Pei" title="wikilink">Ieoh Ming Pei</a>'s <a href="Bank_of_China_Tower" title="wikilink">Bank of China Tower</a>, completed in 1990 and now Hong Kong's third tallest skyscraper. The building attracted heated controversy from the start, as its sharp angles were said to cast negative <a href="feng_shui" title="wikilink">feng shui</a> energy into the heart of Hong Kong. Predating the Bank of China Tower, another well-known structure is the <a href="HSBC_Hong_Kong_headquarters_building" title="wikilink">HSBC Headquarters Building</a>, finished in 1985. It was built on the site of Hong Kong's first skyscraper, which was finished in 1935 and was the subject of a bitter heritage <a href="Architectural_conservation" title="wikilink">conservation</a> struggle in the late 1970s. Both banks' buildings are featured on many of <a href="Hong_Kong_banknotes" title="wikilink">Hong Kong's banknotes</a>.</p>
<p>The tallest building in Hong Kong is the International Finance Centre 2. One of the largest construction projects in Hong Kong and the world was the new <a href="Hong_Kong_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Hong Kong International Airport</a> on <a href="Chek_Lap_Kok" title="wikilink">Chek Lap Kok</a> near <a href="Lantau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lantau</a>, a huge land reclamation project linked to the centre of Hong Kong by the <a href="Lantau_Link" title="wikilink">Lantau Link</a>, which features three new major <a href="bridge" title="wikilink">bridges</a>: <a href="Tsing_Ma_Bridge" title="wikilink">Tsing Ma</a>, the world's <a href="List_of_largest_suspension_bridges" title="wikilink">sixth largest</a> <a href="suspension_bridge" title="wikilink">suspension bridge</a>; <a href="Kap_Shui_Mun_Bridge" title="wikilink">Kap Shui Mun</a>, the world's longest <a href="cable-stayed_bridge" title="wikilink">cable-stayed bridge</a> carrying both road and railway traffic; and <a href="Ting_Kau_Bridge" title="wikilink">Ting Kau</a>, the world's first major four-span cable-stayed bridge.</p>
<p>Particularly notable about Hong Kong's skyline and streetscape is the omnipresence of public housing estates, which began as a squatter resettlement program in the 1950s, and now houses close to 50% of the population. These estates have evolved from seven-storey walk-up apartments with public toilets and minimal amenities, allocated on a basis of 24 square feet per adult, half of that for a child, to high-quality high-rises. The public rental program has been supplemented with a government-subsidized Home Ownership Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>

<p><img src="LM1362.jpg" title="fig:Double-decker bus in Hong Kong" alt="Double-decker bus in Hong Kong" width="200" /> <img src="Starferryrat.jpg" title="fig:The iconic Star Ferry on one of its 9 minute voyages across the harbour." alt="The iconic Star Ferry on one of its 9 minute voyages across the harbour." width="200" /> <img src="hkbusrat.jpg" title="fig:Large crowd waits at a bus stop in a city where the vast majority of residents rely on public transport." alt="Large crowd waits at a bus stop in a city where the vast majority of residents rely on public transport." width="200" /> <img src="HongKong_Tram.JPG" title="fig:A tram in Hong Kong." alt="A tram in Hong Kong." width="200" /> Hong Kong has a highly developed and sophisticated <a href="transport" class="uri" title="wikilink">transport</a> network, encompassing both <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public</a> and private transport. The <a href="Octopus_card" title="wikilink">Octopus card</a> stored value <a href="smart_card" title="wikilink">smart card</a> payment system can be used to pay for fares on almost all railways, buses and ferries in Hong Kong. The Octopus card uses RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to allow users to scan their card without taking it out of their wallet or bag. All <a href="parking_meter" title="wikilink">parking meters</a> in Hong Kong accept payment by Octopus card only, and Octopus card payment can be made at various car parks.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is dominated by steep, hilly terrain, and some unusual methods of transport have been devised to ease movement up and down the slopes. For example, the <a href="Peak_Tram" title="wikilink">Peak Tram</a> has provided vertical rail transport between Central and <a href="Victoria_Peak" title="wikilink">Victoria Peak</a> since 1888 by steeply ascending the side of a mountain. In <a href="Central_and_Western_district" title="wikilink">Central and Western district</a> there is an extensive system of <a href="escalator" title="wikilink">escalators</a> and <a href="moving_sidewalk" title="wikilink">moving sidewalks</a>, including the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world, the <a href="Central-Mid-Levels_escalator" title="wikilink">Mid-levels Escalator</a>. And on Lantau Island, the newly constructed <a href="Ngong_Ping_Skyrail" title="wikilink">Ngong Ping Skyrail</a> service traverses over dense mountainous terrain with <a href="Aerial_tramway" title="wikilink">aerial cable cars</a> to link <a href="Tung_Chung" title="wikilink">Tung Chung Town Centre</a> with <a href="Ngong_Ping" title="wikilink">Ngong Ping</a>.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has several different modes of public rail transport. The two <a href="metro" class="uri" title="wikilink">metro</a> systems for the city are the <a href="MTR" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTR</a> (Mass Transit Railway) and <a href="KCR" class="uri" title="wikilink">KCR</a> which acts as a link between Hong Kong and mainland China (KCR also operates a <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> system in northwest New Territories). These are operated by the <a href="MTR_Corporation_Limited" title="wikilink">MTR Corporation Limited</a> and the <a href="Kowloon-Canton_Railway_Corporation" title="wikilink">Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation</a> respectively. The <a href="Hong_Kong_Tramways" title="wikilink">tramway system</a> covers the northern parts of Hong Kong Island and is the only <a href="tram" class="uri" title="wikilink">tram</a> system in the world run exclusively by <a href="double_decker" title="wikilink">double deckers</a>.</p>
<p>Five separate companies operate franchised public <a href="bus" class="uri" title="wikilink">bus</a> services in Hong Kong. Double-decker buses were introduced to Hong Kong in 1949. They are now used almost exclusively in Hong Kong, just as in <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. However, single-decker buses remain in use for routes with lower demand or roads with lower carrying capacity. Such single-decker buses are mainly used on Lantau Island and for overnight services. Most normal franchised bus routes in Hong Kong operate until 1 am. <a href="Public_light_bus" title="wikilink">Public light buses</a> run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas where standard bus lines cannot reach or do not reach as frequently, quickly, or directly. <a href="Taxicab" title="wikilink">Taxis</a> are also widely used throughout Hong Kong. 99% of taxis in Hong Kong run on liquefied petroleum gas; the rest are still diesel operated.</p>
<p>Most ferry services are provided by licensed ferry operators serving <a href="Islands_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">outlying islands</a>, new towns, across <a href="Victoria_Harbour" title="wikilink">Victoria Harbour</a>, <a href="Macau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macau</a> and cities in mainland China. The oldest service, the legendary <a href="Star_Ferry" title="wikilink">Star Ferry</a>, operates four lines between <a href="Kowloon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kowloon</a> and Hong Kong Island and has provided cost-effective transport for over a century. Popular with tourists desiring a panoramic view of Hong Kong's skyline and harbour, many Hong Kongers consider the Star Ferry as one of the city's most treasured cultural icons. Additionally, 78 &quot;<a href="kai-to" class="uri" title="wikilink">kai-to</a>&quot; ferries are licensed to serve remote coastal settlements.</p>
<p><img src="HKIA.JPG" title="fig:Hong Kong International Airport" alt="Hong Kong International Airport" width="200" />Hong Kong has one active <a href="international_airport" title="wikilink">international airport</a>, known as <a href="Hong_Kong_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Hong Kong International Airport</a> located at <a href="Chek_Lap_Kok" title="wikilink">Chek Lap Kok</a>. This replaced the famous <a href="Kai_Tak_Airport" title="wikilink">Kai Tak Airport</a> located in Kowloon in 1998. After high-profile delays in the cargo systems in the first few months, the airport now serves as a transport hub for <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a>, and as the hub for <a href="Cathay_Pacific_Airways" title="wikilink">Cathay Pacific Airways</a>, <a href="Dragonair_(airline)" title="wikilink">Dragonair</a>, <a href="Air_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Air Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Oasis_Hong_Kong_Airlines" title="wikilink">Oasis Hong Kong Airlines</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong_Airlines" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Airlines</a> and <a href="Hong_Kong_Express" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Express</a>. Additionally, both Hong Kong International Airport and <a href="Cathay_Pacific_Airways" title="wikilink">Cathay Pacific Airways</a> have been voted best in the world, in the airport and airline criteria respectively, by <a href="Skytrax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skytrax</a> from 2001 to 2005. <a href="Hong_Kong_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Hong Kong International Airport</a> served more than 36 million passengers in the year 2004, and increased to over 40 million passengers in 2005.</p>
<p>Access to the airport includes 'Airport Express', 'CityFlyers' and 'Airbuses'. These services connect the airport to the rest of Hong Kong. The Airport Express zooms passengers to <a href="Central,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Central</a> on Hong Kong Island in just 23 minutes. The recent opening of <a href="Sunny_Bay_(MTR)" title="wikilink">Sunny Bay Station</a> of the <a href="MTR" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTR</a> allows easy access to the Disneyland Resort.</p>
<p>While the <a href="traffic" class="uri" title="wikilink">traffic</a> in <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a> <a href="drive_on_the_right" title="wikilink">drives on the right</a>, Hong Kong still maintains its own <a href="rule_of_the_road" title="wikilink">road rules</a>, with traffic continuing to <a href="drive_on_the_left" title="wikilink">drive on the left</a>. There are about 517,000 registered vehicles in Hong Kong, 64% of which are privately owned passenger cars. As a metropolis for luxury in Asia, Hong Kong is world famous for having the most Rolls-Royce cars per capita in the world.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Note that the Hong Kong highway code uses the same road sign system as Great Britain whereas the Chinese system is different.</p>
<h2 id="military">Military</h2>
<p><img src="IMG_0482.jpg" title="fig:The headquarters of the People&#39;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison (former Prince of Wales Building)" alt="The headquarters of the People&#39;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison (former Prince of Wales Building)" width="200" />  Hong Kong has never had its own military forces because it has never been a sovereign state, except voluntary auxiliary force like <a href="The_Royal_Hong_Kong_Regiment_(The_Volunteers)" title="wikilink">The Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers)</a>. All defence matters have been dependent on the state which controls Hong Kong. Before the British handover to PRC sovereignty, defence was provided by the <a href="British_military" title="wikilink">British military</a>, who stationed soldiers in barracks throughout Hong Kong, including the <a href="British_Forces_Overseas_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">British Forces Overseas Hong Kong</a>. Its finance was supported by the Hong Kong Government.</p>
<p>The People's Republic of China <a href="Central_People&#39;s_Government" title="wikilink">Central People's Government</a> (CPG) assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on <a href="1_July" title="wikilink">1 July</a> <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a> and stationed a <a href="garrison" class="uri" title="wikilink">garrison</a> of the <a href="PLA_Hong_Kong_Garrison" title="wikilink">People's Liberation Army</a> (PLA) to manage its defence affairs. Although the garrison has little practical military value, the stationing of the PLA troops in Hong Kong is a significant symbol of the PRC government's assumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong's Basic Law, military forces stationed in Hong Kong shall not interfere with local civil affairs; the Hong Kong Government shall remain responsible for the maintenance of public order. The Hong Kong Garrison, composed of <a href="army" title="wikilink">ground</a>, <a href="navy" title="wikilink">naval</a>, and <a href="air_force" title="wikilink">air forces</a>, is under the command of the Chinese <a href="Central_Military_Commission" title="wikilink">Central Military Commission</a>. The garrison subsequently opened its barracks on <a href="Stonecutters_Island" title="wikilink">Stonecutters Island</a> and <a href="Stanley,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Stanley</a> to the public to promote understanding and trust between the troops and residents.</p>
<p>Under British rule, ethnic Chinese Hong Kong residents (and other Hong Kong residents) were able to join the <a href="British_Forces_Overseas_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">British Forces Overseas Hong Kong</a>. However, since the handover in 1997, no Hong Kong resident is allowed to join the PLA.</p>
