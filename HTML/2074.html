Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male.&quot;</ref> In communities that practise it, it is supported by women and men, particularly by the women, who see it as a source of honour and authority, and an essential part of raising a daughter well.<ref><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305">Mackie 1996</a>, p. 1009 (also available <a href="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf">here</a>).</li>

<p>After removing the clitoris with the knife, the woman &quot;lifts up the skin that is left with her thumb and index finger to remove the remaining flesh.

The girl may be pinned down so firmly that bones may fracture.&quot;</ref> Anthropologist <a href="Janice_Boddy" title="wikilink">Janice Boddy</a> witnessed the infibulation of two sisters in northern Sudan in 1976; the procedure was carried out by a traditional circumciser, or midwife, using an anaesthetic:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Boddy wrote that older women in Sudan recalled a procedure much more painful, in which the circumciser would scrape away the external genitals with a straight razor, and with no anaesthetic. She would then pull the skin on either side of the wound together and secure it with acacia thorns, inserting a straw or hollow reed to create a hole for urine and menstrual blood. The girl would lie with her legs tied together for up to 40 days.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The infibulated woman's vulva is cut open for sexual intercourse and childbirth. It can take up to two years for a husband to penetrate his wife's infibulation. Boddy wrote in 1989 that it was a point of pride for men in Sudan that their wives give birth within a year of marriage, so the midwife might have to be sent for secretly to enlarge the wife's opening.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, a social psychologist, interviewed 300 Sudanese women and 100 Sudanese men in the 1980s and described the penetration by the men of their wives' infibulation:</p>

<h3 id="who-type-iv">WHO Type IV</h3>
<p>A variety of other procedures are collectively known as Type IV, which the WHO defines as &quot;all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example, pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.&quot; The WHO does not include cosmetic procedures such as <a href="labiaplasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">labiaplasty</a> or procedures used in <a href="sex_reassignment_surgery" title="wikilink">sex reassignment surgery</a> within its categories of FGM (see <a href="#comparison" title="wikilink">below</a>).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Women may request reinfibulation &lt;U+2013&gt; the restoration of the infibulation &lt;U+2013&gt; after giving birth, known in Sudan as <em>El-Adel</em> (re-circumcision or, literally, &quot;putting right&quot; or &quot;improving&quot;). Two cuts are made around the vagina, then sutures are put in place to tighten it to the size of a pinhole. Vanja Bergrren writes that this has the effect of mimicking virginity. It may also be carried out just before marriage, after divorce or to prepare elderly women for death.<ref name=Bergrren>Bergrren, Vanja, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217115">&quot;Being Victims or Beneficiaries?

<li>Rahman and Toubia 2000, pp. 5&lt;U+2013&gt;6: &quot;A fundamental reason advanced for female circumcision is the need to control women's sexuality ...

</ul>
<p>The primary sexual concerns vary between communities. <a href="Anika_Rahman" title="wikilink">Rahman</a> and Toubia write that the focus in Egypt, Sudan and Somalia is on curbing premarital sex, whereas in Kenya and Uganda it is to reduce a woman's sexual desire for her husband so that he can more easily take several wives. In both cases, they argue, the aim is to serve the interests of male sexuality.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes argued in 1975 that, in Sudan, virginity is more of a concept than a physiological state, and that a woman can regain her virginity and honour (her <em>ird</em>, or sexual dignity) by being infibulated.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Female genitals are regarded within communities that practise FGM as dirty and ugly; physicians Miriam Martinelli and <a href=":es:Jaume_Enric_Oll&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Jaume Enric Oll&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Goig</a> write that the preference is for women's genitalia to be &quot;flat, rigid and dry.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In some societies, such as among the <a href="Dogon_people" title="wikilink">Dogon people</a> of Mali, the procedure is performed to differentiate between the genders, based on the belief that the clitoris confers masculinity on a girl and the foreskin of a boy makes him feminine. Gruenbaum writes that in northern Sudan the clitoris and labia (the &quot;masculine&quot; parts) are viewed as ugly, and the smooth, infibulated vulva as feminine, at least by women who support infibulation.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> There are also various myths about the dangers of the clitoris: girls are told it will keep on growing, will harm a baby if it comes into contact with the baby's head, can make men impotent, and that failing to have it removed will see them shunned by the community.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> A more practical reason for FGM's continuance is that the female circumcisers or midwives rely to some extent on the practice for their living and status, and are therefore inclined to declare it a cultural necessity.<ref>Windle, Sarah et al. &quot;Harmful Traditional Practices and Women's Health: Female Genital Mutilation&quot; in John Erihi (ed.), <em>Maternal and Child Health: Global Challenges, Programs, and Policies</em>, Springer 2009, p. 180.</p>

<p>Mackie compares FGM with the practice of <a href="footbinding" class="uri" title="wikilink">footbinding</a> in China. Like FGM, footbinding was an ethnic marker carried out on young girls, was nearly universal where practised, controlled sexual access to women, was tied to ideas about honour, appropriate marriage, health, fertility and aesthetics, was supposed to enhance male sexual pleasure, and was supported by the women themselves.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>A 1988 poem by Somali woman Dahabo Musa described infibulation as the &quot;three feminine sorrows&quot;: the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman has to be cut open, then childbirth when she has to be cut again.<ref>Abdalla, Raqiya D. &quot;'My Grandmother Called it the Three Feminine Sorrows: The Struggle of Women Against Female Circumcision in Somalia,&quot; in Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf (ed.), <em>Female Circumcision: Multicultural Perspectives</em>, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA187">p. 187</a>.

<p>Nearly 59 percent of 3,210 Sudanese women in physician Asma El Dareer's 1980s study said they preferred Types II and III over Type I.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Women in Sudan discussing circumcision with Janice Boddy in 1984 depicted Type I by opening their mouths and Type III by closing them tight, asking her: &quot;Which is better, an ugly opening or a dignified closure?&quot; Boddy wrote that the women avoided being photographed laughing or smiling for the same reason, preferring human orifices to be left closed or minimized, particularly female ones.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Izett and Toubia write that any change to the state of a woman's infibulation can affect her sense of identity and security. They cite the case of a Somali mother of three who was advised to remain defibulated after childbirth to cure her <a href="gonorrhoea" class="uri" title="wikilink">gonorrhoea</a>, but who insisted on being re-infibulated, leading to pain and infection so severe she could hardly walk.

Sociologist Elizabeth Heger Boyle writes that, in Tanzania, the <a href="Maasai_people" title="wikilink">Masai</a> will not call an uncircumcised woman &quot;mother&quot; when she has children, and the <a href="Kuria_people" title="wikilink">Kuria</a> laugh at uncut women when they go bathing.

<p>Some Western feminists &lt;U+2013&gt; to the anger of their African counterparts &lt;U+2013&gt; have attributed the women's support for FGM to <a href="false_consciousness" title="wikilink">false consciousness</a>, the idea that they have simply internalized the <a href="sexism" class="uri" title="wikilink">sexism</a> of their environments.<ref>Duncan, Jennifer S. &quot;French feminism's struggle to become global,&quot; in Francisca de Haan, Margaret Allen, June Purvis (eds.), <em>Women's Activism: Global Perspectives from the 1890s to the Present</em>, Routledge, 2013, p. 193: &quot;That French feminists would fail to recognize the dissonance surrounding their campaigns against female genital cutting among African women highlights the problems of coalition building within a feminist framework. In particular, the feminist notion of false consciousness, which asserted that individual women were often complicit in their own oppression as they internalized sexist ideas about themselves, provoked hostility among African women who were suspicious of Western feminist motives and of solutions that did not incorporate complementary gender roles.&quot;</p>

<li>Pedwell, Carolyn. <em>Feminism, Culture and Embodied Practice: The Rhetorics of Comparison</em>, Routledge, 2010, p. 62: &quot;[F]eminist theorists ... seek to break down binaries which depict 'female genital mutilation' as the result of complicity, oppression and false consciousness <em>against</em> representations of cosmetic surgery as a free, empowered and authentic choice.&quot;</li>

For the most part, Western feminists have found themselves in a dilemma in dealing with female circumcision. To label women of a different culture as having a 'false consciousness' for advocating circumcision sounds like a delegitimization of the culture or beliefs of others.&quot;</ref> Mackie calls the support a &quot;belief trap&quot;: &quot;a belief that cannot be revised because the costs of testing the belief are too high.&quot; The cost of dissent in this case, he writes, is that the dissenters may fail to have descendants.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></li>

<h3 id="support-from-men">Support from men</h3>
<p>In a study in the Gambia, where Types I and II are practised and three out of 4 women are cut, just over 60 percent of men said they supported FGM and intended to have it performed on their daughters. Almost 72 percent did not know that it had negative health effects. Most said they were not involved in the decision to have their daughters cut. Men between 31 and 45 expressed the least support for it.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>A reason women often offer in support of infibulation is that it enhances male sexual pleasure.

This is curious, because FGM, beyond the mild <em>sunna</em> supposedly akin to male circumcision, is not found in most Islamic countries nor is it required by Islam. Mutilation is not practiced in Mecca or Medina, and Saudis reportedly find the custom pagan. The Koran is silent on FGM, but several <em>hadith</em> (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife.&quot;</p>

<p>Egyptologist Mary Knight writes that there is only one extant reference from <a href="Ancient_history" title="wikilink">antiquity</a> that suggests FGM might have been practised outside Egypt. <a href="Xanthus_(historian)" title="wikilink">Xanthus of Lydia</a> wrote in a history of <a href="Lydia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lydia</a> in the fifth century BCE: &quot;The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women.&quot; Knight argues from the context that &quot;castrate&quot; refers here to a form of sterilization.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Mackie writes that FGM in Africa became tied up with the <a href="Slavery_in_Africa" title="wikilink">slave trade</a>.

The English explorer <a href="William_George_Browne" title="wikilink">William Browne</a> (1768&lt;U+2013&gt;1813) reported in 1799 that infibulation was carried out on slaves in Egypt to prevent pregnancy (although the Swedish ethnographer, <a href=":sv:Carl_G&lt;U+00F6&gt;sta_Widstrand" title="wikilink">Carl G&lt;U+00F6&gt;sta Widstrand</a>, argued that the slave traders simply paid a higher price for women who were infibulated anyway), and the Portuguese missionary <a href="Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_dos_Santos" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o dos Santos</a> (d. 1622) wrote of a group in Mogadishu who had a &quot;custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them.&quot;<ref name=Mackie1996p1003><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096305">Mackie 1996</a>, p. 1003 (also <a href="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf">here</a>), citing Carl G&lt;U+00F6&gt;sta Widstrand, &quot;Female Infibulation,&quot; <em>Studia Ethnographica Upsaliensia</em>, XX, 1960, pp. 95&lt;U+2013&gt;124, and Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o dos Santos, <em>Ethiopia Oriental</em>, 1609, in G.S.P.

<li>Physician and ethnologist <a href="Charles_Gabriel_Seligman" title="wikilink">Charles Seligman</a> (1873&lt;U+2013&gt;1940) suggested in 1913 that FGM derived from ceremonies performed by <a href="Afroasiatic_languages" title="wikilink">Hamito-Semitic</a> people on the <a href="Red_Sea" title="wikilink">Red Sea</a> coast, spreading westwards and southwards across Africa; see Seligman, Charles G. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2843546">&quot;Aspects of the Hamitic problems in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan&quot;</a>,<em>The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland</em>, 1913, 40(3), (pp. 593&lt;U+2013&gt;705), pp. 612, 639&lt;U+2013&gt;640.</li>

<p>As a result of immigration, FGM spread to Australia, Canada, Europe (particularly France and the UK, because of immigration from former colonies), New Zealand, Scandinavia and the United States.<ref><a href="http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf">UNICEF 2005</a>, p. 4: &quot;Beyond economic factors, migratory patterns have frequently reflected links established in the colonial past.

<p>There have been several challenges to the prevailing discourse on FGM.

<p>Shweder argues that anthropologists who specialize in gender issues in Africa have long been aware of the discrepancies between their own experiences and the global discourse on FGM.

See <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/31">&quot;Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003&quot;</a>, legislation.gov.uk, and <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/female_genital_mutilation/#a02">&quot;Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003&quot;</a> (legal guidance), Crown Prosecution Service: &quot;The Act refers to 'girls', though it also applies to women.&quot;</ref> Because anti-FGM laws are not used to stop cosmetic genital procedures, Ess&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and Johnsdotter argue that it seems the law distinguishes between Western and African female genitals, and deems only African women unfit to make their own decisions. Where FGM is banned even if consent is given, physicians may end up having to ask of prospective patients whether they appear to be victims of African patriarchy before deciding whether to offer them genital alteration.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Arguing against these parallels, philosopher <a href="Martha_Nussbaum" title="wikilink">Martha Nussbaum</a> writes that the key issue with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. She argues that the distinction between social pressure, which might reduce autonomy, and physical force is always morally and legally salient, and is arguably comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> She also argues that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than that of women in the Western world, and that this &lt;U+2013&gt; together with a lack of political power &lt;U+2013&gt; reduces their ability to make informed choices for themselves and their families.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>

Medical records are also of limited use in determining morbidity due to FGM/C because complications resulting from the practice, including subsequent difficulties in childbirth, are often not recognised or reported as such and may be attributed to other causes. In some cases, these assigned causes may be medical in nature, but in others, they may reflect traditional beliefs or be attributed to supernatural causes. As a result, many girls who experience complications are treated with traditional medicines or cures and are not referred to health centres.&quot;<a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
