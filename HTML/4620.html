Shortly thereafter, <a href="Dr._Cristina_Yang" title="wikilink">Dr. Cristina Yang</a> (<a href="Sandra_Oh" title="wikilink">Sandra Oh</a>) and <a href="Dr._Lexie_Grey" title="wikilink">Dr. Lexie Grey</a> (<a href="Chyler_Leigh" title="wikilink">Chyler Leigh</a>) are working in the emergency room, when <a href="Dr._Owen_Hunt" title="wikilink">Dr. Owen Hunt</a> (<a href="Kevin_McKidd" title="wikilink">Kevin McKidd</a>) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident <a href="Jackson_Avery" title="wikilink">Dr. Jackson Avery</a> (<a href="Jesse_Williams_(actor)" title="wikilink">Jesse Williams</a>)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act in the manner of Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (<a href="Robert_Baker_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Baker</a>). After months of the two not speaking, <a href="Dr._Callie_Torres" title="wikilink">Dr. Callie Torres</a> (<a href="Sara_Ramirez" title="wikilink">Sara Ramirez</a>)'s father, Carlos (<a href="Hector_Elizondo" title="wikilink">Hector Elizondo</a>), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a>.

Angry about the revelation that Percy was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong <a href="dialysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialysis</a> to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the <a href="kidney_transplant" title="wikilink">kidney transplant</a> she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a <a href="cardiothoracic_surgeon" title="wikilink">cardiothoracic surgeon</a> to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, but subsequently apologizes. <a href="Arizona_Robbins" title="wikilink">Dr. Arizona Robbins</a> (<a href="Jessica_Capshaw" title="wikilink">Jessica Capshaw</a>), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality.
