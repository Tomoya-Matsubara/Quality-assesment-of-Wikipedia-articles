<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><em>Cars</em> takes place in a world populated by <a href="anthropomorphism" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> motor vehicles. The film begins with the last race of the Piston Cup championship, which ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran <a href="Strip_Weathers" title="wikilink">Strip Weathers</a>, perennial runner-up <a href="Chick_Hicks" title="wikilink">Chick Hicks</a>, and rookie <a href="Lightning_McQueen" title="wikilink">Lightning McQueen</a>. The <a href="tiebreaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">tiebreaker</a> race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Lightning is desperate to win the race, as it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a rust treatment for old cars, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, Lightning pushes his <a href="Semi-trailer_truck" title="wikilink">big rig</a>, <a href="Mack_(Cars)" title="wikilink">Mack</a>, to travel all night long. While McQueen sleeps, the exhausted Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of <a href="The_Delinquent_Road_Hazards" title="wikilink">reckless street racers</a>, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the truck. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic, and speeds off the highway to find Mack, ending up in the run-down town of Radiator Springs and inadvertently tearing up the pavement of its main road.</p>
<p>After being arrested and impounded overnight, McQueen is ordered by the town's judge and doctor, <a href="Doc_Hudson" title="wikilink">Doc Hudson</a>, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer <a href="Sally_Carrera" title="wikilink">Sally Carrera</a> insists that McQueen be given <a href="community_service" title="wikilink">community service</a> to repave the road, which Doc agrees. McQueen tries to repave it quickly in a day, but the job is shoddy and McQueen is forced to restart the job again, taking several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stopover along <a href="U.S._Route_66" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 66</a>, but with the construction of a highway nearby that bypassed the town, it effectively was erased from the map. McQueen also discovers Doc is really the <a href="Fabulous_Hudson_Hornet" title="wikilink">Fabulous Hudson Hornet</a>, a three-time Piston Cup winner forced out of racing after an accident, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in town with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered himself.</p>
<p>At the speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully on the race, and soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, decked out in his Fabulous Hudson Hornet markings, has taken over as his racing chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. Hicks, refusing to lose, sends Weathers into a dangerous accident. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media snub Hicks' victory and give praise to McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with his current sponsors as appreciate of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will set up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p><em>Cars</em> is the last film worked on by <a href="Joe_Ranft" title="wikilink">Joe Ranft</a>, who died in a car crash in 2005. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after <em><a href="Corpse_Bride" title="wikilink">Corpse Bride</a></em>. This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for <a href="Paul_Newman" title="wikilink">Paul Newman</a> before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It turned out to be the highest-grossing film of his career.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>The original script (called <em>The Yellow Car</em>, about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world), some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars could be the next movie after <em>A Bug's Life</em> and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of <em><a href="Toy_Story_2" title="wikilink">Toy Story 2</a></em>. Later, production resumed with major script changes.</p>
<p><a href="John_Lasseter" title="wikilink">John Lasseter</a> has said that the idea for <em>Cars</em> was born after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted <a href="Michael_Wallis" title="wikilink">Michael Wallis</a>, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film.</p>
<p>In 2001, the movie's working title was <em>Route 66</em> (after <a href="U.S._Route_66" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 66</a>), but in 2002, the title was changed to prevent people from thinking it was related to the 1960 <a href="Route_66_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">television show with the same name</a>. In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year), but was changed to 95 (the year <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> was released).</p>
<h3 id="animation">Animation</h3>
<p><img src="carsanimation.png" title="fig:Work-in-progress screenshot." alt="Work-in-progress screenshot." /> For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company. Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.</p>
<p>Unlike most <a href="anthropomorphic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the <a href="Tonka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tonka</a> Talking Trucks, and the characters from <a href="Tex_Avery" title="wikilink">Tex Avery</a>'s <em>One Cab's Family</em> short and Disney's own <em><a href="Susie_the_Little_Blue_Coupe" title="wikilink">Susie the Little Blue Coupe</a></em>), rather than within the headlights. According to <a href="production_designer" title="wikilink">production designer</a> Bob Pauley, &quot;From the very beginning of this project, <a href="John_Lasseter" title="wikilink">John Lasseter</a> had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The characters also use their tires as hands and feet, the exceptions being the various tow truck characters that sometimes use their tow hooks, and the various forklift characters, which use their forks. Some cars are showing shuffling sideways by moving their wheels about on their suspensions.</p>
<p>Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em> and 1,000 times faster than those used in <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em>. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms very similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The track on which the opening race (Motor Speedway of the South) takes place is based on an enlarged version of <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a>. The venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race (the Los Angeles International Speedway) is a conglomeration of the <a href="Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a>, the <a href="Arroyo_Seco_(Los_Angeles_County)" title="wikilink">Arroyo Seco</a> in Pasadena where the <a href="Rose_Bowl_(stadium)" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl</a> is located, as well as the <a href="Auto_Club_Speedway" title="wikilink">Auto Club Speedway</a> in Fontana. The Scoring Pylon (showing numbers 43, 86, and 95) is taken from the <a href="Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>.</p>
<p>The sign &quot;City of EmeryvilleÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; Closed for the race&quot; is a nod to <a href="Pixar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pixar</a>'s headquarters in <a href="Emeryville,_California" title="wikilink">Emeryville</a>, California in the <a href="San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="wikilink">San Francisco Bay Area</a>.</p>

However, the physical location of Radiator Springs in relation to <a href="I-40" class="uri" title="wikilink">I-40</a> is similar to that of <a href="Peach_Springs,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Peach Springs</a>, Arizona.</p>
<p>Lasseter told film critic <a href="Joe_Williams_(film_critic)" title="wikilink">Joe Williams</a> of the <a href="St._Louis_Post-Dispatch" title="wikilink">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> that much of the story is based on the recollections of barber Angel Delgadillo in the Route 66 town of <a href="Seligman,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Seligman</a>, Arizona, where business withered soon after the opening of I-40.</p>

<p>Lizzie's Curio Shop in Radiator Springs resembles the crazy Route 66 jumble of memorabilia and <a href="wikt:knick-knack" title="wikilink">knick-knacks</a> at Hackberry General Store in Hackberry, Arizona and the Sand Hills Curiosity Shop, aka the City Meat Market building in <a href="Erick,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Erick</a>, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>During the closing credits, the characters are at a drive-in watching clips of the Pixar films &quot;Toy Car Story&quot; (<em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em>), &quot;Monster Trucks, Inc.&quot; (<em><a href="Monsters,_Inc." title="wikilink">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>) and <em><a href="A_Bug&#39;s_Life" title="wikilink">A Bug's Life</a></em>, whose characters have been rendered as vehicles in the style of <em>Cars</em>.</p>

<h4 id="route-66">Route 66</h4>
<p>Many characters and places in the movie are directly inspired by real <a href="U.S._Route_66" title="wikilink">Route 66</a> places and people.</p>
<p>To quote the Pixar crew:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;As we traveled on Route 66, we were privileged to visit many places and to meet a number of people who live and work alongside 'The Mother Road.' The following is a list of the places and people we wanted to honor by including their names in our 'Special Thanks' credits at the end of the film.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Among the many references to Route 66 landmarks and personalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cozy Cone Motel's design is based on the two <a href="Wigwam_Motel" title="wikilink">Wigwam Motels</a> along Rt. 66, in <a href="Holbrook,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Holbrook</a>, Arizona and <a href="Rialto,_California" title="wikilink">Rialto</a>, California. These were once two out of seven built motels, with individual cabins shaped like teepees. Three Wigwam Motels remain; the third (and oldest) is in Cave City, Kentucky, far from Route 66. The recently restored Tee Pee Motel in Wharton, Texas, south of Houston, is of similar design but unrelated. The name &quot;Cozy Cone&quot; was inspired by the Cozy Dog Drive-In of Springfield, Illinois, which lays claim to being birthplace of the <a href="corn_dog" title="wikilink">corn dog</a>.</li>
<li>The character &quot;Fillmore&quot;, referring to the famous San Francisco music venue <a href="The_Fillmore" title="wikilink">The Fillmore</a>, was at one time to be named &quot;Waldmire&quot; after <a href="Bob_Waldmire" title="wikilink">Bob Waldmire</a>, a self-proclaimed <a href="hippie" class="uri" title="wikilink">hippie</a> artist known to Rt. 66 fans for his detailed pen-and-ink maps and postcards of the route. Though Waldmire's family owns the Cozy Dog Drive-In, Bob, having since become a <a href="vegan" class="uri" title="wikilink">vegan</a>, preferred not to see his name put on a character that would become a McDonald's Happy Meal toy.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
<li>Ramone's House of Body Art is based primarily on the <a href="U-Drop_Inn" title="wikilink">U-Drop Inn</a> in <a href="Shamrock,_Texas" title="wikilink">Shamrock</a>, Texas. It opened in 1936 as Tower <a href="Conoco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conoco</a> (from its distinctive <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> spire) with the U-Drop Inn Cafe and a retail building attached. Many other establishments built along Route 66 in its heyday had Art Deco elements that might be reflected in the design of Ramone's.</li>
<li>The yellow billboard for Lizzie's Curio Shop reading &quot;HERE IT IS&quot; with an image of a Model T is based on the <a href="Jack_Rabbit_Trading_Post" title="wikilink">Jack Rabbit Trading Post</a> signage in Joseph City, Arizona.</li>
<li>Sheriff is voiced by <a href="Michael_Wallis" title="wikilink">Michael Wallis</a>, an American historian and author of <em>Route 66: The Mother Road</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cameo">Cameo</h3>
<p>The group of small birds from the 2001 Pixar short film <em><a href="For_the_Birds_(film)" title="wikilink">For the Birds</a></em> made a <a href="cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo appearance</a> in Cars. As Mack is en route to California at 17:44 in the film, the group of small birds can briefly be seen (and heard) sitting on their familiar telephone wire. In addition, the Pizza Planet truck from <em>Toy Story</em> also makes a cameo outside of the race track, at the final race in the movie.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>
<p><em>Cars</em> was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004 the movie's release date was changed to June 9, 2006.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios, or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> When Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a Summer release schedule, with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h3>
<p><em>Cars</em> opened on June 9, 2006 to generally positive reviews. William Arnold of the <em><a href="Seattle_Post-Intelligencer" title="wikilink">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a></em> praised it as &quot;one of Pixar's most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and Lisa Schwarzbaum of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> called it &quot;a work of American art as classic as it is modern.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Some critics expressed that <em>Cars</em> did not hold up to the standard of other <a href="Pixar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pixar</a> films due to its lengthy story, especially after the acclaim received by <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em>, Pixar's previous film. &quot;The movie is great to look at and a lot of fun,&quot; wrote critic <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a>, &quot;but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Laura Clifford of website Reeling Reviews wrote that the film's &quot;only real drawback is its failure to inspire awe with its visuals and to thoroughly transport with its storytelling.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave Cars a fresh 74% (with an average of 6.9),<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> yet no other Pixar Film has ever scored less than 91%, but it still received a &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; rating, and it earned a 73/100 on Metacritic, both the lowest attributed to a Pixar film.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="box-office">Box office</h3>
<p>In its opening weekend, <em>Cars</em> $60,119,509 in 3,985 theaters in the United States ranking number one at the box office.

<p>According to the Walt Disney Company, five million copies of the DVD were sold in the first two days it was available.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In its first week it sold 6,250,856 units and 15,370,791 units in total ($246,198,859).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike previous Pixar DVD releases, there is no two-disc special edition, and no plans to release one in the future. According to Sara Maher, DVD Production Manager at Pixar, John Lasseter and Pixar were preoccupied with productions like <em><a href="Ratatouille_(film)" title="wikilink">Ratatouille</a></em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Additional extras not seen on the DVD have since been released on the official DVD website.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Mattel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mattel</a>-produced 1/55 <a href="scale_model" title="wikilink">scale</a> Toy Cars were some of the most popular toys of the 2006 Summer Season. Dozens of <a href="List_of_Cars_characters" title="wikilink">characters</a> are represented, with some having multiple versions available. Several stores had trouble keeping the toys in stock, and some models are still difficult to find because of being shipped in lower numbers than other characters. Some online Disney enthusiasts are comparing it to the same shortage that Mattel faced with its <em><a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a></em> line in 1995. On August 14, 2007, the die-cast Sarge car, made between May and July 2007, was recalled due to &quot;impermissible levels of lead&quot; used in the paint.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Another <em>Cars</em> product which followed the Disney-Pixar Cars Die-Cast Line were miniature versions of the <a href="List_of_Cars_characters" title="wikilink">characters</a> which were painted in different colors to represent different events. These are called <a href="Cars_Toons" title="wikilink">Cars Toons</a>.

Mattel has announced that Cars toys will continue through 2008 with the release of at least 80 new vehicles. A 36 car pack called &quot;Motor Speedway of the South&quot; will feature most of the race cars seen during the opening race sequence of the film. (This is also the name for the track race in the film)</p>
<p>Estimates from the <em><a href="New_York_Daily_News" title="wikilink">New York Daily News</a></em> indicate that sales of <em>Cars</em> merchandise two weeks out from the release of the film amounted to US$600Â million.

These ice creams were called &quot;Burnouts&quot;. The naming of the particular product sparked controversy as the name &quot;Burnouts&quot; was believed to have encouraged <a href="street_racing" title="wikilink">street racing</a> and committing burnouts. These acts are illegal and heavy fines and convictions are issued to those committing these acts in Australia. It is unknown as to whether the products have been discontinued.</p>
<p>In Norway, the candy company Nidar produced candy with the characters on the outer packaging and pictures of the characters on the packaging of the assorted candy on the inside. These bags also came with <em>Cars</em> themed tattoos.</p>
