He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition.</p>
<p>Cook published two photographs of the land and described it thus: &quot;The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys. The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high, flat, and covered with a thin sheet ice.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It is now known there is no land at that location and Cook's observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication. Cook's Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of <a href="Axel_Heiberg_Island" title="wikilink">Axel Heiberg Island</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
