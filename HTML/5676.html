<p>As nearby Baltimore grew and local agriculture declined, the Ridgelys found it increasingly difficult to maintain the property. Five of the six parterres were removed and replanted as a grass lawn. Some income was generated by producing cider from the estate's apple orchards and operating a dairy. In 1929, Capt. John Ridgely and his son, John Ridgely Jr., formed the Hampton Development Corporation and sold some of the remaining  of land.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In 1938, John Ridgely, Jr. (1882–1959) became the sixth generation of the family to become master of Hampton.

<p>When the Tea Room was closed by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, officials said they did so because of the potential fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it &quot;may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations,&quot; the Park Service stated.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were &quot;disappointed&quot; by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee&lt;U+2014&gt;which raises money for various projects at Hampton&lt;U+2014&gt;also criticized the decision.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that &quot;The mansion is not going to be the site of any food operation,&quot; but has made no further comment since then.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
