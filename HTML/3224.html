<p><em>Gracie</em> (which won the 2007 &quot;Truly Moving&quot; award <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) takes place in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> in <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a> before <a href="Title_IX" title="wikilink">Title IX</a> (which was passed in <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>) had a chance to take effect <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and when <a href="women&#39;s_football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">women's football (soccer)</a> did not exist. Its central <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a>, <em>Gracie</em> overcomes the loss of her brother by convincing her family and school to allow her to play <a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">varsity soccer</a> on an all-boys team. It is loosely based on the childhood experiences of <a href="Elizabeth_Shue" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Shue</a>.</p>
<p>The novel, <em>Gracie</em> by <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> and <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> author <a href="Suzanne_Weyn" title="wikilink">Suzanne Weyn</a>, was released in June 2007. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>It is 1978 and 15 year old Gracie Bowen (<a href="Carly_Schroeder" title="wikilink">Carly Schroeder</a>), who lives in <a href="South_Orange,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">South Orange, New Jersey</a>, is crazy about <a href="soccer" class="uri" title="wikilink">soccer</a>, as are her three brothers and former soccer star father (<a href="Dermot_Mulroney" title="wikilink">Dermot Mulroney</a>). Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and father in the nightly practices, she is discouraged by everyone except her elder brother, Johnny (<a href="Jesse_Lee_Soffer" title="wikilink">Jesse Lee Soffer</a>).</p>

<p>Tragedy unexpectedly strikes when Johnny, the star of the high school varsity soccer team, is killed in a car accident. Struggling with grief over her family's loss, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father, a former soccer star himself, does not believe that girls should play soccer and tells her that she is neither tough enough nor talented enough to play with the boys team. Her mother, Lindsey Bowen, is a <a href="homemaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">homemaker</a> who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and who fears for Gracie's safety. Lindsey later confesses to Gracie, in discussing gender inequities, that she would have liked to become a <a href="surgeon" class="uri" title="wikilink">surgeon</a> but became a <a href="nurse" class="uri" title="wikilink">nurse</a> instead.</p>
<p>This opposition leads Gracie towards a state of depression and acts of rebellion. She begins to fail in school and to exhibit <a href="promiscuous" class="uri" title="wikilink">promiscuous</a> and angry behavior, all of which serves as a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for her parents. They half-heartedly begin to support her ambitions. Referencing <a href="Title_IX" title="wikilink">Title IX</a>, which had only passed six years prior, Gracie and her family argue that she should be allowed to join the boy's soccer team, since a girl's team did not exist.</p>
<p>Despite further obstacles and setbacks, Gracie continues to persevere.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical background</h2>
<p>The premise of the film rests upon the conflicting expectations of two different <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> generations. As Gracie's parents were most likely both products of what is now referred to as the <a href="Silent_Generation" title="wikilink">Silent Generation</a> (children born between the two World Wars), they would have been raised to adhere to traditional <a href="gender_role" title="wikilink">gender roles</a>. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This would include discouraging a girl from participating in &quot;boys sports&quot; such as soccer as opposed to &quot;girls sports&quot; such as <a href="cheerleading" class="uri" title="wikilink">cheerleading</a> or <a href="gymnastics" class="uri" title="wikilink">gymnastics</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Gracie, on the other hand, came of age during the <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>, when <a href="second-wave_feminism" title="wikilink">new and controversial ideas about gender</a> were being introduced. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, critic for the <em><a href="Atlanta_Journal-Constitution" title="wikilink">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>,</em> noted an additional generation gap between those in the film and those in the audience, many of whom grew up with the <a href="United_States_women&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">United States women's national soccer team</a> (which played its first game in 1985) as a reality:</p>

<p><img src="FIFA_Women&#39;s_World_Cup_2003_-_USA_vs_Canada.jpg" title="fig:2003 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup" alt="2003 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup" width="300" /> Other critics have also noted the multiple generation gaps. Kevin Cahillane observes in the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> that, &quot;this being <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a> (before <a href="Title_IX" title="wikilink">Title IX</a> turned a generation of girls from onlookers into athletes), her desire goes against the wishes of the coach, the principal, the other players and her heartbroken parents.&quot; <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In another article for the <em>New York Times,</em> Jeannette Catsoulis further argues that, &quot;[Gracie] is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked [...] When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer.&quot; <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The film, itself, closes with the following remarks: &quot;Thanks to <a href="Title_IX" title="wikilink">Title IX</a> and brave girls like Gracie, there are over 5 million girls who play soccer in America. Since 1991 the <a href="United_States_women&#39;s_national_soccer_team" title="wikilink">U.S. Women's National team</a> has won Soccer's World Championships four times.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<h3 id="development-and-casting">Development and casting</h3>
<p>The film is loosely based on life events concerning the Shue family. Former <em><a href="Melrose_Place" title="wikilink">Melrose Place</a></em> star, <a href="Andrew_Shue" title="wikilink">Andrew Shue</a> (who developed, produced, and had a small role in the film) initially conceived of it as a story about his late brother William. William was the oldest Shue sibling and was captain of the <a href="Columbia_High_School_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Columbia High School</a> soccer team that won the <a href="New_Jersey_State_Interscholastic_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">New Jersey state championship</a> in <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a>. He died in an accident in <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a>. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As he developed the idea with his brother-in-law (the director of <em><a href="An_Inconvenient_Truth" title="wikilink">An Inconvenient Truth</a></em>, <a href="Davis_Guggenheim" title="wikilink">Davis Guggenheim</a>) the storyline began to shift towards Guggenheim's wife, <a href="Elizabeth_Shue" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Shue</a>, Andrew's older sister. Elizabeth became the model for Gracie and William the model for Johnny. Andrew Shue noted in an interview that,</p>

<p><img src="Elisabeth_Shue_in_February_2006.jpg" title="fig:Elisabeth Shue in February, 2006" alt="Elisabeth Shue in February, 2006" width="225" /> Elisabeth Shue further commented that, &quot;the movie is really what would have happened if I hadn&lt;U+2019&gt;t quit [playing soccer]. I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I&lt;U+2019&gt;d been brave enough.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Andrew, Elizabeth, and their brother John (who was also a producer on the film) along with Guggenheim then engaged in an extensive search to find the right actress to portray fifteen year old Gracie. The search was promoted via the website, <em>findinggracie.com</em>. <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><em>Gracie</em> is a <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a> Critics' Pick.</em> Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis described <em>Gracie</em> as &quot;a familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity [...] &lt;U+201C&gt;Gracie&lt;U+201D&gt; connects the adversity-drama dots &lt;U+2014&gt; the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter &lt;U+2014&gt; with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley&lt;U+2019&gt;s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens.&quot; <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Bill Zwecker of the <em><a href="Chicago_Sun_Times" title="wikilink">Chicago Sun Times</a></em>, gave the film three out of four stars stating that, &quot;it's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call &quot;old-fashioned&quot; values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old- fashioned? Not at all.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Carrie Rickey of the <em><a href="The_Philadelphia_Inquirer" title="wikilink">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a></em> gave the film three out of four stars and declared that, &quot; <em>Gracie</em> is a winner.&quot; <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Owen Gleiberman of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> gave the film a &quot;C&quot; and stated that, &quot;in 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel &lt;U+2014&gt; it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for [...] Gracie to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie as processed as an <a href="after_school_special" title="wikilink">after-school special</a>? You miss the knockabout edge of <em><a href="Bend_It_Like_Beckham" title="wikilink">Bend It Like Beckham</a></em> &lt;U+2014&gt; though the ending, in its <a href="Ivan_Pavlov" title="wikilink">Pavlovian</a> sports-flick way, pumps you up.&quot; <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Scott Tobias of the <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> gave the film a &quot;B&quot; and argued that, &quot;though <em>Gracie</em> fashions Shue's story into ready-made inspirational formula, it's nonetheless vivid in its particulars, from the <a href="Decade_nostalgia" title="wikilink">looks and sounds</a> of <a href="1970s" title="wikilink">late-'70s</a> New Jersey to the portrait of a soccer-driven family reformed by loss.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Lael Loewenstein of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> argued that <em>Gracie</em> is &quot;an earnest, well-acted, poignant drama that nevertheless runs afoul of <a href="List_of_sports_clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s#Sports_film_clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" title="wikilink">sports movie clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The film received a 59% rating from <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (51 <em>fresh</em> and 35 <em>rotten</em> reviews). <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
