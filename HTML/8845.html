<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was originally named Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m kommunale idrettsplass (&quot;Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m Municipal Sports Place&quot;). Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m SK was the main football tenant from the opening until 1951, when they opened &lt;U+00C5&gt;r&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen Stadion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The original athletics stadium opened in 1953, located at the same place as the current athletics stadium. Minerva arranged the first tournament on 16 June 1954. Subsequently a <a href="velodrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">velodrome</a> was installed outside the running track. A municipal grant of 5,000 <a href="Norwegian_krone" title="wikilink">Norwegian krone</a> (NOK) allowed a <a href="steeplechase_(athletics)" title="wikilink">steeplechase</a> obstacle to be installed in 1959. A cage for <a href="discus_throw" title="wikilink">discus throw</a> and <a href="hammer_throw" title="wikilink">hammer throw</a> was installed on the current artificial turf pitch in 1970.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The athletics venue suffered with drainage problems, and from the 1970s it was no longer used for competitions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in <a href="Oslo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oslo</a> and <a href="UKI_Arena" title="wikilink">Jessheim stadion</a> in <a href="Ullensaker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ullensaker</a>. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay all-weather running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK 2 million for all-weather running track, but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on <a href="Skedsmo_Church" title="wikilink">Skedsmo Church</a>. No further grants were issued for the stadium.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m SK took initiative to convert one of the gravel pitches to artificial turf. The proposal also saw the installation of <a href="floodlights_(sport)" title="wikilink">floodlights</a> and <a href="under-soil_heating" title="wikilink">under-soil heating</a>. The new field cost NOK 9 million, which was covered by LSK, <a href="Norsk_Tipping" title="wikilink">betting grants</a> and the municipality. Construction started in August 2004 and was completed in November.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The pitch located behind Skedsmohallen was converted to a throwing venue in 2005.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Ahead of the <a href="Norwegian_local_elections,_2003" title="wikilink">2003 municipal elections</a>, the <a href="Labour_Party_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> mayor candidates for the municipalities of Skedsmo, <a href="R&lt;U+00E6&gt;lingen" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00E6&gt;lingen</a> and <a href="L&lt;U+00F8&gt;renskog" class="uri" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00F8&gt;renskog</a>, <a href="Andreas_Hamnes" title="wikilink">Andreas Hamnes</a>, <a href="Terje_Granerud" title="wikilink">Terje Granerud</a> and <a href="&lt;U+00C5&gt;ge_Tovan" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C5&gt;ge Tovan</a>, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for <a href="Nedre_Romerike" title="wikilink">Nedre Romerike</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The proposal was followed up by the three atheltics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;mmen IF and L&lt;U+00F8&gt;renskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m idrettspark because of the availability of existing <a href="utilities" class="uri" title="wikilink">utilities</a>, parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the investment costs.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the process, <a href="Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;mmen_stadion" title="wikilink">Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;mmen stadion</a> was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive <a href="artificial_turf" title="wikilink">artificial turf</a> and <a href="Marikollen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marikollen</a> was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in L&lt;U+00F8&gt;renskog was deemed unsuitable.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The choice of Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Grants were issued from the municipalities in 2005, the size of which was determined by the population of each municipality. <a href="Multiconsult" class="uri" title="wikilink">Multiconsult</a> was hired to design the venue and construction started on 28 June 2006. Earthworks were completed by November and asphalting started on 16 May 2007. The all-weather surface was completed on 13 June and technical installations were completed by mid-August. The new venue was inaugurated on 1 September 2007.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It cost NOK 28.6 million, of which NOK 15.9 million were paid for by the municipalities in ratio of their population. The rest was financed through a combination of betting grants, <a href="value_added_tax" title="wikilink">value added tax</a> compensation and volunteer work.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006, the municipality approved Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m SK's plans to build an indoor football pitch.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The hall was inaugurated on 11 October 2007 and cost NOK 62 million.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 2009, Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host the <a href="UEFA_Euro_2016" title="wikilink">UEFA Euro 2016</a>. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m. One of three potential locations was at Lillestr&lt;U+00F8&gt;m idrettspark. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
