<p><strong>William Harold Ponsford</strong> <small><a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">MBE</a></small> (19 October 1900 – 6 April 1991) was an Australian <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a>, the only player to twice break the world record for the <a href="List_of_first-class_cricket_records#Highest_individual_score_-_progression_of_record_since_1820" title="wikilink">highest individual score</a> in <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class cricket</a>. Predominantly playing as an <a href="Batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">opening batsman</a>, he formed a successful and long-lived <a href="partnership_(cricket)" title="wikilink">partnership</a> <a href="Batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">opening the batting</a> for <a href="Victorian_Bushrangers" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> and <a href="Australia_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a> with <a href="Bill_Woodfull" title="wikilink">Bill Woodfull</a>, his friend and state and national captain. Aside from <a href="Brian_Lara" title="wikilink">Brian Lara</a>, he is the only man to score <a href="List_of_first-class_cricket_quadruple_centuries" title="wikilink">400 runs in an innings</a> on two occasions. Ponsford holds the Australian record for a partnership in <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test cricket</a>, set in 1934 in combination with <a href="Don_Bradman" title="wikilink">Don Bradman</a>—the man who broke many of Ponsford's other individual records.</p>
<p>Despite being heavily built, Ponsford was quick on his feet and renowned as one of the finest ever players of <a href="spin_bowling" title="wikilink">spin bowling</a>. His bat, much heavier than the norm and nicknamed &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, allowed him to <a href="batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots" title="wikilink">drive</a> powerfully and he possessed a strong <a href="List_of_cricket_terms#C" title="wikilink">cut shot</a>. However, critics questioned his ability against <a href="fast_bowling" title="wikilink">fast bowling</a>, and the hostile <a href="bouncer_(cricket)" title="wikilink">short-pitched</a> English bowling in the <a href="Bodyline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bodyline</a> series of 1932–33 was a contributing factor in his early retirement from cricket a year and a half later.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ponsford also represented his state and country in <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, and credited the sport with improving his cricketing skills.</p>
<p>Ponsford was a shy and taciturn man. After retiring from cricket, he went to some lengths to avoid interaction with the public. He spent over three decades working for the <a href="Melbourne_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, where he had some responsibility for the operations of the <a href="Melbourne_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG), the scene of many of his great performances with the bat. In 1981 the Northern Stand at the MCG was renamed the WH Ponsford Stand in his honour, and in 2005 a statue of him was installed outside the pavilion gates. In recognition of his contributions as a player, Ponsford was one of the ten initial inductees into the <a href="Australian_Cricket_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>The son of William and Elizabeth (<a href="Married_and_maiden_names" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> Best), Ponsford was born in the Melbourne suburb of <a href="Fitzroy_North,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Fitzroy North</a> on 19 October 1900.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His father was a postman whose family had emigrated from <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a> to <a href="Bendigo,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Bendigo, Victoria</a> to work in the mines during the <a href="Victorian_gold_rush" title="wikilink">1850s gold rush</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His mother was also born in the goldfields, at <a href="Guildford,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Guildford</a>, before moving to Melbourne with her father, a <a href="Crown_Land" title="wikilink">Crown Lands</a> <a href="bailiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">bailiff</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Ponsford grew up on Newry St in Fitzroy North, and attended the nearby Alfred Crescent School, which stood beside the <a href="Edinburgh_Gardens,_Melbourne" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Gardens</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Ponsford learnt the rudiments of cricket from his uncle Cuthbert Best—a former club player for Fitzroy.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He had the best <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting</a> and <a href="bowling_average" title="wikilink">bowling averages</a> for his school team in 1913, 1914 and 1915 and eventually rose to the captaincy.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His local <a href="grade_cricket" title="wikilink">grade</a> club, <a href="Fitzroy_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Fitzroy</a>, awarded Ponsford a medallion—presented by the <a href="City_of_Fitzroy" title="wikilink">local mayor</a>—for being his school's outstanding cricketer in the 1913–14 and 1914–15 seasons.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The medallion was awarded along with an honorary membership of the club, and Ponsford trained enthusiastically, running from school to the nearby <a href="Brunswick_Street_Oval" title="wikilink">Brunswick Street Oval</a> in the Edinburgh Gardens to practise in the <a href="cricket_nets" title="wikilink">nets</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Leslie_Cody" title="wikilink">Les Cody</a>, the general secretary of Fitzroy Cricket Club and a <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class cricketer</a> with <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and Victoria, was Ponsford's first cricketing role model.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 1914, Ponsford completed his schooling and earned a qualifying certificate, which allowed him to continue his education at a high school should he wish.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He instead chose to attend a private training college, Hassett's, to study for the Bank Clerk's exam. Ponsford passed the exam and commenced employment with the <a href="State_Bank_of_Victoria" title="wikilink">State Savings Bank</a> at the <a href="Elizabeth_Street,_Melbourne" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Street</a> head office in early 1916.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In May 1916, the Ponsford family moved to Orrong St in <a href="Elsternwick,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Elsternwick</a>, a wealthier part of Melbourne.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Ponsford played with Fitzroy in a minor league for the remainder of the 1915–16 season, but under the geographical &quot;zoning&quot; rules in place for club cricket, he was required to transfer to <a href="St_Kilda_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">St Kilda Cricket Club</a> in the following season.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="early-record-breaking">Early record breaking</h3>
<p>The <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> and the creation of the <a href="First_Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">First Australian Imperial Force</a> led to a shortage of players available for cricket. As a result, Ponsford was called up to make his first-grade debut for St Kilda during the 1916–17 season, just one week before his sixteenth birthday. This match was against his old club Fitzroy, and was played at the familiar Brunswick Street Oval. The young Ponsford's shot-making lacked power, and after making twelve <a href="single_(cricket)" title="wikilink">singles</a>, he was <a href="bowled" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowled</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He played ten matches in his first season with the St Kilda <a href="11_(number)#in_sports" title="wikilink">First XI</a> and averaged 9.30 runs per <a href="innings" class="uri" title="wikilink">innings</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By the 1918–19 season, Ponsford would top the club batting averages with an average of 33 He also topped the bowling averages, taking 10 wickets at an average of 16.50 runs per wicket with his <a href="leg_spin" title="wikilink">leg spin</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite failing to score a <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a> for his club side (something he did not rectify until the 1923–24 season), Ponsford was called up to represent <a href="Victorian_Bushrangers" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> against the visiting <a href="English_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21" title="wikilink">England team</a> in February 1921—his first-class cricket debut.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> His selection was controversial; the leading personality in Victorian cricket and <a href="Australian_national_cricket_captains" title="wikilink">national captain</a>, &quot;The Big Ship&quot; <a href="Warwick_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Warwick Armstrong</a>, had been dropped. Armstrong's omission sparked a series of angry public meetings protesting against the perceived persecution of Armstrong by administrators.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> While making his way to the <a href="Melbourne_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG) for the match, Ponsford had to walk through demonstrators carrying placards that denounced his selection at the expense of Armstrong.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Without Armstrong, the Victorians were comfortably beaten by <a href="Johnny_Douglas" title="wikilink">Johnny Douglas</a>'s English team by <a href="result_(cricket)" title="wikilink">seven wickets</a>. <a href="Batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">Batting down the order</a>, Ponsford made six in the first innings and 19 in the second innings.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Later that month, Ponsford made his maiden first-class century, scoring 162 against <a href="Tasmanian_Tigers" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a> at the <a href="NTCA_Ground" title="wikilink">NTCA Ground</a> in <a href="Launceston,_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Launceston</a>, despite batting low in the order, at number eight.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Ponsford was named captain of a Victorian side made of up of promising youngsters, to play against Tasmania at the MCG on 2 – 5 February 1923. In this, only his third first-class match, Ponsford broke the world record for the highest individual innings score at that level, scoring 429 runs and batting for nearly eight hours.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Along the way, he broke Armstrong's record for the highest score for Victoria (250), before surpassing former England captain <a href="Archie_MacLaren" title="wikilink">Archie MacLaren</a>'s world record individual score of 424.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The team score of 1,059 was also a new record for a first-class innings—an impromptu paint job was needed to show the score on a board that was not designed to display a four-figure total.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Governor_General_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Governor General of Australia</a>, <a href="Henry_Forster,_1st_Baron_Forster" title="wikilink">Lord Forster</a>, visited the dressing rooms after the day's play to congratulate Ponsford personally. <a href="Telegraphy" title="wikilink">Cables</a> from around the world applauded the new record-holder, including one from <a href="Frank_Woolley" title="wikilink">Frank Woolley</a>, whose 305<a href="List_of_cricket_terms#N" title="wikilink">*</a> was the previous highest score against Tasmania.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The former world record holder MacLaren was not so forthcoming. MacLaren thought that the two teams were both short of first-class standard and therefore the record should not be recognised. However, an agreement made in 1908 confirmed that matches against Tasmania should be categorised as first-class matches. An exchange of letters between MacLaren and the <a href="Victorian_Cricket_Association" title="wikilink">Victorian Cricket Association</a>, and speculation over possible political motives followed in the popular press, but the famous <em><a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></em> recognised and published Ponsford's score as the record.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Selected for his first <a href="Sheffield_Shield" title="wikilink">Sheffield Shield</a> match, against <a href="Southern_Redbacks" title="wikilink">South Australia</a> three weeks after his record breaking innings, Ponsford—still batting down the order, at number five—made 108.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The South Australian (and former Australian) captain <a href="Clem_Hill" title="wikilink">Clem Hill</a> watched Ponsford bat and commented, &quot;[Ponsford] is young and full of promise; in fact, since <a href="James_Mackay_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Jim Mackay</a>, the brilliant New South Welshman, I think he is the best.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 1923–24 Ponsford continued to score at a heavy rate. Against <a href="Queensland_Bulls" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> in December, he made 248 and shared in a <a href="partnership_(cricket)" title="wikilink">partnership</a> of 456 runs with <a href="Edgar_Mayne" title="wikilink">Edgar Mayne</a>—the highest <a href="batting_order_(cricket)" title="wikilink">first wicket</a> partnership by an Australian pair to this day.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Later that season, he scored a pair of centuries against arch-rivals <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, accumulating 110 in each innings.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="test-debut-and-more-records">Test debut and more records</h3>
<p>Ponsford broke into international cricket in the 1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25 season. After scoring 166 for Victoria against South Australia, and 81 for an <a href="Australian_XI" title="wikilink">Australian XI</a> against the touring <a href="English_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25" title="wikilink">English team</a>, he was selected for the first Test against England at the <a href="Sydney_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> (SCG).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Batting at number three, Ponsford joined his captain <a href="Herbie_Collins" title="wikilink">Herbie Collins</a> at the wicket after the dismissal of opening batsman <a href="Warren_Bardsley" title="wikilink">Warren Bardsley</a>. Although Ponsford initially struggled against the &quot;baffling&quot; <a href="swing_bowling" title="wikilink">swing bowling</a> of <a href="Maurice_Tate" title="wikilink">Maurice Tate</a>, the experienced Collins was confident enough to <a href="List_of_cricket_terms#F" title="wikilink">farm the strike</a> during Tate's initial spell and Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on his Test debut.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Ponsford later said &quot;I was most grateful for Herbie taking [Tate's bowling] until I was settled in. I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He scored 128 in the second Test at Melbourne;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> thereby becoming the first batsman to score centuries in his first two Tests.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Ponsford played in all five Tests of the series, scoring 468 runs at an average of 46.80.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>There were no international visitors to Australia in the 1925–26 season, so Ponsford was able to play a full season for Victoria. He scored 701 runs at an average of 63.72, including three centuries, making him the fourth highest runscorer for the season.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> At the end of the season, Ponsford was chosen for the <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1926" title="wikilink">Australian team to tour England in 1926</a>. He was one of the younger players in the squad; 9 of the 15 players were over the age of 36.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> He made a good start to the tour, scoring a century (110*) in his first innings at <a href="Lord&#39;s_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Lord's</a> against the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> in May.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Unfortunately for Ponsford, <a href="tonsillitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tonsillitis</a> caused him to miss three weeks of cricket in June and he was not chosen for the first three Tests of the English summer.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He returned for the fourth and fifth Tests. The fifth Test was the only match that saw a result—an English victory—which meant that the hosts won the series and the Ashes one Test to nil.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> For the tour, Ponsford made 901 runs at an average of 40.95, including three centuries. <em>Wisden</em> described Ponsford's performances for the season as &quot;something of a disappointment&quot; but noted that &quot;he batted well enough on occasion to demonstrate his undoubted abilities&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In the season following his return to Australia, Ponsford continued to make large scores. He started the season by hitting 214 runs (out of a Victoria team total of 315) against South Australia at the <a href="Adelaide_Oval" title="wikilink">Adelaide Oval</a> and followed this with 151 at the MCG against Queensland.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In his next match, against New South Wales, Ponsford again rewrote the record books. Ponsford scored 352 runs, 334 of them in a single day, and helped Victoria to an innings total of 1,107, which remains the <a href="List_of_first-class_cricket_records#Highest_totals" title="wikilink">highest team total in first-class cricket</a>, breaking Victoria's own record set four years earlier.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> After Ponsford played the ball back on to his <a href="stumps" class="uri" title="wikilink">stumps</a> to be dismissed <a href="bowled" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowled</a>, he then turned to look at his broken <a href="wicket#Set_of_stumps" title="wikilink">wicket</a> and famously said, &quot;Cripes, I am unlucky.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> For the season, Ponsford went on to score 1,229 runs at an average of 122.90, including six centuries and two half-centuries from only ten innings.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>After failing in the fourth Test, Ponsford was again dropped. The hostile barrage of <a href="bouncer_(cricket)" title="wikilink">short-pitched bowling</a> had a major impact on Ponsford's technique and career.

<p>In the fourth Test at Headingley, Bradman joined Ponsford at the fall of the third wicket when the Australians had scored only 39 runs (39/3). By the time Ponsford was dismissed <a href="hit_wicket" title="wikilink">hit wicket</a> for 181, Australia were 427/4; the partnership had yielded 388 runs.

<p>With the series locked at 1–1, the fifth and deciding Test at <a href="The_Oval" title="wikilink">The Oval</a> saw an even larger partnership between Bradman and Ponsford. The pair added 451 runs for the second wicket in an Australian total of 701 runs.

<p>Upon their return to Australia, a <a href="testimonial_match" title="wikilink">testimonial match</a> was arranged on behalf of the two Victorian opening batsmen, Woodfull and Ponsford. Woodfull—the senior member of the partnership—had announced his retirement from first-class cricket before returning from England and the press had speculated that Ponsford would succeed him as <a href="captain_(cricket)" title="wikilink">captain</a> of Victoria.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Walking out to bat in the match, the pair were cheered by the crowd to the strains of &quot;<a href="For_He&#39;s_a_Jolly_Good_Fellow" title="wikilink">For He's a Jolly Good Fellow</a>&quot;.

<p>During the match, to the surprise of the public, the press and his team mates, Ponsford announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the relatively young age of 34.

<p>For services to cricket, Ponsford was made a <a href="Member_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in the 1982 <a href="New_Year_Honours" title="wikilink">New Year Honours</a> announced on 31 December 1981.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Ponsford was one of the ten inaugural inductees when the <a href="Australian_Cricket_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a> was launched in 1996.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> In 2000, Ponsford and <a href="Arthur_Morris" title="wikilink">Arthur Morris</a> were chosen to open the batting for the <a href="Cricket_Australia" title="wikilink">Australian Cricket Board</a>'s <a href="Australian_Cricket_Board_Team_of_the_Century" title="wikilink">Team of the Century</a>, a theoretical selection of the best team of Australian cricketers of the 20th century.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> In 2001, Ponsford was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club <a href="Team_of_the_Century" title="wikilink">Team of the Century</a>.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1986 the Northern Stand of the Melbourne Cricket Ground was renamed the &quot;Ponsford Stand&quot;. Ponsford was described by his son as being &quot;tickled pink&quot; by the honour, but that he would only agree to the renaming if he was not required to participate in any public appearance or media interview.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> As part of the ongoing modernisation of the MCG the Ponsford Stand was torn down; the new stand was completed in 2004 and again named in his honour.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> A statue of the cricketer was installed outside the Ponsford Stand in 1995—one of a series in place around the stadium commemorating Australia's sporting heroes.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="style-and-personality">Style and personality</h3>
<p>Answering to the nickname of &quot;Puddin'&quot;, Ponsford was a thickset man, weighing in at around  during his playing career.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Despite this, he was known for his quick footwork, and was regarded as an excellent player of <a href="spin_bowling" title="wikilink">spin bowling</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Ponsford was noted for his ability to maintain intense levels of concentration for extended periods.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> He possessed a strong <a href="batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots" title="wikilink">cut shot</a> and he <a href="batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots" title="wikilink">drove</a> through <a href="Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations" title="wikilink">mid off</a> powerfully, although critics noted that his <a href="backlift" class="uri" title="wikilink">backlift</a> was not completely straight.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> He had a tendency to shuffle too far to the off; this exposed his <a href="leg_stump" title="wikilink">leg stump</a> and he was <a href="bowled" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowled</a> behind his legs on six occasions in Tests against England. However, <a href="Ray_Robinson_(cricket_writer)" title="wikilink">Ray Robinson</a> felt that &quot;no bowler could have got a marble, much less a [cricket] ball between his bat and his left leg.&quot;<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Fingleton wrote, &quot;He crouched a little at the crease ... he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball, and his feet were so eager to be on the move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled. This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. I never saw a better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said &quot;There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal [Ponsford]?&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Robinson described Ponsford as the &quot;founder of total batting, the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> The New South Wales and Australian bowler <a href="Arthur_Mailey" title="wikilink">Arthur Mailey</a> later said that &quot;I don't think it was the rungetting Ponny enjoyed so much as the bowlers' discomfort, especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales.&quot;<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed &quot;Big Bertha&quot;. Opposition players sometimes joked that Ponsford's bat was larger than allowed under the <a href="laws_of_cricket#Equipment_and_laying_out_the_pitch" title="wikilink">laws of cricket</a> and indeed in one match in Sydney, it was found to be slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that &quot;if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could tell he was heading for his second hundred&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> When volunteering for service with the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, &quot;What colour did [the ball] look to you after it was worn?&quot; Ponsford replied, &quot;I never noticed its colour, only its size.&quot;<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as <a href="Color_blindness#Classification_of_color_deficiencies" title="wikilink">protanopia</a>, a form of <a href="dichromacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dichromacy</a> in which red appears dark.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Ponsford did not enjoy batting on <a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">rain-affected wickets</a>. When on tour his team mates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely &quot;Did Ponny wake during the night?&quot;—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the &quot;<a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">sticky</a>&quot; in the morning.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>Ponsford was a shy person, on the field and off. Robinson wrote that Ponsford &quot;was so reserved that you had to know him for three years or the duration of a Test tour before his reticence relaxed.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Similarly, when photographed Ponsford would hang his head so his cap would cover most of his face.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> This shyness intensified after his retirement. He would often walk along laneways to his work at the MCC, rather than be recognised on the way to the train station. While on the train, he would cover his face with the newspaper.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> At work, he disliked interaction with the public and would direct staff to advise visitors that he was not in, despite often being clearly in view.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Bill O'Reilly said of Ponsford, &quot;He spoke rarely and even then only if he could improve on silence.&quot;<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Nonetheless he was popular with his team mates and was said to have a droll sense of humour.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
