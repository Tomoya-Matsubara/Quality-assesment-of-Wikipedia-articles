<p><strong>Johnny Gioeli</strong> ( ; born October 5, 1967) is an American <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> singer. Originally lead singer of the band <a href="Hardline_(band)" title="wikilink">Hardline</a>, he is also currently the vocalist of <a href="Crush_40" title="wikilink">Crush 40</a> and German guitarist <a href="Axel_Rudi_Pell" title="wikilink">Axel Rudi Pell</a>'s band.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Johnny's musical career began in the early '80s after forming the band Phaze with his older brother, Joey. The band underwent reform and he started drumming with the band Killerhit in 1983 at the age of 16?. Sharing vocal duties with Joey the four-piece act hit the East Coast club circuit with an enormous amount of success, earning enough by 1987 to purchase their own lighting rig, truck and tour bus (purchased from <a href="Jimmy_Buffett" title="wikilink">Jimmy Buffett</a>).</p>
<p>Re-locating to Hollywood, Killerhit hooked up with <a href="Poison_(American_band)" title="wikilink">Poison's</a> <a href="Bret_Michaels" title="wikilink">Bret Michaels</a>. The singer gave them his former publicist Debra Rosner's number who instantly became the band's manager. Realizing the need for a front man, Johnny vacated the drum stool for center stage, Las Vegas native Darek Thomas Cava taking his place behind the drum kit. Soon after, the band realized there was not a single blonde among them, and changed their name to the more appropriate Brunette. The band broke The Doors and <a href="Van_Halen" title="wikilink">Van Halen's</a> single-weekend attendance records on the <a href="Sunset_Strip" title="wikilink">Sunset Strip</a> in Hollywood CA. Their sensation soon brought attention and admiration to the recording industry. They were courted by top record executives for months. The band had built a loyal worldwide fan base. Differences began to develop in the Brunette camp before a recording deal could be secured, and the band decided to call it quits in 1991. Gioeli then started working with his brother Joey on songs for an album they were going to call Brothers. However, <a href="Neal_Schon" title="wikilink">Neal Schon</a>, <a href="Journey_(band)" title="wikilink">Journey</a>'s guitarist (who was dating their sister at the time) met with them and asked if he could play with them, and they agreed. Then, in 1992, they released their first effort, entitled <em><a href="Double_Eclipse" title="wikilink">Double Eclipse</a></em>, and called themselves <a href="Hardline_(band)" title="wikilink">Hardline</a>, which was moderately successful but not enough to get into the mainstream, especially considering its post-Nirvana release. After this they began writing songs for a second album but once again called it quits while recording the songs due to troubles with their manager and Neal Schon. Johnny had all but disappeared from the music scene until, in 1998, German guitarist <a href="Axel_Rudi_Pell" title="wikilink">Axel Rudi Pell</a> found himself in need of a vocalist after the departure of <a href="Jeff_Scott_Soto" title="wikilink">Jeff Scott Soto</a>. Axel had admired Johnny for a long time, stating he always thought Johnny's vocals would go well with his music. Axel eventually found means of contacting Johnny and flew him to Germany to record vocals for his <em><a href="Oceans_of_Time" title="wikilink">Oceans of Time</a></em> CD, which up to date has been considered as one of the best <a href="Axel_Rudi_Pell" title="wikilink">Axel Rudi Pell</a> albums. He is now the permanent lead vocalist of the band and shows no signs of leaving.</p>
<p>He also participated in Michael Voss's compilation album titled <em>Voices Of Rock - MMVII</em>, released the 07.20.2007 on which he performed the song &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot;. In 1994, Johnny also collaborated with musician <a href="Doug_Aldrich" title="wikilink">Doug Aldrich</a>, who had performed live as Brunette's guest guitarist, and performed the vocals for the song &quot;Face Down&quot; featured on Aldrich's <em>Highcentered</em> album, later included again on Aldrich's 2002 album <em>Alter Ego</em>.</p>

<p>After considerable success of their debut CD, <a href="Double_Eclipse" title="wikilink">Double Eclipse</a>, the band was dissolved for ten years during which Johnny and his brother followed a career in internet business. After he met with further success in Axel Rudi Pell's band, Johnny and his band Hardline returned with a new lineup to release their second album entitled <em><a href="II_(Hardline_album)" title="wikilink">II</a></em>, released in 2002, followed by the live CD/DVD in 2003, named <em><a href="Live_at_the_Gods_Festival_2002" title="wikilink">Live at the Gods Festival 2002</a></em>. Their third album, <em><a href="Leaving_the_End_Open" title="wikilink">Leaving the End Open</a></em>, was released April 17, 2009. <a href="http://www.rockreport.be/releases.asp">1</a> On December 22, 2011, Gioeli confirmed, via Frontiers Records official site, that he and Italian producer and keyboard player Alessandro Del Vecchio would release Hardline's fourth studio album <em><a href="Danger_Zone_(Hardline_album)" title="wikilink">Danger Zone</a></em> on May 18, 2012, yet again with a new lineup.</p>

They&#39;ve been writing and performing songs inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise." /> In addition to being a vocalist for two bands, he has also been working with <a href="video_game_composer" title="wikilink">video game composer</a> and musician <a href="Jun_Senoue" title="wikilink">Jun Senoue</a> and has delivered his vocals in the Sons Of Angels CD; <em><a href="Thrill_of_the_Feel" title="wikilink">Thrill of the Feel</a></em>, released in 2000. The band has since changed their name to <a href="Crush_40" title="wikilink">Crush 40</a>. They have written and performed several songs from the <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a> video game series produced by <a href="Sega" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sega</a> and <a href="Sonic_Team" title="wikilink">Sonic Team</a>, such as the theme tune &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; from <a href="Sonic_Heroes" title="wikilink">the game of the same name</a>, a bright, <a href="melodic" class="uri" title="wikilink">melodic</a> song and in contrast to &quot;What I'm Made Of...&quot;, a distinctly dark, energetic <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> song with metal sensibilities for the final battle against <a href="Metal_Sonic" title="wikilink">Metal Sonic</a>. He was also the vocalist for the songs &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, the main theme of <em><a href="Sonic_Adventure" title="wikilink">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, &quot;Live and Learn&quot;, the main theme of <em><a href="Sonic_Adventure_2" title="wikilink">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>, &quot;I Am... All Of Me&quot;, the main theme of <em><a href="Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>, &quot;Never Turn Back&quot;, the ending theme from the same game, and &quot;Knight of the Wind&quot;, the main theme of <em><a href="Sonic_and_the_Black_Knight" title="wikilink">Sonic and the Black Knight</a></em> as well as the ending theme &quot;Live Life&quot;. Additionally, Gioeli has worked with Senoue to produce a cover of Steve Conte's &quot;Seven Rings in Hand&quot;, which was featured exclusively on the Japan-only release <em><a href="True_Blue:_The_Best_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog" title="wikilink">True Blue: The Best of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>. He also wrote the chorus for the <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(2006_video_game)" title="wikilink"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a> theme song &quot;<a href="His_World" title="wikilink">His World</a>&quot; and recorded a version of the song with Crush 40 (featured as a bonus track on the game's official soundtrack). Because of his close ties musically to the video game series, Gioeli is often considered by fans to be the singing voice of <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="wikilink">Sonic</a>.</p>
<p>Gioeli provided his vocals on the soundtrack to the game <em>Sonic and the Black Knight</em> on the tracks &quot;Fight the Knight&quot; and &quot;Through the Fire&quot;. In October 2008, Gioeli and Senoue took the stage at the <a href="Tokyo_Game_Show" title="wikilink">Tokyo Game Show</a> to perform some of their most popular <em>Sonic</em>-based songs in front of a live audience for the first time. Gioeli and Senoue have since created a YouTube account and uploaded video footage of the event.</p>
<p>In 2009, a new Crush 40 album was released entitled: <em><a href="The_Best_of_Crush_40_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Super_Sonic_Songs" title="wikilink">The Best of Crush 40 &lt;U+2013&gt; Super Sonic Songs</a></em>. This <a href="compilation_album" title="wikilink">compilation album</a> contains most of the band's <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> releases as well as a mixture of old tracks from the <em>NASCAR '98</em> arcade game and some brand new songs including a cover of &quot;Un-gravitify&quot;, the main theme of <em><a href="Sonic_Riders:_Zero_Gravity" title="wikilink">Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity</a></em>, a cover of <a href="The_Cult" title="wikilink">the Cult's</a> &quot;<a href="Fire_Woman" title="wikilink">Fire Woman</a>&quot;, and an original ballad entitled &quot;Is It You&quot;. The album also contains four remixed tracks.</p>
<p>In 2010, Gioeli performed with Jun Senoue as Crush 40 at the 2010 <a href="Summer_of_Sonic" title="wikilink">Summer of Sonic</a> convention in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> on August 7, 2010. It was Crush 40's first full-length performance and their first performance outside of Japan.</p>
<p>In 2012, the band performed at two conventions. The first one is at the Summer of Sonic in <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a> and at the Sonic Boom in <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> during the <a href="San_Diego_Comic-Con_International" title="wikilink">Comic Con</a>. The band has released their first live album on October 3, 2012 entitled <em><a href="Crush_40#Live!" title="wikilink">Live!</a></em>, which featured songs from their concerts in Tokyo back in March.</p>
<p>In 2013, the band performed in <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a> for the Sonic Boom 2013 event.</p>
