<p>The <strong>Apalachee Massacre</strong> was a series of brutal raids by <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">English</a> colonists from the <a href="Province_of_Carolina" title="wikilink">Province of Carolina</a> and their Indian allies against a largely pacific population of <a href="Apalachee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apalachee</a> Indians in northern <a href="Spanish_Florida" title="wikilink">Spanish Florida</a> that took place during <a href="Queen_Anne&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">Queen Anne's War</a> in 1704. Against limited Spanish and Indian resistance, a thriving <a href="Spanish_missions_in_Florida" title="wikilink">network of missions</a> was destroyed; most of the population was either killed, captured, fled to larger Spanish and French outposts, or voluntarily joined the English.</p>
<p>The only major event of former Carolina Governor <a href="James_Moore_(South_Carolina_politician)" title="wikilink">James Moore's</a> expedition was the <strong>Battle of Ayubale</strong>, which marked the only large-scale resistance to the English raids. Significant numbers of the Apalachee, unhappy with the conditions they lived in under the Spanish, simply abandoned their towns and joined Moore's expedition. They were resettled near the <a href="Savannah_River" title="wikilink">Savannah</a> and <a href="Ocmulgee_River" title="wikilink">Ocmulgee</a> Rivers, where conditions were only slightly better.</p>
<p>Moore's raiding expedition was preceded and followed by other raiding activity that was principally conducted by English-allied <a href="Creek_people" title="wikilink">Creeks</a>. The cumulative effect of these raids, conducted between 1702 and 1709, was to depopulate Spanish Florida beyond the confines of St. Augustine and <a href="Pensacola,_Florida" title="wikilink">Pensacola</a>, destroying missions beyond the range of Moore's expedition.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>English and Spanish colonization efforts in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century. The founding in 1670 by the English of Charles Town (present-day <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston, South Carolina</a>) in the recently-established (1663) <a href="Province_of_Carolina" title="wikilink">Province of Carolina</a> heightened tensions with the Spanish in <a href="Spanish_Florida" title="wikilink">Florida</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Traders, raiders, and slavers from the new province penetrated into Florida, leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1700, Carolina's governor, <a href="Joseph_Blake_(governor)" title="wikilink">Joseph Blake</a>, threatened the Spanish that English claims to <a href="Pensacola,_Florida" title="wikilink">Pensacola</a>, established by the Spanish in 1698, would be enforced.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Blake's death later that year interrupted these plans, and he was replaced in 1702 by <a href="James_Moore_(South_Carolina_politician)" title="wikilink">James Moore</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="la-florida">La Florida</h3>
<p>The Spanish population of Florida at the time was fairly small compared to that of the nearby English colonies. Since its founding in the 16th century, the Spanish had set up a <a href="Spanish_missions_in_Florida" title="wikilink">network of missions</a> whose primary purpose was to pacify the local Indian population and convert them to <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a>. In the <a href="Apalachee_Province" title="wikilink">Apalachee Province</a> (roughly present-day western Florida and southwestern <a href="Georgia_(U._S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>) there were 14 mission communities with a total population in 1680 of about 8,000. Many but not all of these communities were populated by the <a href="Apalachee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apalachee</a>; others were from other tribes that had migrated southward to the area.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By the early 18th century Apalachee had become a major source of food for the principal towns of <a href="St._Augustine,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="Pensacola,_Florida" title="wikilink">Pensacola</a>, which were situated near lands not well suited for agriculture.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The native populations of Florida were not entirely happy with Spanish rule; there had been several uprisings against the Spanish in the 17th century.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Indians were often forced to do work for the Spanish military garrisons and plantation owners, including the labor of hauling goods to the St. Augustine, about  away. These policies, and mistreatment by overbearing Spanish masters led some Apalachees to flee to the English in Carolina.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Spanish policy also forbade Indians the possession of <a href="musket" title="wikilink">muskets</a>, which made them dependent on the Spanish for protection against the English-armed <a href="Creek_people" title="wikilink">Creeks</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="raids-before-1704">Raids before 1704</h2>
<p>News of the war's formal opening arrived in 1702, and Governor Moore convinced the provincial assembly in September 1702 to fund an expedition against St. Augustine.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Siege_of_St._Augustine_(1702)" title="wikilink">The expedition</a> was a failure, and there was rioting in Charles Town over the expenses incurred.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> One significant accomplishment of the St. Augustine expedition was the destruction of coastal Spanish mission towns in <a href="Guale_Province" title="wikilink">Guale Province</a> (present-day coastal Georgia).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> After the expedition, the remaining Spanish missions were concentrated in Apalachee and <a href="Timucua_Province" title="wikilink">Timucua Province</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Missions in <a href="Mocama_Province" title="wikilink">Mocama Province</a> were consolidated south of the <a href="St._Johns_River" title="wikilink">St. Johns River</a>, and those in Timucua were consolidated at <a href="San_Francisco_de_Potano" title="wikilink">San Francisco de Potano</a>. In early 1703 Creeks attacked <a href="San_Joseph_de_Ocuya" title="wikilink">San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Ocuya</a> and San Francisco de Potano, and either Patali or Piritiba; it is possible that as many as 500 Indians were enslaved as a result of these raids.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ayubale">Ayubale</h2>
<p>In 1703 ex-Governor Moore presented to the Carolina assembly and his replacement, <a href="Nathaniel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Johnson</a>, a plan for an expedition against the Spanish towns in Apalachee Province.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He promised that, unlike the St. Augustine expedition, the colony would not have to pay for anything; he expected its costs to be recovered by the taking of loot and slaves.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On September 7, 1703, the Carolina assembly approved the plan, asking Moore to go &quot;to the Assistance of the Cowetaws and other our friendly Indians, and to attacque the Appalaches.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After recruiting 50 colonists, he traveled to the upper waters of the <a href="Ocmulgee_River" title="wikilink">Ocmulgee River</a>, where he recruited 1,000 <a href="Creek_people" title="wikilink">Creek</a> Indians to join the expedition against their traditional enemies.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Church_San_Luis.jpg" title="fig:Reconstructed church at San Luis de Apalachee; Ayubale&#39;s church may have resembled it" alt="Reconstructed church at San Luis de Apalachee; Ayubale&#39;s church may have resembled it" /> On January 25, 1704 Moore's force arrived at Ayubale, one of the larger mission towns in Apalachee. While most of the Creeks raided the surrounding villages, Moore took most of the whites and 15 Creek into Ayubale itself around 7:00 am. The only resistance was organized by Father Angel Miranda, who retreated into the town's church compound, which was surrounded by a mud wall. With 26 men he successfully held the English at bay for nine hours, and only surrendered himself, his men, and 58 women and children after they ran out of arrows.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to one Spanish account, Miranda threw himself and his followers on Moore's mercy. He was, according to this account (but apparently not others; see below) then summarily slain in cold blood by Moore's Indian allies, and some of his followers were then tortured and killed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Word of the attack reached <a href="San_Luis_de_Apalachee" title="wikilink">San Luis de Apalachee</a>, eight <a href="league_(unit)" title="wikilink">leagues</a> (about ) south of Ayubale, where Captain Juan Ru&lt;U+00ED&gt;z de Mex&lt;U+00ED&gt;a raised a force of 400 Apalachee and 30 Spanish cavalry.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> This force engaged Moore's at Ayubale, and was decisively defeated. More than 200 Apalachees were killed or captured, three Spaniards were killed and eight were captured, with Mex&lt;U+00ED&gt;a among the captured. There is evidence that as many as 50 Apalachee joined with the English against the Spanish-led forces in this encounter.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Moore considered making an attack on the fort at San Luis, but his force had suffered a significant number of wounds, so he opted instead for an attempt at extortion. He released Miranda, Mex&lt;U+00ED&gt;a and 4 other Spaniards to go to San Luis with the expectation that he would receive a ransom in exchange. However, the garrison commander refused to pay.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="further-raiding-in-apalachee">Further raiding in Apalachee</h2>
<p>Following the battle at Ayubale, Moore continued his march through Apalachee. One village, San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco, survived when its leader surrendered his church's gold ornaments and a train of supplies.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Moore moved slowly, since many of the Apalachee apparently wanted to leave with the English. According to his report, most of the population of seven villages joined his march voluntarily.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>They looted the province, capturing, according to Moore, about 1,400 Apalachees. According to Moore's account of the expedition, more than 1,100 men, women, and children were killed. More than 4,300, mostly women and children, were &quot;enslaved&quot;, and some 300 were &quot;removed into exile&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The only major missions to survive in Apalachee were San Luis and San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco, and these were soon abandoned and consolidated at Abosaya, east of San Francisco de Potano.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Historian Mark Boyd has analyzed English and Spanish sources documenting the missions and the effects of Moore's raid. According to his analysis,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> the following missions were the ones most likely to have been destroyed by Moore (whose accounts do not describe the places taken by name):</p>
<ul>
<li>La Concepcion de Ayubale</li>
<li>San Francisco de Oconi</li>
<li>San Antonio de Bacqua</li>
<li>San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Tomole</li>
<li>Santa Cruz y San Pedro de Alc&lt;U+00E1&gt;ntara de Ychuntafun</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="later-raids">Later raids</h2>
<p>In the wake of Moore's raids, further raids were made into northern Florida. In August 1704 Creeks destroyed the <a href="Yustaga_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Yustagan</a> missions of San Pedro and San Mateo; a year later they attacked the Apalachee at Abosaya. Further attacks against Abosaya the next month prompted the survivors to flee to St. Augustine. In the spring of 1706 Creek raiders besieged San Francisco de Potano and attacked the La Chua ranch near Abosaya; both of these were abandoned, and Timucua was virtually depopulated by May 1706.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> According to Apalachee scholar John Hamm, between Moore's raids and these later ones, 2,000 Indians went into exile, and an unknown number were enslaved.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The French governor of Mobile, <a href="Jean-Baptiste_Le_Moyne,_Sieur_de_Bienville" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville</a>, wrote that raiding the Florida area resulted in the killing of 2,000 Apalachees and the capture 32 Spaniards, 17 of whom were burned alive.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> By the end of 1706 the Spanish presence in Florida had been reduced to St. Augustine and Pensacola.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>Many survivors fled westward and settled near the French colonial outpost of <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile</a>, while others ended up near either St. Augustine or Pensacola;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Bienville reported that about 600 refugees were settled near Mobile.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The Apalachees taken by Moore were resettled either along the <a href="Savannah_River" title="wikilink">Savannah River</a>, or among the Creek on the Ocmulgee River.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The free Apalachees that settled these areas were frequently harassed by slavers, resulting in some cases where protests were made to Carolina authorities over their status.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The Spanish responded to the raids by encouraging privateering raids against Carolina coastal plantations. In the following years, the English colonists continued to make inroads against Spanish and French interests in Florida and on the Gulf Coast, but they were never able to capture St. Augustine, Pensacola, or Mobile, the main Spanish and French settlements. Pensacola <a href="Siege_of_Pensacola_(1707)" title="wikilink">was twice besieged</a> in 1707, apparently with English colonial support.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> English-supplied Indians also made incursions into French-dominated territories to the west, even <a href="Battle_of_Mobile_(1709)" title="wikilink">raiding an Indian village near Mobile</a> in 1709.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="historiography">Historiography</h2>
<p>Due in part to the somewhat fragmentary and contradictory primary materials about these raids, historians have written at times widely varying accounts of the number of Indians that were enslaved. Vernon Crane, in <em>The Southern Frontier, 1670&lt;U+2013&gt;1732</em> (originally published in 1929), uncritically accepts Moore's numbers,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and 19th century South Carolina historian Edward McCrady only mentions 1,400 Apalachees being taken, of whom only 100 were slaves.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Historian Allan Gallay, in a modern analysis, opines that the raids in 1704 alone resulted in the enslavement of between 2,000 and 4,000 Indians.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Opinions also differ as to the fate of the 1,300 Moore voluntarily resettled. Since a 1715 census of the Savannah River settlements counted fewer than 650 Apalachees, historian Allan Gallay believes that the balance were probably sold into slavery,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> while James Covington believes that a combination of factors was to blame: in addition to active slaving against those settlements, disease, intermarriage with other tribes, and migration to other communities account for the difference.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
