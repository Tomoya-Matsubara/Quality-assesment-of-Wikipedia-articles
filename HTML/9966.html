<p>The <strong>Orange County Transportation Authority</strong> (<strong>OCTA</strong>) is the <a href="public_sector" title="wikilink">public sector</a> <a href="transport" title="wikilink">transportation</a> <a href="planning" class="uri" title="wikilink">planning</a> body and <a href="mass_transit" title="wikilink">mass transit</a> service provider for <a href="Orange_County,_California" title="wikilink">Orange County, California</a>. Its ancestor agencies include not only the prior <a href="Orange_County_Transit_District" title="wikilink">Orange County Transit District</a> but also such diverse entities as the <a href="Pacific_Electric_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pacific Electric Railroad</a> and the South Coast Transit Corporation. In 2005, OCTA was judged <em>America's Best Public Transportation System</em> by the <a href="American_Public_Transportation_Association" title="wikilink">American Public Transportation Association</a>, for its record ridership gains in the bus and the <a href="Metrolink_(Southern_California)" title="wikilink">Metrolink</a> commuter trains that it operates or funds. OCTA also operates the <a href="91_Express_Lanes" title="wikilink">91 Express Lanes</a>.</p>
<p>The Authority's administrative offices are located in <a href="Orange,_California" title="wikilink">Orange</a> and it maintains bus operations bases in <a href="Anaheim,_California" title="wikilink">Anaheim</a>, <a href="Garden_Grove,_California" title="wikilink">Garden Grove</a>, and <a href="Santa_Ana,_California" title="wikilink">Santa Ana</a>. A <a href="paratransit" class="uri" title="wikilink">paratransit</a> base operated by <a href="Veolia_Transportation" title="wikilink">Veolia Transportation</a> for the authority's ACCESS service is located on Construction Circle in <a href="Irvine,_California" title="wikilink">Irvine</a>, While a number of fixed routes are operated by <a href="MV_Transportation" title="wikilink">MV Transportation</a>, out of the Sand Canyon Yard, also in Irvine.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1991, OCTA was created under state law combining the Orange County agencies that managed transportation planning (Orange County Transportation Commission), <a href="Park-and-ride" class="uri" title="wikilink">Park-and-ride</a> facilities, public transportation (what was then the Orange County Transit District), and other transportation related administrative offices into one organization. OCTA administers funds from <em>Measure M</em>, the half cent transportation <a href="sales_tax" title="wikilink">sales tax</a>. Measure M was originally passed in 1990, and was renewed in 2006. It has has paid for expansion on most freeway miles in Orange County, street improvements and repairs, traffic signal synchronization, and increased Metrolink service.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>OCTA suffered tremendously during the 1995 Orange County <a href="bankruptcy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bankruptcy</a>. The agency lost $202 million in revenue over 17 years due to the bankruptcy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As a result, bus service was reduced.</p>
<p>In 2000, OCTA embarked on a bus restructuring effort dubbed <strong>Straightlining</strong>, later renamed <strong>Point to Point</strong>. The goal of Straightlining was to better utilize funding for the bus system by eliminating long deviations and keeping buses on major streets instead of through neighborhoods. Routes were straightened out and almost every route in the system was changed in September 2000. However, the project failed spectacularly, as ridership dropped due to the increased number of transfers required, while paradoxically overcrowding on some routes increased because OCTA failed to plan for higher ridership along its core routes. In addition, the implementation of Straightlining was problematic as over 100 schedule changes were required in the three months immediately following implementation. Politically, problems occurred such as removing service to the local <a href="Braille_Institute" title="wikilink">Braille Institute</a>, which was rescinded before implementation. In the end, many routes were re-combined and deviations reinstated.</p>
<h2 id="labor-disputes">Labor disputes</h2>
<p>OCTA (including the former OCTD) has been involved in various labor disputes between itself and its drivers, members of the <a href="Teamsters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teamsters</a> Union Local 952, including strikes in 1986 and 2007.</p>

<p>In April 2007, drivers threatened to strike again over the current contract. The OCTA offered a 13% raise over three years, but union sources said that it only came out to 8% after factoring in <a href="inflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflation</a>. The drivers voted to strike. California governor <a href="Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="wikilink">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> intervened. He first issued a one-week cool-off, and later extended it to a 60-day period, while talks continued. Negotiations over wage and pension issues failed, and the union started to strike on July 7, 2007, at the end of the cooling-off period.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This conflict was resolved on 16 July 2007 when the union ratified a new contract.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Within a few days, the bus system was running at full capability.</p>
<h2 id="formative-agencies">Formative agencies</h2>
<h4 id="orange-county-transit-district-octd">Orange County Transit District (OCTD)</h4>
<p>Orange County Transit District was created in August 1972 by a vote of the people of Orange County, originally starting with five buses operating routing for what was until then known as Santa Ana Transit, and later that year bringing in other surrounding city transit agencies. The routing system was formed over the course of about fifteen years, and was held in place until the merge.</p>
<h3 id="routes">Routes</h3>
<p>OCTA operates approximately 80 lines which encompass every city in Orange County, along with the <a href="Los_Angeles_County,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> communities of <a href="Lakewood,_California" title="wikilink">Lakewood</a>, <a href="La_Mirada,_California" title="wikilink">La Mirada</a>, <a href="Cerritos,_California" title="wikilink">Cerritos</a>, <a href="Hawaiian_Gardens,_California" title="wikilink">Hawaiian Gardens</a>, and <a href="Long_Beach,_California" title="wikilink">Long Beach</a>, along with express service to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Diamond_Bar,_California" title="wikilink">Diamond Bar</a>, the <a href="San_Bernardino_County,_California" title="wikilink">San Bernardino County</a> cities of <a href="Chino_Hills,_California" title="wikilink">Chino Hills</a> and <a href="Chino,_California" title="wikilink">Chino</a> and the <a href="Riverside_County,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside County</a> cities of <a href="Riverside,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside</a> and <a href="Corona,_California" title="wikilink">Corona</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The double digit routes (and route 1) are the fixed routes that cover almost every city in Orange County. Buses operate on most major arterial streets.</li>
<li>1xx routes are descended from the old <em>RunAbout</em> service that used to serve residential neighborhoods. Most of these routes use smaller buses. Some routes are pieces of pre-2000 longer routes shortened during Straightlining, and use full size buses.</li>
<li>2xx routes are intra-county freeway routes which utilize OC freeways. These routes run from park-and-rides and transit terminals to the business districts and back.</li>
<li>4xx routes are the <a href="Metrolink_(Southern_California)" title="wikilink">Metrolink</a> shuttles which go from the Metrolink stations to business districts and vice versa. Metrolink fareholders ride free on these buses (as they do all OCTA buses), but otherwise regular fare is charged.</li>
<li>6xx routes are very similar to 4xx routes. Most of the lines only run on weekends. Currently, there is only one in service, the 686.</li>
<li>7xx routes are express routes. Lines 701 and 721 go from <a href="Huntington_Beach,_California" title="wikilink">Huntington Beach</a> and <a href="Fullerton,_California" title="wikilink">Fullerton</a> respectively to <a href="Downtown_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Downtown Los Angeles</a> using the <a href="Harbor_Freeway_Transitway" title="wikilink">Harbor Freeway Transitway</a>, while Lines 757 connects <a href="Santa_Ana,_California" title="wikilink">Santa Ana</a> with the city of <a href="Pomona,_California" title="wikilink">Pomona</a>, Line 758 connects the city of <a href="Irvine,_California" title="wikilink">Irvine</a> to <a href="Chino,_California" title="wikilink">Chino</a>, and Line 794 connects <a href="Costa_Mesa,_California" title="wikilink">Costa Mesa</a> to <a href="Riverside,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside</a>. Line 701, 721 and 794 charge a premium fare, while the 757 and 758 do not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some routes operate short turn trips which either start or end in the middle of the route. Those trips say <em>Short Trip</em> on the <a href="headsign" class="uri" title="wikilink">headsign</a>, followed by the final destination.</p>
<p>Most buses are equipped with bike racks and can carry a maximum of two bicycles at any given time, while some smaller buses operating on shorter routes do not have bike racks.</p>
<p><a href="South_Coast_Plaza" title="wikilink">South Coast Plaza</a> is the most served attraction on the OCTA routes, served by 12 routes (51, 55, 57, 76, 86, 145, 172, 173, 211, 216, 464, 794). The longest is route 1, (<a href="Long_Beach,_California" title="wikilink">Long Beach</a>-<a href="San_Clemente,_California" title="wikilink">San Clemente</a>) which utilizes <a href="California_State_Route_1" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast Highway</a> for the vast majority of its route of over 40 miles. Trips take an average of 2-2.5 hours. Several routes, including 2xx, 4xx, and 7xx series, do not operate on weekends or holidays. Routes 43, 50, 57, and 60 are part of the &quot;Night Owl&quot; service and run 24 hours a day.</p>

<h3 id="centerline-light-rail">CenterLine light rail</h3>
<p>The <strong>CenterLine</strong>, a 9.3-mile <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> system serving <a href="Irvine,_California" title="wikilink">Irvine</a>, <a href="Costa_Mesa,_California" title="wikilink">Costa Mesa</a> and <a href="Santa_Ana,_California" title="wikilink">Santa Ana</a>, was originally planned in the 1990s, and was intended to open in 2009. Costing $1 billion USD, the route would have served destinations including <a href="John_Wayne_Airport" title="wikilink">John Wayne Airport</a>, <a href="South_Coast_Metro" title="wikilink">South Coast Metro</a>, <a href="South_Coast_Plaza" title="wikilink">South Coast Plaza</a>, <a href="Santa_Ana_College" title="wikilink">Santa Ana College</a>, and downtown Santa Ana. While OCTA had secured funding through Measure M, lack of support from most of Orange County's congressional representatives resulted in no funds from the Federal government. In February 2005, the CenterLine was suspended indefinitely, and later in May 2005, the plan was officially canceled in favor of researching express bus service throughout Orange County and improvements to <a href="Metrolink_(Southern_California)" title="wikilink">Metrolink</a>.</p>
<p>When the line was initially being planned, it was envisioned as a 30-mile route that would run from <a href="Fullerton,_California" title="wikilink">Fullerton</a> to <a href="Irvine,_California" title="wikilink">Irvine</a>, through Anaheim, <a href="Orange,_California" title="wikilink">Orange</a>, Santa Ana, and Costa Mesa. However, a lack of public support led to numerous truncations; Orange was initially removed from the route, followed by Anaheim.</p>
<h2 id="highway-and-road-operations">Highway and road operations</h2>
<p>OCTA is responsible for the Countywide Master Highway Plan, which designates major arterial streets in the County, However, all road maintenance responsibilities are with the city where the street operates in, or the County in the case of unincorporated areas. OCTA street funding is steered towards roadways on the Master Plan in recognition of their role in regional travel.</p>
<h3 id="current-projects">Current projects</h3>
<p>In 2003, a budget crisis at the state level caused funds otherwise allocated for the expansion of the <a href="California_State_Route_22" title="wikilink">Garden Grove Freeway</a> to be diverted to the resolution to the deficit; accordingly, OCTA took <a href="Measure_M" title="wikilink">Measure M</a> funds and self-funded the expansion. In summer of 2004, the contractor Granite Meyers-Rados (a <a href="joint_venture" title="wikilink">joint venture</a> between C. C. Meyers and Rados) was selected, and construction was started by December of that year. The expansion was completed in November 2006.</p>
<p>OCTA has completed carpool lanes and added some regular lanes on all other freeways. The last freeway widening to break ground is a short segment of the <a href="Santa_Ana_Freeway" title="wikilink">Santa Ana Freeway</a> from the <a href="Riverside_Freeway" title="wikilink">Riverside Freeway</a> to the <a href="Los_Angeles_County" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> line. There, the roadway will be expanded from three lanes in each direction to five (one carpool and four regular lanes). At the county line, the roadway will revert to three lanes in each direction, because the <a href="Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> has not allocated funding for the expansion in Los Angeles County.</p>
<h3 id="express-lanes">91 Express Lanes</h3>
<p>OCTA administers the <a href="91_Express_Lanes" title="wikilink">91 Express Lanes</a> after purchasing them from the California Private Transportation Corporation. The roadway was purchased to extinguish a &quot;non-compete&quot; clause that prevented safety and traffic flow improvements along the ten mile stretch of tollway. The other tollways in Orange County are governed by the <a href="Transportation_Corridor_Agencies" title="wikilink">Transportation Corridor Agencies</a>.</p>
