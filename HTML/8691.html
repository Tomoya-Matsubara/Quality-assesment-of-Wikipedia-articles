<p><strong>William Thad Cochran</strong> (born December 7, 1937 in <a href="Pontotoc,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Pontotoc, Mississippi</a>) is the senior <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senator</a> from <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, and is a member of the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>He was born in <a href="Pontotoc,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Pontotoc, Mississippi</a>, to William Holmes Cochran and Emma Grace (<a href="Married_and_maiden_names" title="wikilink">nee</a> Berry), a <a href="school_principal" title="wikilink">school principal</a> and a <a href="teacher" class="uri" title="wikilink">teacher</a>, respectively. His family settled in <a href="Hinds_County,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Hinds County, Mississippi</a>, home of the state capital, <a href="Jackson,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Jackson</a>, in <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a> after a few moves around the northern part of the state. Cochran still lives in Jackson today.Cochran earned <a href="Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="wikilink">Eagle Scout</a> as a youth and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Eagle_Scout_Award" title="wikilink">Distinguished Eagle Scout Award</a> as an adult. He graduated from Byram High School near Jackson and received a B.A. degree from the <a href="University_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">University of Mississippi</a> with a major in <a href="psychology" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychology</a> and a minor in <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a> in 1959. There he joined the <a href="Pi_Kappa_Alpha" title="wikilink">Pi Kappa Alpha</a> Fraternity and was on the <a href="cheerleading" class="uri" title="wikilink">cheerleading</a> squad with fellow senator <a href="Trent_Lott" title="wikilink">Trent Lott</a>. After a time in the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1961), he attended the <a href="University_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">University of Mississippi</a> School of Law, was elected to the <a href="Phi_Kappa_Phi" title="wikilink">Phi Kappa Phi</a> honor society and graduated in 1965. He then practiced law for seven years. He married Rose Clayton on June 6, 1964; the couple has two children.</p>
<p>Cochran grew up as a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>, but became a Republican sometime in the mid-to-late 1960s. He served as head of <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>'s Mississippi campaign in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1968" title="wikilink">1968</a>.</p>
<h2 id="united-states-congress">United States Congress</h2>
<p>In 1972, <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congressman</a> <a href="Charles_H._Griffin" title="wikilink">Charles H. Griffin</a> of  decided not to run for a third full term. Cochran won the Republican nomination for the Jackson-based district, which was renumbered as  after redistricting.He defeated Democratic state senator Ellis Bodron by just under four points. A factor in Cochran's victory was the strong Republican showing in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1972" title="wikilink">that year's presidential election</a>, in which Nixon won 49 of 50 states, and 78Â percent of Mississippi's popular vote. That year, Cochran and <a href="Trent_Lott" title="wikilink">Trent Lott</a> (who later served alongside him in the U.S. Senate) became the second and third Republicans to represent Mississippi in the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a> since <a href="Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a>. Cochran quickly became very popular in this district, even though almost none of its living residents had been represented by a Republican before. He was handily reelected in 1974, a year in which anger over the <a href="Watergate_scandal" title="wikilink">Watergate scandal</a> caused several Republicans to lose their seats. He was reelected by an even larger margin in 1976.</p>
<p>In 1978, Cochran, running for the U.S. Senate in the wake of <a href="James_Eastland" title="wikilink">James Eastland</a>'s decision not not to run for re-election, then defeated Democrat Maurice Dantin and <a href="independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">independent</a> candidate <a href="Charles_Evers" title="wikilink">Charles Evers</a>. This made him the first Republican to win a statewide election in Mississippi since Reconstruction. Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader <a href="Medgar_Evers" title="wikilink">Medgar Evers</a>, may have siphoned off many black votes that would have otherwise gone to Dantin.</p>
<p>When Eastland resigned two days after Christmas, Cochran was appointed to the seat by governor <a href="Cliff_Finch" title="wikilink">Cliff Finch</a> and started his Senate career a week early. He handily defeated <a href="governor_of_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="William_Winter_(politician)" title="wikilink">William Winter</a> in 1984, was unopposed in 1990, reelected with over 70 percent of the vote in 1996 and faced no major-party opposition in 2002. He won reelection in 2008 by a wide margin over <a href="Erik_Fleming" title="wikilink">Erik Fleming</a>; assuming Cochran completes his current term, he will pass Eastland as the second-longest serving Senator in Mississippi's history. Until 1989, Cochran served alongside longtime Democrat <a href="John_Stennis" title="wikilink">John Stennis</a>, the longest-serving Senator in Mississippi's history. He is currently the eighth-longest serving Senator, and the third longest-serving Republican.</p>
<p>Cochran's voting record is considered fairly moderate by Southern conservative standards. He has a lifetime rating of 80 from the <a href="American_Conservative_Union" title="wikilink">American Conservative Union</a>. In 2008, he garnered a rating of 68 from the ACU; the only Republican Senators from a Southern state to score lower were <a href="Mel_Martinez" title="wikilink">Mel Martinez</a> of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> and <a href="John_Warner" title="wikilink">John Warner</a> of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>. He has maintained a lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest for a six-term Senator. This stands in marked contrast to Eastland, Stennis and Lott.</p>
<p>However, Cochran has considerable influence behind the scenes, especially in Mississippi. This is not surprising given his status as the &quot;elder statesman&quot; of the state Republican Party. In April 2006, Cochran was selected by <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> as one of &quot;America's 10 Best Senators&quot;; the magazine quoted an unnamed &quot;senior GOP Senator&quot; who said &quot;He doesn't get a whole lot of play in terms of coverage, but he is effectively stubborn doing what needs to be done.&quot; For example, in December 2005 he bluntly said a defense spending bill wouldn't pass unless it included funding for the Gulf Coast, which had been ravaged by <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Cochran served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference (caucus) from 1991 to 1996, and is its only former chair currently in the Senate; he chaired the <a href="U.S._Senate_Committee_on_Agriculture,_Nutrition_and_Forestry" title="wikilink">Senate Agriculture Committee</a> from 2003 to 2005. In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of the powerful <a href="U.S._Senate_Committee_on_Appropriations" title="wikilink">Senate Appropriations Committee</a>, making him the first Republican from a former <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate state</a> to chair the committee. He is currently that committee's <a href="ranking_member" title="wikilink">ranking</a> Republican.</p>
<p>It appears that recognition from his colleagues was quick in coming: In 2005, an agricultural appropriations bill proposed by the Committee Cochran chaired contained a provision (sec. 782) that said: </p>
<p>In April 2006, he was selected by <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> as one of &quot;America's 10 Best Senators.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 18, 2006, Cochran voted, along with 19 Republican Senators, for the <a href="Stem_Cell_Research_Enhancement_Act" title="wikilink">Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act</a> to lift restrictions on federal funding for the research.</p>
<p>In 2005 he was one of nine senators who voted against the <a href="Detainee_Treatment_Act_of_2005" title="wikilink">Detainee Treatment Act of 2005</a>, which prohibited &quot;inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at <a href="Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp" title="wikilink">Guantanamo Bay</a>&quot;. The others, all Republicans, were <a href="Wayne_Allard" title="wikilink">Wayne Allard</a>, <a href="Kit_Bond" title="wikilink">Kit Bond</a>, <a href="Tom_Coburn" title="wikilink">Tom Coburn</a>, <a href="Jeff_Sessions" title="wikilink">Jeff Sessions</a>, <a href="Jim_Inhofe" title="wikilink">Jim Inhofe</a>, <a href="Pat_Roberts" title="wikilink">Pat Roberts</a>, <a href="John_Cornyn" title="wikilink">John Cornyn</a> and <a href="Ted_Stevens" title="wikilink">Ted Stevens</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2009 his former aide, <a href="Ann_Copland" title="wikilink">Ann Copland</a>, pleaded guilty to swapping legislative favors for event tickets and other gifts from lobbyist <a href="Jack_Abramoff" title="wikilink">Jack Abramoff</a>. Copland worked for Cochran for 29 years.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Cochran has not been indicted for any charges in connection to <a href="Jack_Abramoff" title="wikilink">Jack Abramoff</a>.</p>
<h2 id="re-election-campaign">2008 re-election campaign</h2>

<p>Cochran sought another term in the Senate, and as of 2007 was not expected to face serious opposition.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Then, later in the campaign <a href="Erik_R._Fleming" title="wikilink">Erik R. Fleming</a> (a former Mississippi state senator) won the Democratic nomination and went on against Cochran. On November 5, 2008, Cochran won by a landslide with over 61% of the vote against Fleming (D) with only 38% of the vote.</p>
<p>Cochran originally endorsed <a href="Fred_Thompson" title="wikilink">Fred Thompson</a> for President; however, in light of Thompson's withdrawal, he endorsed former <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> Governor <a href="Mitt_Romney" title="wikilink">Mitt Romney</a> for president. When Romney dropped out of the race, Cochran endorsed Senator <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a>, who lost the general election campaign to Democratic presidential nominee <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>.</p>
