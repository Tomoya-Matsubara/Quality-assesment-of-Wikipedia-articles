<p><strong><em>Fear Factor</em></strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> stunt/dare <a href="reality_television" title="wikilink">reality</a> <a href="game_show" title="wikilink">game show</a>.</p>
<p>The original Dutch version was called <em>Now or Neverland</em>. When <a href="Endemol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Endemol</a> USA and <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> adapted it to the American market in 2001, they changed the name to <em>Fear Factor</em>.</p>
<p>The show pits <a href="contestant" title="wikilink">contestants</a> against each other to complete a series of <a href="stunt" title="wikilink">stunts</a> better and/or quicker than all the other contestants, by doing this in the fastest time, for a grand prize of <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>50,000. From Seasons One to Five, the contestants were generally three men and three women, all playing for themselves, but in Season Six, the show moved to a permanent format of four teams of two people, each with a pre-existing relationship with one another, all playing for a shared prize of the same amount. The show is hosted by UFC commentator and comedian <a href="Joe_Rogan" title="wikilink">Joe Rogan</a>, executive produced by <a href="Matt_Kunitz" title="wikilink">Matt Kunitz</a> and directed by <a href="J._Rupert_Thompson" title="wikilink">J. Rupert Thompson</a>.</p>
<p>As NBC's answer to the successful series <em><a href="Survivor_(US_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Survivor</a></em>, the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001, and built strong ratings for the next couple of seasons, but as the years passed, the ratings declined. In 2006, <em>Fear Factor</em> faced tough competition with TV ratings champion, the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> talent series <em><a href="American_Idol" title="wikilink">American Idol</a></em> on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom <em><a href="Joey_(sitcom)" title="wikilink">Joey</a></em>, which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. NBC then canceled <em>Fear Factor</em> in May. The network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be burned throughout the summer.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 2004, <em>Fear Factor</em> became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, <em>Fear Factor</em> earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010.</p>

<h3 id="normal-format">Normal format</h3>
<p>Before the contestants were introduced, Rogan said the following: &quot;I'm Joe Rogan. This is <em>Fear Factor</em>. The stunts you are about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.&quot;</p>
<p>The normal format involved three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who had to complete three professional stunts to win <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>50,000. If a contestant/team was too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or (in some cases) had the worst performance on a stunt, they were eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completed the first or the second stunt, they automatically won $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt returned for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000. (In season one, if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.)</p>
<p>Only once in the history of <em>Fear Factor</em> did the $50,000 top prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won.</p>
<p>After the acquisition of <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal Studios</a> of <a href="Vivendi_Universal" title="wikilink">Vivendi Universal</a> by <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>'s parent company <a href="General_Electric" title="wikilink">General Electric</a> in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of <a href="NBC_Universal" title="wikilink">NBC Universal</a> at <a href="Universal_Orlando" title="wikilink">Universal Orlando</a>, or win trips to Universal Studios in <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>The order of the stunts on a typical episode of <em>Fear Factor</em> is as follows:</p>
<h4 id="first-stunt">First stunt</h4>
<p>The first stunt was designed to physically test each of the contestants (e.g., jumping from one building to the next). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, furthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) would move on to the second stunt. The others were eliminated.</p>
<h4 id="second-stunt">Second stunt</h4>
<p>The second stunt was meant to mentally challenge the contestants. The three most common types of stunts in the second round were eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entailed ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple gross items; animal stunts entailed immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entailed retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (e.g., blood, lard) or live animals (such as sit in a tub of snakes as long as they could). Less often, the second stunt would involve a pain endurance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a <a href="tear_gas" title="wikilink">tear gas</a> chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, or ingesting <a href="habanero_peppers" title="wikilink">habanero peppers</a>. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants were typically not eliminated after this stunt unless they did not complete it, or vomited before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for performing the worst.</p>
<p>In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value.</p>
<h4 id="third-stunt">Third stunt</h4>
<p>The third and final stunt was usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an <a href="action_film" title="wikilink">action film</a>. Like the first stunt, it usually involved heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt was always competitive. The player with the best performance this round would win the grand prize, usually <a href="U.S._Dollars" title="wikilink">$</a>50,000, and had the privilege of being informed &quot;evidently fear is not a factor for you&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="other-formats">Other formats</h2>
<h4 id="tournament-of-champions">Tournament of Champions</h4>
<p>The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize.</p>
<p>In Season 2, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first two stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, dividing the group from eight and five to four to two. The final four contestants, two men and two women, competed against each other for the grand prize.</p>
<p>In Season 3, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 <a href="Mazda_RX-8" title="wikilink">Mazda RX-8</a> and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.</p>
<h4 id="special-episode-formats">Special episode formats</h4>
<p><strong>Naked Fear Factor</strong> (Season 2): The first &quot;stunt&quot; wasn't really a stunt at all. Six contestants, three male and three female, were required to strip naked and parade down a fashion style runway in front of over a hundred people for three minutes while photographers took pictures. All six successfully completed this stunt and moved on to the next round.</p>
<p><strong>Four Stunt Show</strong> (Seasons 3-6): This was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode was notable for the stunt involving <a href="body_piercing" title="wikilink">body piercing</a>. In seasons 4-6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt, in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with other special formats, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Reality Stars Fear Factor.</p>
<p><strong>All-Gross Show</strong> (Seasons 3-6): All three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved <a href="Apple_bobbing" title="wikilink">bobbing</a> for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow <a href="blood" class="uri" title="wikilink">blood</a>. In seasons 4-5, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season 6, a &quot;Farm Fear Factor&quot; episode featured all gross stunts.</p>
<p><strong>Las Vegas Show</strong> (Seasons 3-5): Stunts took place at various <a href="hotel" title="wikilink">hotels</a> and <a href="casino" title="wikilink">casinos</a> in <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>. The show's winner was required to bet at least half their winnings on one hand of <a href="Blackjack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blackjack</a>, with the chance to continue gambling if successful.</p>
<p><strong>Second Chance</strong> (Season 4): Losing contestants from previous seasons came back for a second chance at winning $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Winners</strong> (Season 5): Winning contestants from previous seasons came back for a chance at winning another $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>Couples</strong> (Seasons 3-5): Four couples competed in three stunts, with the winning team dividing the prize (and, in season 3, sending one player to the Tournament of Champions).</p>
<p>In Season 4, nine couples competed over seven weeks and 17 stunts for $1,000,000. Along the way, they competed for various other prizes, including $10,000, <a href="Automobile" title="wikilink">cars</a>, vacations, <a href="credit_card" title="wikilink">credit cards</a>, and a chance to steal a desired prize from another team. In Season 5, eight couples competed for the million dollar prize.</p>
<p>While not specifically designated as &quot;couples&quot; episodes, several themed episodes in Season 6 featured all-couples teams. These episodes included &quot;Psycho Fear Factor&quot; and &quot;Old vs. Young&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Twins</strong> (Seasons 2, 4, 5): In season 2, three pairs of <a href="twins" class="uri" title="wikilink">twins</a> competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In seasons 4 and 5, four pairs of twins competed as teams in all stunts, with the winning team dividing the prize.</p>
<p><strong>Best Friends</strong> (Season 5): Four pairs of best friends competed in three stunts, with the winning team dividing the prize.</p>
<p><strong>Family</strong> (Seasons 4 and 6): Four teams of one parent and one child competed in three stunts for the prize. In the second stunt, the team with the best performance received a bonus prize such as a car or a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>$1 Million</strong> (Season 4): Twelve contestants competed in six stunts. The one player who survived all six won a $1,000,000 annuity.</p>
<p><strong>Models</strong> (Seasons 4 and 5): Played in the normal format with models or entirely female contestants. The fifth season had one episode with male and female models.</p>
<p><strong>Fear Factor <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a> Halftime Show</strong> (Season 2): Played in the normal format with <em><a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a></em> Playmates.</p>
<p><strong>Miss USA</strong> (Seasons 3-5): Played in the normal format with <a href="Miss_USA" title="wikilink">Miss USA</a> contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of <em>Fear Factor</em>, as <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> produced a Miss USA edition of <em><a href="Deal_or_No_Deal_(US_game_show)" title="wikilink">Deal or No Deal</a></em> instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode.</p>

<p><strong>No Sleep</strong> (Season 4) Five co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants were not allowed to sleep for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the history of the show in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.</p>
<p><strong>Home Invasion</strong>: This was included at the end of each episode in Season 6. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging the family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit, ingesting something foul or undesirable before receiving keys to open two safes, both containing $5,000 credit cards from <a href="Capital_One" title="wikilink">Capital One</a>.</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p><em>Fear Factor</em> has received criticism from the general public mainly because of the show's second stunt, which intends to <a href="disgust" class="uri" title="wikilink">disgust</a> its viewers. More seriously, the <a href="American_Humane_Association" title="wikilink">American Humane Association</a> expressed concerns for allowing animals and insects to get injured and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional <a href="animal_training" title="wikilink">animal trainers</a> have refused to work on the show because the producers of <em>Fear Factor</em> have demanded stunts which violate the association's guidelines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American Humane believes that shows like <em>Fear Factor</em> are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare &lt;U+2014&gt; or even that of their human contestants &lt;U+2014&gt; are producing unacceptable programming. — <a href="Karen_Rosa" title="wikilink">Karen Rosa</a> (Communications Manager of AHA Film and TV Unit) <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In January 2005, an episode featuring a stunt involving blended <a href="rats" class="uri" title="wikilink">rats</a> aired in its normal <a href="prime_time" title="wikilink">prime time</a> slot. Austin Aitken, a part-time <a href="paralegal" class="uri" title="wikilink">paralegal</a> from <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, sued <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> for $2.5 million <a href="USD" class="uri" title="wikilink">USD</a> for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his <a href="blood_pressure" title="wikilink">blood pressure</a> rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment protection</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Fear Factor</em> was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with &quot;electrified wires&quot; replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing. The <a href="Edison_Electric_Institute" title="wikilink">Edison Electric Institute</a> issued a warning regarding the episode, fearing that viewers might attempt to climb through a real substation with more fatal results.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="spin-off-products">Spin-off products</h2>
<p><em>Fear Factor</em> has also resulted in various spin-off products:</p>
<ul>
<li>A game called <em><a href="Fear_Factor:_Unleashed" title="wikilink">Fear Factor: Unleashed</a></em> was by <a href="Hip_Interactive" title="wikilink">Hip Interactive</a> for the <a href="Game_Boy_Advance" title="wikilink">Game Boy Advance</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
<li>A <a href="board_game" title="wikilink">board game</a> called Fear Factor Game was published by Master Pieces.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
<li>There are a few books based on <em>Fear Factor</em>, such as <em>The Fear Factor Cookbook</em> and <em>Fear Factor Mad Libs</em>.</li>
<li>Brand New Candy, LLC. makes several novelty candies that are based on <em>Fear Factor</em>, including eyeballs.</li>
<li>A <a href="Hindi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindi</a> reality show called Khatronke Khiladi (English: The players of Danger) based on Fear Factor was introduced in India. Its host was <a href="Bollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bollywood</a> superstar <a href="Akshay_Kumar" title="wikilink">Akshay Kumar</a></li>
<li>A theme park show called <em><a href="Fear_Factor_Live" title="wikilink">Fear Factor Live</a></em> opened at <a href="Universal_Studios_Florida" title="wikilink">Universal Studios Florida</a> and <a href="Universal_Studios_Hollywood" title="wikilink">Universal Studios Hollywood</a> in the Spring of 2005.
