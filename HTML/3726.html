<p><strong>Netley Abbey</strong> is a ruined <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> near <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a> in <a href="Hampshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. The abbey was founded in 1239 as a house for monks of the austere <a href="Cistercian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cistercian</a> order. Despite being a royal abbey, Netley was never rich, produced no influential scholars or churchmen, and its nearly 300-year history was quiet. The monks were best known to their neighbours for the generous hospitality they offered to travellers on land and sea.</p>
<p>In 1536, Netley was closed by <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII of England</a> during the <a href="Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries" title="wikilink">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> and the building was converted into a mansion by <a href="William_Paulet,_1st_Marquess_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">William Paulet</a>, a wealthy <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> politician. The abbey was used as a <a href="country_house" title="wikilink">country house</a> until the beginning of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials. Subsequently the ruins became a tourist attraction, and provided inspiration to poets and artists of the <a href="romanticism" title="wikilink">romantic</a> movement. In the early twentieth century the site was given to the nation, and it is now a <a href="Scheduled_Ancient_Monument" title="wikilink">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, cared for by <a href="English_Heritage" title="wikilink">English Heritage</a>. The extensive remains consist of the church, <a href="cloister" class="uri" title="wikilink">cloister</a> buildings, abbot's house, and fragments of the post-Dissolution mansion. Netley Abbey is one of the best preserved medieval Cistercian monasteries in southern England.</p>
<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<p>Netley was founded in 1239 by <a href="Peter_des_Roches" title="wikilink">Peter des Roches</a>, a powerful politician, government official, and <a href="Bishop_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Winchester</a> from 1205&lt;U+2013&gt;1238.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The abbey was one of a pair the bishop conceived as a memorial to himself; the other is <a href="La_Clart&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Dieu" title="wikilink">La Clart&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Dieu</a> in <a href="Saint-Paterne-Racan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Paterne-Racan</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Des Roches began to purchase the lands for Netley's initial endowment in about 1236, but he died before the project was finished and the foundation was completed by his <a href="executors" class="uri" title="wikilink">executors</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to the Chronicle of <a href="Waverley_Abbey" title="wikilink">Waverley Abbey</a>, the first monks arrived to settle the site on 25 July 1239 from neighbouring <a href="Beaulieu_Abbey" title="wikilink">Beaulieu Abbey</a>, a year after the bishop's death.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As its founder had died before the vital task of collecting the endowment was complete, the abbey started its life in a difficult financial situation. It is thought that little work took place on the permanent stone monastery until the house was taken under the wing of <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a>, who became interested in the abbey in the mid 1240s and eventually assumed the role of patron in 1251.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="buildings">Buildings</h2>
<h3 id="church">Church</h3>
<p>The fruits of royal patronage were demonstrated by the construction of a large church ( long), built in the fashionable French-influenced <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">gothic</a> style pioneered by Henry's masons at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>. The high quality and elaborate nature of the church's decoration, particularly its mouldings and <a href="tracery" class="uri" title="wikilink">tracery</a>, indicate a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur appropriate to a secular <a href="cathedral" class="uri" title="wikilink">cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The <a href="presbytery_(architecture)" title="wikilink">presbytery</a> and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the <a href="nave" class="uri" title="wikilink">nave</a> was filled in over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from <a href="Derbyshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a> in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed &quot;H. DI. GRA REX ANGE&quot; (<a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>: &quot;Henry by the Grace of God King of the English&quot;) shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey's patron. The church took many decades to complete, and was probably finished between 1290 and 1320.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Dating the various parts of the building is predominantly done on stylistic grounds.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Netley_abbey_.jpg" title="fig:The east window of the church" alt="The east window of the church" /> The church was vaulted and <a href="cruciform" class="uri" title="wikilink">cruciform</a> in shape, with a square <a href="presbytery_(architecture)" title="wikilink">presbytery</a> and a low central tower containing bells.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was <a href="aisle" title="wikilink">aisled</a> throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each <a href="transept" class="uri" title="wikilink">transept</a>. There was no <a href="triforium" class="uri" title="wikilink">triforium</a>, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a <a href="clerestory" class="uri" title="wikilink">clerestory</a> of triple <a href="lancet_window" title="wikilink">lancet windows</a> ran above each <a href="bay_(architecture)" title="wikilink">bay</a> of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end the presbytery, probably built after 1260, has a large window which features an upper <a href="rose_window" title="wikilink">rose</a> and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows are simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle has plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof. The north aisle windows by contrast have richly decorated cusped tracery, reflecting the changes in taste over the long period of construction, and suggesting that this was among the last parts of the church to be finished, probably in the very late thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The west wall of the church also has a large window, the tracery of which was destroyed in a collapse during the eighteenth century. Surviving fragments show that it was built in a &quot;freer and more advanced style&quot; than other parts of the church, and suggest a date around the turn of the fourteenth century.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Internally, the church was subdivided into several areas. The high altar was against the east wall of the presbytery, flanked by two smaller altars on the side walls.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> To the west, under the tower, were the monks' <a href="choir_stalls" title="wikilink">choir stalls</a> where they sat during services, and further west was a <a href="pulpitum" class="uri" title="wikilink">pulpitum</a> or <a href="rood_screen" title="wikilink">rood screen</a>, which blocked access to the ritual areas of the church.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In the nave, the <a href="lay_brothers" title="wikilink">lay brothers</a> had their own choir stalls and altar for services.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The monks of Netley kept up a schedule of services and prayer both day and night following the <a href="canonical_hours" title="wikilink">canonical hours</a>; a staircase in the south transept went up to the monks' dormitory, allowing them to conveniently attend night services.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The lay brothers had their own entrance to the church at the west end via a covered gallery from their accommodation.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike rival orders such as the <a href="Benedictines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benedictines</a>, who allowed the nave to be used by parishioners and visitors, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely for the use of the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at <a href="Hailes_Abbey" title="wikilink">Hailes Abbey</a> with its relic of the <a href="Blood_of_Christ" title="wikilink">Holy Blood</a>, and to allow the construction of tombs and <a href="chantries" class="uri" title="wikilink">chantries</a> for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cloister-and-east-range">Cloister and east range</h3>
<p>South of the church stands a <a href="cloister" class="uri" title="wikilink">cloister</a> surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. The cloister was the heart of the abbey, where that the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of <a href="illuminated_manuscript" title="wikilink">illuminated manuscripts</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <img src="Eastrange.jpg" title="fig:The cloister showing the south transept of the church and the east range. The triple arches in the centre are the entrance to the chapter house." alt="The cloister showing the south transept of the church and the east range. The triple arches in the centre are the entrance to the chapter house." /> The east range, which was started at the same time as the church and probably took avout 10 years to build,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> contained many of the abbey's most important rooms. The vaulted library and <a href="sacristy" class="uri" title="wikilink">sacristy</a> were on the ground floor, adjacent to the church.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> To the south was the <a href="chapter_house" title="wikilink">chapter house</a>, where the government of the abbey took place and the monks met to transact business and to listen to a daily reading of a chapter of the <a href="Rule_of_St_Benedict" title="wikilink">Rule of St Benedict</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> It was a magnificent apartment divided into three aisles with vaults springing from four columns; a stone bench ran around the walls for the monks to sit on, and the abbot's throne was in the centre of the east wall. The entrance to the chapter house from the cloister is via an elaborately moulded arched doorway, flanked on each side by a window of similar size. The windows had sills and columns of <a href="Purbeck_Marble" title="wikilink">Purbeck Marble</a>, the whole forming an impressive composition appropriate to the second most important space in the abbey after the church.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The windows on either side of the door would have been unglazed, so as to allow representatives of the <a href="laybrother" title="wikilink">laybrothers</a> (who were not members of <a href="chapter_(religion)" title="wikilink">chapter</a>) to listen to debates.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="parlour" class="uri" title="wikilink">parlour</a> lies south, an austere, <a href="barrel_vault" title="wikilink">barrel vaulted</a> room little more than a passageway through the building.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the life of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks' day room and accommodation for novices,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> but as time went on it may have been converted into the <a href="misericord" class="uri" title="wikilink">misericord</a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> where the monks—initially only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole convent—could eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The monks' dormitory was on the top floor of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initilly the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping together for the common life changed,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into panelled chambers to give every monk his own private room, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, probably placed there so the brothers could guard it at night.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reredorter-and-infirmary">Reredorter and infirmary</h3>
<p><img src="Netrered.jpg" title="fig:Facade of the reredorter, with the windows of the Tudor long gallery on the left" alt="Facade of the reredorter, with the windows of the Tudor long gallery on the left" /> Another large building lies crosswise at the south end of the east range. The lower level consists of a vaulted hall. It is equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and has its own <a href="garderobe" class="uri" title="wikilink">garderobe</a>. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic <a href="Hospital" title="wikilink">infirmary</a>—if so it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The upper floor of this building was the <a href="reredorter" class="uri" title="wikilink">reredorter</a> or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks' dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the <a href="effluent" class="uri" title="wikilink">effluent</a> dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>To the west of the reredorter block was the buttery, a room where the monks' wine (some of it direct from the king's cellars at Southampton)<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have revealed fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer meat diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="south-range">South range</h3>
<p>During the Tudor conversion of the abbey to a house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the <a href="warming_house" title="wikilink">warming house</a> where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat to go to the <a href="refectory" class="uri" title="wikilink">refectory</a> or dining hall next door.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It is likely that, as at Netley's great sister house of <a href="Fountains_Abbey" title="wikilink">Fountains Abbey</a>, the chamber above the warming house was the <a href="muniment" class="uri" title="wikilink">muniment</a> room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, as well as those of local lords, were kept.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The refectory projected south from the centre of the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> It has been almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the brothers while they ate. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the monks' refectory and to the separate dining hall for the <a href="lay_brothers" title="wikilink">lay brothers</a> on the west side.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="west-range">West range</h3>
<p>The west range at Netley is small and does not run the full length of the west side of the cloister. It is divided in two by the original main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were few in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted the lay brothers' quarters to new uses.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> At some houses, such as <a href="Sawley_Abbey" title="wikilink">Sawley Abbey</a>, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as <a href="Hailes_Abbey" title="wikilink">Hailes Abbey</a>, the west range was turned into a luxurious private home for the abbot.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of the use these buildings were put to in the latter part of the medieval period.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>All the buildings around the cloister were finished in the fourteenth century.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period aside from the re-vaulting of the south transept of the church at the end of the fifteenth century.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> (as seen at <a href="Cleeve_Abbey" title="wikilink">Cleeve Abbey</a>) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="precinct">Precinct</h3>
<p><img src="Netleyabbotshouse.jpg" title="fig:The abbot&#39;s house with the church and cloister to the left" alt="The abbot&#39;s house with the church and cloister to the left" /> A stone building to the east of the main complex is thought to have been the <a href="abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">abbot</a>'s house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed the floors to be used independently if needed.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a precinct containing an outer (public) courtyard and an inner (private) courtyard, gardens, barns, guesthouses for travellers, stables, the home farm and industrial buildings. The site was defended by a high bank and moat, part of which remains east of the abbey. Entrance was strictly controlled by an outer and inner <a href="gatehouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">gatehouse</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> A chapel, known as the <em>capella ante portas</em> (<a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>: &quot;chapel outside the gates&quot;) was placed by the outer gatehouse for the use of travellers and the local community. Of the precinct buildings, only the abbot's house and the moat have left visible remains.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Netley's fresh water was supplied by two <a href="aqueduct" title="wikilink">aqueducts</a> which ran for several miles east and west of the abbey, up into the areas of modern Southampton and <a href="Eastleigh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eastleigh</a>. The remains of the eastern aqueduct, now known as Tickleford Gully, can be seen in Wentworth Gardens, Southampton.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="monastic-history">Monastic history</h2>
<p>Henry III added generously to the endowment left by Peter des Roches. The king donated farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of &lt;U+00A3&gt;81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost <a href="bankruptcy" title="wikilink">bankrupt</a>. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an <a href="administration_(business)" title="wikilink">administrator</a>, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, he was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants. enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties, but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered, and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Netley remained a much respected institution by its neighbours until the end of its life as a monastery. It was not known for scholarship, wealth, or particular fervour, but it was highly regarded for its generosity to travellers and sailors, and for the devout lives (&quot;by Raporte of good Religious conversation&quot;) led by its monks.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The abbot was summoned on many occasions to sit in <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> with fellow prelates in the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> as one of the <a href="Lords_Spiritual" title="wikilink">Lords Spiritual</a>. Surviving reports indicate the abbey had a peaceful and scandal-free domestic life.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dissolution">Dissolution</h2>

<p>Around 1700, Netley Abbey came into the hands of Sir Berkeley Lucy (also spelled Sir &quot;Bartlet&quot;) who decided in 1704 to demolish the by now unfashionable house in order to sell the materials. Sir Berkeley made an agreement with a Southampton builder, Mr Walter Taylor,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> to take down the former church. However, during the course of the demolition, the contractor was killed by the fall of <a href="tracery" class="uri" title="wikilink">tracery</a> from the west window of the church and the scheme was halted.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="netleysamnathbuck.jpg" title="fig:This print with hand-colouring by the antiquarian engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1732&lt;U+2013&gt;3 shows the abbey church fundamentally as it stands today." alt="This print with hand-colouring by the antiquarian engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1732&lt;U+2013&gt;3 shows the abbey church fundamentally as it stands today." /> The abbey was subsequently abandoned and allowed to decay. In the 1760s Thomas Drummer, who owned estates in the area, moved the north transept to his estate at Cranbury Park near <a href="Winchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winchester</a> where it can be still be seen as a <a href="folly" class="uri" title="wikilink">folly</a> in the gardens of the house.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>By the second half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then partially roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist <a href="Jane_Austen" title="wikilink">Jane Austen</a> was among those who visited)<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink took place in 1860.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> In 1922, the abbey was passed into state care by the then owner.

<h2 id="in-literature-and-art">In literature and art</h2>
<p>Soon after the abbey had been allowed to fall into ruin it began to attract the attention of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian <a href="Horace_Walpole" title="wikilink">Horace Walpole</a> praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet <a href="Thomas_Gray" title="wikilink">Thomas Gray</a>,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> claiming they were &quot;In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In 1764, George Keate wrote <em>The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem</em>, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> <img src="Transept1776.jpg" title="fig: A pair of gentlemen visit the ruined south transept in 1776. Of particular interest is the high vault of the church, which has since collapsed." alt=" A pair of gentlemen visit the ruined south transept in 1776. Of particular interest is the high vault of the church, which has since collapsed." /></p>
<p>Keate was followed by other romantic poets including <a href="William_Sotheby" title="wikilink">William Sotheby</a> (<em>Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight</em>, 1790).<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Sotheby&lt;U+2019&gt;s view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 <a href="Richard_Warner" title="wikilink">Richard Warner</a> wrote a potboiler entitled <em>Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story</em> in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of <a href="Richard_Harris_Barham" title="wikilink">Richard Harris Barham</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em><a href="Ingoldsby_Legends" title="wikilink">Ingoldsby Legends</a></em> (1847) covering Netley.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and thereby ensuring God&lt;U+2019&gt;s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins. Netley has its own opera, <em>Netley Abbey, an Operatic Farce</em>, by William Pearce, first shown in 1794 at <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Covent Garden</a>. The set of the first production featured an elaborate mockup of the abbey ruins seen in the moonlight.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest surviving depiction of the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Their engraving (1733) shows the church of the abbey very much as it is today, with the exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture shows some notable errors however, and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was <a href="John_Constable" title="wikilink">John Constable</a>, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it lurking among trees.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="present-day">Present day</h2>
<p>The visitor today will find the shell of the church and monastic buildings around the cloister plus the <a href="abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">abbot</a>'s house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot's house still have their vaults intact. Medieval <a href="heraldry" title="wikilink">heraldic</a> <a href="polychrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">polychrome</a> tiles found on the site can be seen in the sacristy,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> and Henry III's foundation stone remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of <a href="Netley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netley</a> and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Netley is an <a href="Scheduled_Monument" title="wikilink">Ancient Monument</a> protected by law.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

Legend has it that before starting the work he was warned in a dream that he would be punished if he committed sacrilege by damaging the building. The story is recounted by the eighteenth century <a href="antiquary" class="uri" title="wikilink">antiquary</a> Browne Walters:</p>

<p>The abbey is alleged to be home to two ghosts. The first is that of a monk who is seen as a white figure; the second is said to be a former abbot who appears as a dark figure.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>The story of the nun walled up in a small room recounted in Barham's <em><a href="Ingoldsby_Legends" title="wikilink">Ingoldsby Legends</a></em> was a creation of the author and has no basis in fact or genuine folklore, as the author himself admits with a smile in his notes to the poem, attributing his story to one James Harrison:</p>
