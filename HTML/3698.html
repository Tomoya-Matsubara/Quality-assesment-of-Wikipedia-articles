<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>At the time of its European discovery in 1524 by <a href="Giovanni_da_Verrazzano" title="wikilink">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a>, the region was inhabited by the <a href="Lenape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenape</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> But it was not until the voyage of <a href="Henry_Hudson" title="wikilink">Henry Hudson</a>, an <a href="England" title="wikilink">Englishman</a> hired by the <a href="Dutch_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">Dutch East India Company</a> to find a route to China, that the area was mapped.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He discovered <a href="Manhattan_Island" title="wikilink">Manhattan Island</a> on <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="1609" class="uri" title="wikilink">1609</a>, and continued up the river that bears his name, the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>, until he arrived at the site where New York State's capital city, <a href="Albany,_New_York" title="wikilink">Albany</a>, now stands. His aim to find a route to China had failed but what he had discovered was something even better, the largest natural harbor in the New World on the island of Manhattan and the third largest in the entire world.</p>
<p>Realizing the immense potential of this harbor, the Dutch settlement began with the founding of a <a href="fur_trade" title="wikilink">fur trading</a> settlement, later called &quot;<a href="New_Amsterdam" title="wikilink">New Amsterdam</a>,&quot; (<a href="Dutch_language" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>- &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;) on the southern tip of Manhattan in 1614. The initial settlers were not Dutch at all but Belgian and French Huguenots escaping religious persecution in Europe. Dutch colonial Director-General <a href="Peter_Minuit" title="wikilink">Peter Minuit</a> purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie Native Americans in 1626.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1664, the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British</a> conquered the city, and there by uniting their colonies in <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and renamed the city, &quot;New York&quot; after the English <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Duke of York</a>, the heir to the throne. <img src="Castelloplan.jpg" title="fig:Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of New Amsterdam" alt="Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of New Amsterdam" width="230" /> New York City grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule. In 1754, <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a> was founded under charter by <a href="King_George_II" title="wikilink">King George II</a> as King's College in Lower Manhattan. During the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>, the city emerged as the theater for a series of major battles known as the <a href="New_York_Campaign" title="wikilink">New York Campaign</a> which raged from <a href="1776" class="uri" title="wikilink">1776</a> through <a href="1777" class="uri" title="wikilink">1777</a>. The <a href="Congress_of_the_Confederation" title="wikilink">Congress of the Confederation</a> met in New York City from 1785 to 1789, and the city officially became the <a href="List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">capital</a> on <a href="September_13" title="wikilink">September 13</a>, <a href="1788" class="uri" title="wikilink">1788</a>. The first <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a>, <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a>, was inaugurated at <a href="Federal_Hall" title="wikilink">Federal Hall</a> on Wall Street in April 1789.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> New York City remained the capital until <a href="1790" class="uri" title="wikilink">1790</a>, when the Federal government relocated to <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>New York City quickly became the nation's dominant trading center when the <a href="Erie_Canal" title="wikilink">Erie Canal</a> was completed in 1825, connecting the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The <a href="Commissioners&#39;_Plan_of_1811" title="wikilink">Commissioners' Plan of 1811</a>, which created a rational street grid to encompass most of Manhattan, helped guide expansion of the city.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> By 1835, New York City had surpassed <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> as the largest city in the United States, with <a href="immigration" class="uri" title="wikilink">immigration</a> playing an important role in growth. The <a href="Irish_Potato_Famine" title="wikilink">Irish Potato Famine</a> brought a large influx of <a href="Irish_people" title="wikilink">Irish</a> immigrants, and by 1850, the Irish comprised one quarter of the city's population.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Government institutions, including the <a href="New_York_City_Police_Department" title="wikilink">New York City Police Department</a> and the <a href="New_York_City_Department_of_Education" title="wikilink">public schools</a>, were established in the 1840s and 1850s to respond to growing demands of residents.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Public-minded members of the old merchant aristocracy pressed for <a href="Central_Park" title="wikilink">Central Park</a>, which became the first landscaped park in an American city in 1857. Local politics fell under the domination of <a href="Tammany_Hall" title="wikilink">Tammany Hall</a>, a <a href="political_machine" title="wikilink">political machine</a> supported by Irish immigrants. <img src="Old_timer_structural_worker.jpg" title="fig:Construction of the Empire State Building, 1930." alt="Construction of the Empire State Building, 1930." width="230" /> Anger at military conscription during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> (1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1865) led to the <a href="New_York_Draft_Riots" title="wikilink">Draft Riots of 1863</a>, one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history. Eleven black men were lynched over a five day period, and hundreds of blacks forced out of the city.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1898 the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan and municipalities in the other boroughs. The opening of the <a href="New_York_City_Subway" title="wikilink">New York City Subway</a> in 1904 helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1911 the <a href="Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire" title="wikilink">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire</a>, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the <a href="International_Ladies&#39;_Garment_Workers&#39;_Union" title="wikilink">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union</a> and major improvements in factory safety standards.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <img src="Wtc_arial_march2001.jpg" title="fig:World Trade Center in March 2001" alt="World Trade Center in March 2001" width="200" /> In the 1920s, New York City was a major destination for <a href="African_Americans" title="wikilink">African Americans</a> during the <a href="Great_Migration_(African_American)" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a> from the American South. By 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The <a href="Harlem_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Harlem Renaissance</a> flourished during the era of <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Prohibition</a>, and coincident with a larger economic boom that saw the construction of a skyline filled with competing <a href="skyscrapers" class="uri" title="wikilink">skyscrapers</a>. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, which had reigned for a century. The difficult years of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> saw the election of reformer <a href="Fiorello_LaGuardia" title="wikilink">Fiorello LaGuardia</a> and the fall of <a href="Tammany_Hall" title="wikilink">Tammany Hall</a> after eighty years of political dominance.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> veterans and immigrants from Europe created a postwar economic boom and the development of huge housing tracts in eastern Queens. Ironically, the city's prosperity would lead many middle class residents to the new suburban developments in <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> such as <a href="Levittown,_New_York" title="wikilink">Levittown</a>, aided by the bridges and thoroughfairs constructed under <a href="Robert_Moses" title="wikilink">Robert Moses</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> New York emerged from the war unscathed and the leading city of the world, with <a href="Wall_Street" title="wikilink">Wall Street</a> leading America's rise as the world's dominant economic power. In 1952, the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> established its headquarters in New York City. The rise of <a href="Abstract_Expressionism" title="wikilink">Abstract Expressionism</a> in the city made New York an important center of the art world.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Like many large American cities, New York suffered a decline in manufacturing and rising crime rates, race riots, and <a href="white_flight" title="wikilink">white flight</a> in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a crime-ridden relic of history. In the 1980s, a resurgence in the financial industry improved the city's fiscal health. By the 1990s, racial tensions had calmed, crime rates dropped dramatically, and waves of new immigrants arrived from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as <a href="Silicon_Alley" title="wikilink">Silicon Alley</a>, emerged in the city's economy and New York's population reached an all-time high in the <a href="United_States_Census_2000" title="wikilink">2000 census</a>. The city was one of the sites of the <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, when nearly 3,000 people died in the destruction of the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>.
