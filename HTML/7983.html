<p>'''Syed Masood ''' is a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> from the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap opera</a> <em><a href="EastEnders" class="uri" title="wikilink">EastEnders</a></em>, played by <a href="Marc_Elliott" title="wikilink">Marc Elliott</a>, and first appeared on screen on 21 April 2009.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<p>Syed is the son of characters <a href="Masood_Ahmed" title="wikilink">Masood Ahmed</a> (<a href="Nitin_Ganatra" title="wikilink">Nitin Ganatra</a>) and <a href="Zainab_Masood" title="wikilink">Zainab Masood</a> (<a href="Nina_Wadia" title="wikilink">Nina Wadia</a>) and brother of <a href="Tamwar_Masood" title="wikilink">Tamwar</a> (<a href="Himesh_Patel" title="wikilink">Himesh Patel</a>) and <a href="Shabnam_Masood" title="wikilink">Shabnam</a> (<a href="Zahra_Ahmadi" title="wikilink">Zahra Ahmadi</a>). He had been mentioned regularly since the Masoods arrived in Walford in 2007, but was not introduced on-screen until April 2009. Elliott was cast in the role after a successful reading with Ganatra and Wadia. Eliott was told he had been successfully cast just before Christmas 2008.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with entertainment and media website <a href="Digital_Spy" title="wikilink">Digital Spy</a>, Elliott commented on his casting, and the &quot;responsibility&quot; with regard to playing a character that viewers already had preconceived images about: &quot;I hope I'm what everyone expects! I was given a biography when I got the part [...]. It's a process all characters go through to decide what they'd do in certain situations, given certain choices and basic things, for example who they'd like or dislike on [[Albert Square|[Albert] Square]]. That helped to cement the character in my head [...]. He's such a complex character. It's such a collaborative experience. I'm discovering things about Syed at the same time as the rest of the team.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> To prepare for the role, Elliott watched documentaries such as <em><a href="A_Jihad_for_Love" title="wikilink">A Jihad for Love</a></em> which focus on the ways in which gay Muslims reconcile their faith with their sexuality.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Elliott's character is apparently a smooth-talking natural charmer who knows how to get ahead in business. He is also described as &quot;handsome, suave and sophisticated&quot;. Executive Producer <a href="Diederick_Santer" title="wikilink">Diederick Santer</a> described Syed as &quot;Entrepreneurial, reckless, dashing and complicated, [he's] set to bring surprises and chaos to the Masood family.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Elliott revealed that the character is driven by money: &quot;It's all about the cash. His drive is to be successful and there's nothing really <a href="Machiavellian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Machiavellian</a> about him &lt;U+2014&gt; well, there potentially is &lt;U+2014&gt; but he just wants the money because he believes he can use it to make more. [Syed]'s very cocksure and confident about himself but the absurd thing is that he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He also says that &quot;Syed manipulates people to his own ends. He's charming, confident and reckless.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Wadia described the character as a &quot;dark horse&quot;, saying, &quot;What I like about the way they've introduced him is that you get to see the gentle side of him first &lt;U+2014&gt; the repentant side. Then you see what he's really like over the subsequent weeks.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Shortly after his arrival, Syed's girlfriend, <a href="Amira_Shah" title="wikilink">Amira Shah</a>, was introduced played by <a href="Preeya_Kalidas" title="wikilink">Preeya Kalidas</a>. Elliott has described the relationship between the characters and Syed's motivation: &quot;Well, she's a rich daddy's girl and it's hard not to make the association between Syed and money. There's certainly an honest attraction there and I think he does love her. But the money that her father has might be an additional aspect of their relationship. Amira comes in and ruffles a few feathers, especially Zainab's. Obviously with Syed being a mummy's boy, she has to have her say. I don't think Zainab would be happy with anyone that Syed's with &lt;U+2014&gt; they'd have to be absolutely perfect. Mummy Masood will be doing a lot of meddling and locking horns with Amira.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 2009, Syed begins an affair with gay character <a href="Christian_Clarke" title="wikilink">Christian Clarke</a>, played by <a href="John_Partridge_(performer)" title="wikilink">John Partridge</a>, a storyline that will see Syed &quot;torn between his feelings and [his] faith&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The storyline is said to be controversial, as <a href="Homosexuality_and_Islam" title="wikilink">homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, Santer explained that the storyline will not be a moral tale, but one of human interest, adding: &quot;In this regard, it's not dissimilar to the story we told when <a href="Dot_Cotton" title="wikilink">Dot Cotton</a>'s deeply-held Christian beliefs came into conflict with her desire to alleviate <a href="Ethel_Skinner" title="wikilink">Ethel</a>'s suffering [in a <a href="euthanasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">euthanasia</a> plotline]. To all intents and purposes, Syed's a 'good' Muslim man: he doesn't drink, smoke or engage in sex before marriage. But he struggles with his sexuality when he finds himself drawn to Christian and he believes this goes against his faith. This is not a story about Syed and Christian's physical relationship &lt;U+2014&gt; we don't see anything beyond one kiss. It's more about the inner turmoil and conflict Syed endures trying to remain true to his faith while questioning his sexuality. Syed has already been ostracised from his family and community once and if he's true to his heart he risks losing his family again.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Santer also said that <em>EastEnders</em> always tries to &quot;reflect modern life in multicultural Britain and [tell] social issue stories relevant to [its] diverse audience,&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and that &quot;The dynamics of Muslim relationships and families are not radically different from any others but the importance that Muslim culture places on family and married life can make the same issues more charged.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Elliott commented on the storyline, saying: &quot;I think <em>EastEnders</em> would be doing the programme a disservice if they didn't give a voice to various communities. I think that's really important because I think London is a very ethnically diverse multicultural place, and <em>EastEnders</em> has a job to reflect that in the storylines it gives people and the characters they have on board.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This plot was researched with help from academics, gay Muslim support groups and members of the <a href="Muslim_Council_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Muslim Council of Great Britain</a>, and will contain a &quot;balance of opinions&quot; from various other characters, including Syed's mother Zainab.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>When asked in a BBC interview in September 2009 if Syed is gay or bisexual, Elliott answered: &quot;I think at this stage there's confusion about his sexuality. He knows he likes Christian but it hasn't really been stipulated. He wants to settle down and have children with Amira because that's what's expected of him, but he finds himself unavoidably attracted to Christian so that's what's going on in his head.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He went on to say that Syed is still attracted to Amira but only because &quot;that's what he&lt;U+2019&gt;s meant to do&quot;, adding that &quot;he's probably conning himself.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Christian's friend <a href="James_Mackie_(EastEnders)" title="wikilink">James Mackie</a>, played by <a href="Paul_Keating_(actor)" title="wikilink">Paul Keating</a> arrives and when Syed refuses to break up with Amira, Christian starts a relationship with James to make Syed jealous. Elliott says that this is the moment when Syed realises his feelings for Christian go beyond sexual attraction.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Elliot explains that Syed and Amira have never been intimate, in theory because of their religion, but adds that Syed is probably scared to get intimate with her and is merely hiding behind his religion.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite storyline of the year had been. He replied &quot;I'm really pleased with the Christian/Syed storyline. It's bold and we thought long and hard before we did it to make sure we got it right and I'm really proud with what we've done. Marc [Elliott] and John [Partridge] have absolutely stepped up to the plate and like all good <em>EastEnders</em> stories, we're not even half done with it yet. There's miles to go.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Syed and Amira's wedding takes place on screen on 1 January 2010. They have a traditional Pakistani wedding featuring horses, drummers and dancers. Scriptwriters researched by watching videos of a real British Pakistani wedding. <a href="BBC_Asian_Network" title="wikilink">BBC Asian Network</a> reporter Shabnam Mahmood also advised on the wedding. The wedding and its build-up were filmed over a two-week period and Elliott required three two-hour riding lessons before he could film the horseback scenes. He revealed: &quot;I was quite proud of myself, though, as I managed to canter although I don't do that around the Square as it's not that big. During rehearsals the horse, Storm, was really well behaved and it all went fairly smoothly. But as soon as it came to the actual filming and all the drums and banners came out, it wasn't so easy. I think she walks sideways for quite a bit of the time. But I'm just pleased that I didn't end up impaled on the railings in Albert Square. I think avoiding that was quite an achievement.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> John Partridge choreographed the dance scenes and Elliott took six weeks to learn the dance, saying: &quot;I couldn't have done it without him [Partridge]. He had me practising in every spare moment, even in the hallways by myself as he wanted to see a marked improvement on my routine. Preeya kept getting occasional glimpses of me practising in the hallways and she didn't look too impressed with what she saw. Johnny did a great job with that routine, although I added in the back flip myself! By the end of it, I ate, slept and dreamt that dance.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the wedding, Syed's affair with Christian is revealed to his mother Zainab and he admits to her that he is gay.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> She urges him to go ahead with the wedding and only a small number of people know about Syed and Christian. Elliot said he was pleased that the affair came out this way, as &quot;it's far more realistic this way&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He added that the writers would have &quot;done the story a disservice&quot; if Syed and Christian had ended up with their 'happily ever after', saying &quot;they need to show the life after the wedding and show how Syed will cope living with a wife who he loves, but not in the way he loves Christian. He has to live with the fact that he's not being true to himself over his sexuality.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Elliott noted a change in Syed's personality, saying &quot;Syed's starting to show signs of being quite a cruel character but it's only through his own bitterness and resentment that he starts acting the way he does &lt;U+2013&gt; it's the way he deals with it. Poor Amira's none the wiser, so Syed's not acting right and she has no idea why.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011, a <a href="LGBT_parenting" title="wikilink">same-sex parenting</a> storyline which sees Christian and Syed finding a <a href="surrogacy" title="wikilink">surrogate mother</a> was reported by the <em><a href="Daily_Mirror" title="wikilink">Daily Mirror</a></em>. If true, it will form one of the year's biggest plots, expected to controversial and a ratings hit.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>Syed's backstory was revealed in an interview with Elliott: &quot;Syed's been away from his family for the last four years because his dad Masood told him never to darken the family's doorstep again. His dad took the blame for Syed stealing money from the family business and nearly bankrupting them. All this time, Zainab thought that Masood was responsible for their financial problems. To honour his father's wishes, Syed respectfully went away. He's been up north around the Manchester/Leeds area trying to build a property empire. Initially, he was working for an estate agent, but then tried to go out on his own as a property developer. But there's some debate over how successful he's been&lt;U+2026&gt;&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Syed is mentioned regularly in the first few weeks of his family's arrival in 2007, and Zainab invites him to have dinner with the family but he does not turn up, much to her disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="u2014">2009&lt;U+2014&gt;</h3>
<p>In February 2009, Syed contacts his brother Tamwar, needing money. His parents Zainab and Masood find out, and Masood reveals that the reason he banished Syed four years ago was because he stole money from a previous family business, which caused it to go bankrupt. Despite this, Zainab starts secretly meeting Syed. Masood learns of this and goes to confront him. Syed begs his father for forgiveness but refuses to apologise for Masood taking the blame for his past actions. Syed declares that he is a now a successful property developer, but his landlord comes in, revealing that Syed has not paid his rent. Syed reluctantly reveals that he has no money and will lose his flat if he does not pay his rent. Masood tells Syed he should have told the truth instead of trying to con his family, and leaves him. Syed subsequently turns up in Walford, revealing that he is homeless, and Zainab soon asks him to move into the family home. Syed's girlfriend Amira comes to dinner, and Tamwar tells her Syed does not have any money. She insults the family and the couple break up. Amira soon returns, saying her father has vanished and her house has been repossessed. The couple reunite, with Amira settling in Walford, close to Syed.</p>
<p>At work, Syed gets into an argument with his co-worker <a href="Christian_Clarke" title="wikilink">Christian Clarke</a> (<a href="John_Partridge_(performer)" title="wikilink">John Partridge</a>), over Christian's <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a> and how it conflicts with Syed's Muslim faith. This leads to Syed kissing Christian unexpectedly. Soon after this, they end up sleeping together. Syed tells Christian he has had <a href="one-night_stand" title="wikilink">one-night stands</a> with men before. Christian tries to convince Syed they are meant for each other, but Syed wants to be a good Muslim, so he proposes to Amira, leaving Christian shocked. Syed struggles with his feelings, and tells the <a href="imam" class="uri" title="wikilink">imam</a> at his mosque that he has feelings for another man. Though the imam warns Syed that homosexuality is forbidden in Islam, he continues to see Christian. The pair share a kiss in an alley way, not knowing that someone has seen them. When Syed returns home, the words &quot;bad boy&quot; are painted on his front door. Syed and Christian are seen together again, this time photographed on a camera phone. Syed receives this photograph, and further messages, and suspects Tamwar, <a href="Ian_Beale" title="wikilink">Ian Beale</a> (<a href="Adam_Woodyatt" title="wikilink">Adam Woodyatt</a>), and even Christian of being the culprit. Syed then receives a text message demanding money, and despite Christian's advice, he pays the ransom to the anonymous blackmailer. Christian discovers it was his step-niece, <a href="Lucy_Beale" title="wikilink">Lucy Beale</a> (<a href="Melissa_Suffield" title="wikilink">Melissa Suffield</a>). Syed warns her not to tell anyone about the relationship. At <a href="Denise_Johnson" title="wikilink">Denise</a> (<a href="Diane_Parish" title="wikilink">Diane Parish</a>) and <a href="Lucas_Johnson" title="wikilink">Lucas Johnson</a>'s (<a href="Don_Gilet" title="wikilink">Don Gilet</a>) wedding reception, a drunk Christian tells a stunned Syed that he loves him. A few days later, Christian tells Syed again that he loves him and Syed says the same back. That night, Masood crashes his car and the next day Syed tells Christian that he was forced into saying he loves him and he is being punished. He says their relationship is wrong and it is over between them. Christian is meant to be dance organiser for Syed and Amira's wedding, but he turns up late to the rehearsal and tells Syed he can have nothing to do with the wedding. Amira gets money from her father, <a href="Qadim_Shah" title="wikilink">Qadim</a> (<a href="Ramon_Tikaram" title="wikilink">Ramon Tikaram</a>), and she and Syed make plans for their future. Christian's sister <a href="Jane_Beale" title="wikilink">Jane Beale</a> (<a href="Laurie_Brett" title="wikilink">Laurie Brett</a>) discovers their affair, and she advises Christian not to break Syed and Amira's relationship. On Christmas Eve, Christian tells Syed he cannot see him with Amira any longer and has got a one-way ticket abroad, but asks Syed to come with him. Christian thinks Syed has chosen to come with him but Amira turns up as well and Christian leaves on his own. Two days later, Amira comments that Syed misses Christian. Syed tries to deny it but Amira says she misses him too. Syed asks Lucy how Christian is and she says he is in Barcelona and is not coming back. She sarcastically wishes him luck with the wedding.</p>
<p>On the day of Syed's and Amira's <a href="Mehndi#Mehndi_celebration" title="wikilink">Mehndi</a>, Lucy continues to make comments about Christian in front of Syed. He says it is not his fault Christian left and he is glad he has gone as he can get on with his life but Lucy calls him a liar. Jane enters and when Syed leaves, she reveals to Lucy that she knows about Christian and Syed's affair. Lucy is shocked and hints that she is going to tell Amira and Syed's family about the affair but Jane threatens to make Lucy's life hell if she does. At the Mehndi, Lucy continues to openly look down on Syed and Amira asks Jane about Christian. Jane explains that he is in Spain and Amira asks her to convince him to come to the wedding. Syed comments, saying they are not that important to Christian, which annoys her and she walks off.</p>
<p>At a New Year's Eve party, Christian turns up and kisses Syed moments before midnight. Syed demands to know why he came back and he says he tried to forget but he needs him. Amira comes in saying she knew Christian would not let them down. Syed says he loves Amira and they kiss, upsetting Christian, who later tells Jane he will make sure there is no wedding. On the wedding day, Christian summons Syed to the caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; where Syed admits he is gay and that he loves him but cannot come out because he is not just gay, but a son, brother and friend, as well as a Muslim. When he runs out of the caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; distressed, Zainab sees and confronts Christian who tells her everything. She does not believe him and attacks him verbally and physically. She then goes to the wedding and confronts Syed who eventually confesses that he is gay and in love with Christian. Zainab is devastated and tells Syed he should have tried harder with Amira. Syed tells his mother that he cannot control his feelings. Despite everything, Zainab tells him to marry Amira. As Syed and Amira say their vows, Christian interrupts the ceremony, but the wedding still goes ahead. Afterwards, Syed apologises to a heartbroken Christian and thanks Zainab for not saying anything. Syed and Amira go honeymooning in the Maldives. When they return, Syed discovers, to his disappointment, that Christian is seeing another man.</p>
<p>Syed and Amira have not consummated their marriage after a month, so Amira tries to get Syed in the mood by dressing up at the Masala Queen unit. Syed tells her to cover up as anybody could come in and see her. She leaves, meets <a href="Danny_Mitchell_(EastEnders)" title="wikilink">Danny Mitchell</a> (<a href="Liam_Bergin" title="wikilink">Liam Bergin</a>), and they kiss. Later, Amira sleeps on the sofa and tells Zainab it is because Syed kicks her in his sleep. Zainab books Syed a doctor's appointment but he calls her stupid as she knows the real reason Amira is sleeping downstairs. Zainab tells him to go to mosque as it is a test, but he says the thought of sex with Amira makes him feel physically sick. He says he cannot live his whole life like that and has to tell Amira as it is not fair on her. Zainab says it would not be fair on the family as they will be shamed. Amira overhears her saying she will disown Syed, so asks what they are talking about and Syed says there is something she does not know. However, Zainab tells him not to say anything, and he leaves. Zainab makes up a story, and when Amira talks to Syed again, she tells him it is obvious that he does not find her attractive. She reveals she kissed Danny, but says she hates herself for it and cries. Syed comforts her and says he is nervous about having sex with her, so they agree to take their time. However, after Syed confronts Danny, he takes Amira to bed and says they might be a proper family in nine months.</p>
<p>After the birth of Syed's brother <a href="Kamil_Masood" title="wikilink">Kamil</a>, Syed again talks to Amira about having a baby, and she stops him as he grows amorous. He follows her into the kitchen and is shocked to discover she is taking the contraceptive pills. She says a baby was Zainab's idea, not hers, and she is not ready for the responsibility of motherhood, but Syed tells her he cannot trust her. They later both agree to wait to try for a baby, but after spending time with Kamil, Amira tells Syed she is feeling broody and throws her pills away. In April, Amira's father Qadim sends money, so Syed and Amira decides to buy a flat together. This causes much tension between Christian and Syed. While Zainab offers to help him decorate the flat, until interrupted by Christian who declares that he is still in love with Syed and that he wants him back and vowing that he intends to. Despite insisting that he wants to stay with Amira, Syed eventually gives in to his feelings. After Masood gives Syed his Qu'ran that has been in the family for several generations, saying he is proud of him, he sees Syed and Christian kissing on the floor of Syed and Amira's flat. However, he tells Syed he only saw Christian with another man and tells Syed to change the locks. Masood takes advice from the imam, but as he is about to confront Syed, Amira and Syed announce that she is pregnant.</p>
<p>Syed overhears his parents talking about how he will disgrace the family, and confronts them, saying he will make his own choice. He tells Christian he loves Amira and wants to be a family and continue seeing Christian in secret, but Christian is not happy with this. Amira reveals to Syed that she is not pregnant so they decide to try again, but as they enter the bedroom, Amira sees the words &quot;Syed loves Christian&quot; painted on the wall, as Christian had uncovered a message previously painted by Lucy. Syed denies it, but Christian walks in a tells Amira the truth. After she breaks down, the Masoods vow to keep it a secret between themselves, but when Christian arrives at the flatwarming party, Amira breaks down. Syed admits he is gay and is attacked by Qadim. He then says he rejects everyone including Christian. As Syed tries to tell Amira that he still loves her, she hands her wedding ring back to him, telling him she hopes he and Christian will be very happy together. She leaves Walford, and unknown to Syed or his family, Amira is carrying his child as she got her test mixed up with <a href="Chelsea_Fox" title="wikilink">Chelsea Fox</a>'s (<a href="Tiana_Benjamin" title="wikilink">Tiana Benjamin</a>). The following morning, Syed disappears from his own apartment, and it is not until then that Zainab realises she misses him. Masood throws Zainab out of the house after discovering that she already knew about the affair, and Syed arrives to help her. He attempts to make amends with his father, saying that he will never speak to Christian again. He also returns Masood's Qu'ran, saying he does not deserve it but will one day. Later, Tamwar tells him that Christian has been beaten up, to which Syed acts as if he does not care.</p>
<p>Syed meets with his family and Masood says they must put things behind them. Syed asks Tamwar who attacked Christian, and Tamwar confirms that it was Qadim. Syed then visits Christian, who calls him a coward before saying that he never wants to see him again. As he exits the flat, Masood and Zainab see him and are upset that he broke his promise. Syed is later seen at his flat breaking a <a href="Misbaha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Misbaha</a> in anger. He tries to find work and is offered a market stall by <a href="Mr_Lister" title="wikilink">Mr Lister</a> (Nick Wilton) but <a href="Roxy_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Roxy Mitchell</a> (<a href="Rita_Simons" title="wikilink">Rita Simons</a>) tells Lister that it is Syed's fault that Christian was attacked, so Syed storms out, back to his flat. The next day he goes to the mosque where <a href="Nadim_Abbasi" title="wikilink">Nadim Abbasi</a> (Kriss Dosanjh) tells him to find a new mosque. When he goes home, he buys vodka and starts to get drunk. Roxy visits him and asks him to leave Walford, so he orders her out. As he drinks, he spots a bottle of pills and is soon found unconscious by Masood and is taken to hospital. When Syed opens his eyes, Zainab tells him that it would be better if he was dead, just as Masood and Tamwar walk in. Masood orders Zainab out and later, Syed is discharged, but when Masood brings him home, Zainab has put all his belongings in the street and she sets fire to them in front of her family. However, Masood convinces her to invite Syed back home. He returns to a warm welcome from Masood and Tamwar, but Zainab avoids hugging him.</p>
<p>Zainab and Masood are suspicious when they see that Syed has erased his Internet browsing history and Masood thinks he is seeing another man when he sees him talking to <a href="List_of_EastEnders_characters_(2010)#Allen_Conlon" title="wikilink">Allen Conlon</a> (Peter Vollebregt). However, Syed introduces his family to Allen, who claims he can cure Syed of his same-sex attraction. After several weeks of therapy, Syed tells Christian that he has been cured and no longer feels anything for him. However, when he returns to Allen, he says the therapy has not worked and he wants a quicker cure because he still wants to be with Christian. Syed returns home in tears but tells his family the therapy is going well. He admits to Tamwar that he still loves Christian and must pray as hard as he can. Masood joins them in prayer but Syed cries again. The next day Masood and Zainab keep Syed indoors, and he hears from Tamwar that Masood punched Christian after saying he loves Syed in ways Masood and Zainab will never understand. Syed visits Christian and admits his feelings, however, Christian rejects him and closes the door on him. The following day, Masood returns his Qu'ran to Syed, saying he finally deserves it. However, Syed hands it to Tamwar and leaves to find Christian. Syed tells Christian he chooses him, and that he is both gay and Muslim. Zainab and Masood see Syed and Christian together and Zainab appears upset. Syed moves in with Christian, and they later show Masood and Zainab they are a proper couple by holding hands in public. However Syed worries about their public displays of affection when a salesman makes a light-hearted joke about them being a couple. Syed runs off, but Christian explains it was a joke. Christian then becomes interested in learning about Syed's religion, but Syed is reluctant to talk about it. Syed is angry when he discovers Christian attempted to visit the mosque, however, Christian explains that he was just curious, and Syed says although he was stupid for visiting the mosque, he loves him for it. When Syed offers his condolences to Denise Johnson for what has happened to her and her family, Zainab does not acknowledge that he is there.</p>
<p>Syed decides to get back into property development but changes his mind when he realises he dislikes his prospective colleagues, so Christian asks him to become his personal assistant. He then finds a new mosque. Tamwar asks him to record a video message for Shabnam to update her on life in Walford, and he tells his sister he has found love with Christian. He then plays back Zainab's message, and sees she has neglected to acknowledge his existence, so deletes his own message. A few weeks later, during the fire at <a href="The_Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">The Queen Victoria</a>, Syed is knocked to the floor and trampled as the pub is evacuated. Realising he is nowhere to be seen, Zainab and Masood return to the burning building to rescue their son. Despite this intervention, Syed's parents continue to ignore him. Trying to move on with his life, Syed starts his own massage business. He discovers that his father almost had an affair with Jane Beale, and is angry with Christian for not telling him. He also learns that his parents have banned Tamwar from seeing his girlfriend <a href="Afia_Khan" title="wikilink">Afia Khan</a> (Meryl Fernandes). Syed confronts his father, and orders him to allow Tamwar to see Afia, or he will reveal everything to Zainab. Masood refuses, but Syed decides against telling his mother, for now.</p>
<p>Syed finds out that Christian shared a kiss with another man at the New Year's Eve party in The Queen Victoria. Christian tries to assure him that it meant nothing but Syed is angry and does not believe him. However, after Syed speaks to Jane, he is able to forgive Christian. They decide that they would like a child, although Syed is at first against the idea. A drunken Roxy offers to be the <a href="surrogate_mother" title="wikilink">surrogate mother</a> and although Syed tells Christian that it is happening too quickly, it is too late as Roxy has already impregnanted herself with Christian's sperm.</p>

<p>Critically, both Syed's gay storyline and Marc Elliot's acting were well received, with Elliot winning Best Newcomer at <a href="The_British_Soap_Awards" title="wikilink">The British Soap Awards</a> in 2010.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> From its inception, however, Syed's gay storyline was criticised by Asghar Bokhari of the <a href="Muslim_Public_Affairs_Committee" title="wikilink">Muslim Public Affairs Committee</a>, who said &quot;The Muslim community deserves a character that represents them to the wider public because <a href="Islamophobia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islamophobia</a> is so great right now. There's a lack of understanding of Muslims already and I think <em>EastEnders</em> really lost an opportunity to present a normal friendly Muslim character to the British public.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> One British Muslim fan of <em>EastEnders</em> reportedly told the <a href="Al_Arabiya" title="wikilink">Al Arabiya</a> news channel that the storyline &quot;is not a true reflection of the majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom.&quot; However the comments left by readers of this article are for the most part in favour of the storyline.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Another British Muslim said &quot;I think it's bad, it is going to give a bad impression about Islam. The type of people that watch <em>EastEnders</em> are going to be very na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve about such a portrayal of Muslims,&quot; but added that Muslims probably would not boycott the show as &quot;generally practicing Muslims don't really watch <em>EastEnders</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Diederick Santer responded to the criticisms of Muslim viewers by saying &quot;It's really important that [...] we give the Masoods big stories. Sometimes there's a danger of being too careful with black or Asian characters that we might go into territories that might offend. But it seems to me if we steer away from any controversy, they don't stand a chance of being a great <em>EastEnders</em> family &lt;U+2014&gt; they'll just be in their kitchen unit making curries for years and years and that's not going to be very interesting.&quot; Yusuf Wehebi from <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> Muslim advocacy group <a href="Imaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imaan</a> said: &quot;It is high time that the invisible minority became a visible minority. It is entirely possible to be Muslim and gay and there [are] many of us in Britain today. It is great that the BBC have had the courage to raise such an important social issue in our society today.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The kiss between Syed and Christian was watched by 7.9 million viewers.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="Anila_Baig" title="wikilink">Anila Baig</a> of <em><a href="The_Sun_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> wrote that the kiss was a &quot;<a href="Squib_(explosive)#Origin_of_the_phrase_&quot;damp_squib&quot;" title="wikilink">damp squib</a>&quot; and &quot;unconvincing&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Elliott told <em><a href="Soaplife" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soaplife</a></em> magazine that he has received no negative feedback from the show's fans for the storyline.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1 January 2010 episode in which Syed marries Amira received overnight ratings of 11.64 million viewers, an average audience share of 39.3%. The ultimate five minutes of the episode, in which Christian and Syed share an emotional goodbye, received a peak of 12.34 million viewers.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The wedding was criticised by a writer for Asian Image, who said &quot;With so much resources at hand they couldn't even get a Muslim wedding right. It was colourful and noisy but the priest couldn't speak the lingo properly and the wedding vows were all wrong. What was the priest doing sat between the bride and groom? At least attempt to make it as realistic as possible. It was Indian and then Pakistani &lt;U+2013&gt; what on earth was going on! For a prime-time show which was watched by millions at least try to get as close to a real Pakistani Muslim wedding as possible. The whole thing reminded me of one of 1960s botched jobs put together by some middle-aged white man who 'thought it happened this way so it must!'&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> A <a href="Channel_Five" title="wikilink">Channel Five</a> retrospective on soap weddings in 2010, however, deemed the &quot;dramatic <a href="Bollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bollywood</a>-style wedding&quot; to be &quot;spectacular&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2010, viewers complained after Syed was seen dropping his Qu'ran in frustration. The BBC responded by saying &quot;It was not intended to be a disrespectful act, rather a totally spontaneous one, symbolic of Syed's utter confusion and frustration at what feels like an impossible situation. It wasn't our intention to cause any offence.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Additionally, <a href="Ofcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ofcom</a> received 23 complaints from viewers who said the gay Muslim storyline was offensive to their faith.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In the same month, the Syed-Christian storyline was commented on in <a href="Stonewall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stonewall</a> research, which found that positive and realistic gay characters appear in just 0.6% of broadcast television.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Stonewall noted the romance storyline was a predominantly violent and unhappy one.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Among readers of <em><a href="Inside_Soap" title="wikilink">Inside Soap</a></em>, Syed and Christian came second in a poll of characters favoured to marry on-screen in 2011.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="response-from-previous-cast-members">Response from previous cast members</h3>
<p>Syed, along with the rest of the Masood family, was criticised by actor <a href="Deepak_Verma" title="wikilink">Deepak Verma</a>, who played <a href="Sanjay_Kapoor_(EastEnders)" title="wikilink">Sanjay Kapoor</a> between 1993 and 1998. He said that <em>EastEnders</em> had failed to portray Asian families in a realistic manner, branding the family &quot;two-dimensional and ill-conceived&quot;. A BBC spokesperson responded by saying &quot;It's a shame Deepak feels that way but that's clearly his personal opinion. The Masood family have proved to be hugely popular with <em>EastEnders</em> viewers.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> During Syed's gay storyline, actor <a href="Jimi_Mistry" title="wikilink">Jimi Mistry</a>, who played gay Asian character <a href="Fred_Fonseca" title="wikilink">Fred Fonseca</a> in <em>EastEnders</em> between 1998 and 2000, expressed surprise in October 2009 at another gay Asian storyline in the programme. Mistry said &quot;It's amazing, isn't it? It was ten years ago when we did it and they're still going down that path. I can't really comment though. I did my stint and I did see they were going along that road again but it's their choice. They must think that people have forgotten the last time they did it, so maybe they're just redoing it in a different way.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
