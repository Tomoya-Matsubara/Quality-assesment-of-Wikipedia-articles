<p><strong>John Douglas</strong> (11 April 1830 &lt;U+2013&gt; 23 May 1911) was an English <a href="architect" class="uri" title="wikilink">architect</a> who designed about 500 buildings in Cheshire, North Wales and northwest England, in particular in the estate of <a href="Eaton_Hall_(Cheshire)" title="wikilink">Eaton Hall</a>. He was trained in <a href="Lancaster,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a> and practised throughout his career from an office in <a href="Chester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chester</a>, <a href="Cheshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheshire</a>. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants.</p>
<p>Douglas' output included new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, and a variety of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival</a>, and many of his works incorporate elements of the <a href="English_Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">English Gothic</a> style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Netherlandish architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of <a href="Vernacular_architecture" title="wikilink">vernacular</a> elements in his buildings, in particular <a href="Timber_framing" title="wikilink">half-timbering</a>, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, <a href="pargeting" class="uri" title="wikilink">pargeting</a>, and the use of decorative brick in <a href="Diaper_(architecture)" title="wikilink">diapering</a> and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas' use of <a href="joiner" title="wikilink">joinery</a> and highly detailed wood carving.</p>
<p>Throughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the <a href="Duke_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Grosvenor</a> family of Eaton Hall. Most of his works have survived, particularly his churches. The city of Chester contains a number of his structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and <a href="Eastgate_Clock" title="wikilink">Eastgate Clock</a>. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of <a href="Eccleston,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Eccleston</a>, <a href="Aldford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldford</a> and <a href="Pulford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pulford</a>.</p>

<p>John Douglas was born at Park Cottage, <a href="Sandiway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandiway</a>, <a href="Cheshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheshire</a>, on 11 April 1830 and baptised on 16 May 1830 at <a href="St_Mary&#39;s_Church,_Weaverham" title="wikilink">St Mary's Church, Weaverham</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was the second of the four children, and the only son, of John Douglas and his wife Mary n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Swindley (1792–1863). John Douglas senior was born in <a href="Northampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northampton</a> about 1798–1800 and his wife was born in <a href="Aldford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldford</a>, a village on the <a href="Eaton_Hall,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Eaton</a> estate in Cheshire; her father was the village <a href="blacksmith" class="uri" title="wikilink">blacksmith</a> at <a href="Eccleston,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Eccleston</a>, another village in the Eaton estate. John Douglas senior was by trade a builder and <a href="joiner" class="uri" title="wikilink">joiner</a>, and also described himself as a <a href="Construction_surveying" title="wikilink">surveyor</a> and a timber merchant. In 1835 he acted as architect for a house at <a href="Hartford,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Hartford</a>, a village between Sandiway and <a href="Northwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northwich</a>. At the time of the <a href="United_Kingdom_Census_1851" title="wikilink">1851 census</a> he was employing 48 men. He owned land in Sandiway, and a house and land in the neighbouring village of <a href="Cuddington,_Vale_Royal" title="wikilink">Cuddington</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Nothing is known of John Douglas junior's school education. He gained knowledge and experience in his father's building yard and workshop which were attached to the family house. In the mid or late 1840s he was <a href="Articled_clerk" title="wikilink">articled</a> to <a href="Edward_Graham_Paley" title="wikilink">E. G. Paley</a>, of <a href="Sharpe,_Paley_and_Austin" title="wikilink">Sharpe and Paley</a>, architects in <a href="Lancaster,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a>, <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>. When his articles were completed, Douglas became Paley's chief assistant. In either 1855 or 1860 he established his own office at No. 6 Abbey Square, Chester.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="family-and-personal-life">Family and personal life</h3>
<p><embed src="Walmoor_Hill_1.jpg&lt;U+200E&gt;" title="fig:Walmoor Hill, the house Douglas built for himself" /> Douglas' elder sister, Elizabeth, was born in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's daughter from <a href="Bangor-on-Dee" title="wikilink">Bangor-is-y-Coed</a>, <a href="Flintshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flintshire</a>, on 25 January 1860 at the church in that village which he was to later restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6 Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No. 4. Their five children were born in these houses, John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. Only two of the children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from <a href="scarlet_fever" title="wikilink">scarlet fever</a> in 1868, Jerome lived for only a few days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>About 1876 the family moved to live at 33 Dee Banks, <a href="Great_Boughton" title="wikilink">Great Boughton</a>, Chester, one of a pair of semi-detached houses overlooking the <a href="River_Dee,_Wales" title="wikilink">River Dee</a>, which were built by Douglas. His wife died in 1878 from <a href="laryngitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">laryngitis</a> after a year's illness. Douglas did not remarry. His son Colin trained as an architect and worked in Douglas' office but died in 1887 at the age of 23 from <a href="Tuberculosis" title="wikilink">consumption</a>. His other son Sholto is not known to have had any profession but he was a heavy drinker of alcohol. During the 1890s Douglas built a large house for himself, <a href="Walmoor_Hill" title="wikilink">Walmoor Hill</a>, also at Dee Banks overlooking the river. Here he lived until his death on 23 May 1911 at the age of 81. His funeral was held at Overleigh old cemetery, Chester, where he was buried. The following Sunday a memorial service was held at <a href="St_John_the_Evangelist&#39;s_Church,_Sandiway" title="wikilink">St John the Evangelist's Church, Sandiway</a>. His <a href="Estate_(law)" title="wikilink">estate</a> amounted to a little over &lt;U+00A3&gt;32,000 (&lt;U+00A3&gt; today).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Apart from his surviving buildings, only two memorials remain to his memory. One is a tablet in <a href="St_Paul&#39;s_Church,_Boughton" title="wikilink">St Paul's Church, Boughton</a>, the church in which he worshipped and which he had rebuilt.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The other is a plaque placed on one of his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester, in 1923 by his pupils and assistants.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="practice-and-personality">Practice and personality</h2>
<p>Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas &amp; Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas' office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a> where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas &amp; Minshull. During the 1900s, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull &amp; Muspratt.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Little is known about Douglas' private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a <a href="Briefcase" title="wikilink">portfolio</a> and an <a href="Hearing_aid" title="wikilink">ear trumpet</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> According to architectural historian <a href="Edward_Hubbard" title="wikilink">Edward Hubbard</a>, Douglas' life &quot;seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture ... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His obituary in the <em><a href="Chester_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Chester Chronicle</a></em> stated that he &quot;lived heart and soul in his profession&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, <a href="St_Paul&#39;s_Church,_Boughton" title="wikilink">St Paul's Church, Boughton</a>, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an <a href="Oratory_(worship)" title="wikilink">oratory</a>. He also had a &quot;strong sense of national loyalty&quot;, incorporating statues of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> in <a href="Niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niches</a> at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Douglas was not good at handling the financial matters of his practice. The <a href="Hugh_Grosvenor,_1st_Duke_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Duke of Westminster's</a> secretary wrote of him in 1884, &quot;A good architect but a poor hand at accounts!&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Delay in presenting his accounts often led to difficulties and confusion; such delay sometimes amounted to as much as ten years.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Otherwise very little is known about his personal life. No family papers have survived and none of the documents from the office at 6 Abbey Square has been found.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="output-and-patronage">Output and patronage</h3>
<p>Douglas designed some 500 buildings.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He built at least 40 new churches or chapels, restored, altered or made additions to many other churches, and designed fittings and furniture for the interiors of churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas' works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an <a href="obelisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">obelisk</a>, cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further afield, in <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a>, <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> and Scotland.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="Vale-Royal-Abbey-Douglas.jpg" title="fig:Vale Royal Abbey showing the part of the south wing added by Douglas" alt="Vale Royal Abbey showing the part of the south wing added by Douglas" /> Throughout his career Douglas attracted commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, which is no longer in existence, for the garden of the Honourable Mrs Cholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of <a href="Hugh_Cholmondeley,_2nd_Baron_Delamere" title="wikilink">Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere</a>, and it was from the 2nd Baron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at <a href="Vale_Royal_Abbey" title="wikilink">Vale Royal Abbey</a> in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of <a href="St_John_the_Evangelist&#39;s_Church,_Winsford" title="wikilink">St John the Evangelist</a> at <a href="Over,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Over</a>, <a href="Winsford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winsford</a>, as a memorial to his first wife.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Douglas' most important patrons were the <a href="Duke_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Grosvenor</a> family of <a href="Eaton_Hall,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Eaton Hall</a>, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned to design the entrance lodge and other structures for <a href="Grosvenor_Park,_Chester" title="wikilink">Grosvenor Park</a> in Chester, and <a href="St_John_the_Baptist&#39;s_Church,_Aldford" title="wikilink">St John's Church</a> in the village of Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for <a href="Richard_Grosvenor,_2nd_Marquess_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son <a href="Hugh_Grosvenor,_1st_Duke_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the <a href="Hugh_Grosvenor,_2nd_Duke_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">2nd Duke</a>, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1st Duke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15 schools, around 50 farms (in whole or in part), about 300 cottages, lodges and <a href="Forge" title="wikilink">smithies</a>, two factories, two inns and about 12 commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's <a href="Halkyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halkyn</a> estate in <a href="Flintshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flintshire</a>, including another church.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Other wealthy landowners who commissioned work from Douglas included <a href="William_Molyneux,_4th_Earl_of_Sefton" title="wikilink">William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton</a>, <a href="Francis_Egerton,_3rd_Earl_of_Ellesmere" title="wikilink">Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere</a>, <a href="George_Cholmondeley,_5th_Marquess_of_Cholmondeley" title="wikilink">George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley</a>, <a href="Rowland_Egerton-Warburton" title="wikilink">Rowland Egerton-Warburton</a> of <a href="Arley_Hall" title="wikilink">Arley Hall</a>, Cheshire, and in Wales, the family of <a href="Baron_Kenyon" title="wikilink">Lord Kenyon</a>, and the Gladstone family, including <a href="William_Gladstone" title="wikilink">W.

<p><img src="St_John&#39;s_Church,_Over.jpg" title="fig:St John&#39;s Church, Over" alt="St John&#39;s Church, Over" /> Although the firm where Douglas received his training was in a provincial city in the north of England, it was at the forefront of the <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival</a> in the country. The Gothic Revival was a reaction against the <a href="neoclassical_architecture" title="wikilink">neoclassical</a> style, which had been popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and it incorporated features of the <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> style of the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Both <a href="Edmund_Sharpe" title="wikilink">Edmund Sharpe</a> and E.

W. N Pugin</a> who believed that &quot;Gothic was the only correct and Christian way to build&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Sharpe had also been influenced by <a href="Thomas_Rickman" title="wikilink">Thomas Rickman</a>, and he had written papers on medieval scholarship himself. Paley had been influenced by his brother, <a href="Frederick_Apthorp_Paley" title="wikilink">Frederick Apthorp Paley</a>, who was enthusiastic about Gothic architecture, and who had also been influenced by Rickman.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During the time Douglas was working in Lancaster the firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in Gothic Revival style, one of which was <a href="St_Wilfrid&#39;s_Church,_Davenham" title="wikilink">St Wilfrid's Church</a> in the Cheshire village of <a href="Davenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Davenham</a>, some  from Sandiway.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Douglas' first church, that of <a href="St_John_the_Evangelist&#39;s_Church,_Winsford" title="wikilink">St John the Evangelist</a> at <a href="Over,_Cheshire" title="wikilink">Over</a>, <a href="Winsford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winsford</a>, was entirely <a href="English_Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">English Gothic</a> in style, more specifically <a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Decorated_Gothic" title="wikilink">Early Decorated</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Douglas' influences were not from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what has come to be known as the <a href="Victorian_Gothic" title="wikilink">High Victorian</a> style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently <a href="Hip_roof" title="wikilink">hipped</a>, round <a href="turret" title="wikilink">turrets</a> with conical roofs, <a href="pinnacle" title="wikilink">pinnacles</a>, heavy <a href="corbel#Corbal_tables" title="wikilink">corbel tables</a>, and the use of <a href="Polychrome" title="wikilink">polychromism</a>. Many of Douglas' works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> One characteristic feature of Douglas' work is the inclusion of <a href="Dormer" title="wikilink">dormer windows</a> rising through the <a href="eaves" class="uri" title="wikilink">eaves</a> and surmounted by hipped roofs.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <img src="Grosvenor_Park_Lodge.jpg" title="fig:Grosvenor Park Lodge" alt="Grosvenor Park Lodge" /> Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in <a href="vernacular_architecture" title="wikilink">vernacular architecture</a>. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using <a href="timber_framing" title="wikilink">half-timbering</a> was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been <a href="Thomas_Mainwaring_Penson" title="wikilink">Thomas Mainwaring Penson</a>, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and <a href="James_Harrison_(architect)" title="wikilink">James Harrison</a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and it came to be developed mainly by <a href="Thomas_Lockwood" title="wikilink">T. M. Lockwood</a> and by Douglas.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Part of Douglas' earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the <a href="Tudor_style_architecture" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> style. These include tile-hanging, <a href="Pargeting" title="wikilink">pargetting</a> and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects <a href="William_Eden_Nesfield" title="wikilink">Nesfield</a> and <a href="Richard_Norman_Shaw" title="wikilink">Shaw</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the <a href="Low_Countries" title="wikilink">Low Countries</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>A characteristic of Douglas' work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his <a href="joiner" title="wikilink">joinery</a>, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A further Continental influence was his use of a <a href="Dutch_gable" title="wikilink">Dutch gable</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The most important and consistently-used element in Douglas' vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and <a href="St_Michael_and_All_Angels_Church,_Altcar" title="wikilink">St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar</a>, the entire buildings were timber-framed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>
<p>Douglas published no writings of his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the <em>Abbey Square Sketch Book</em>, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17th centuries, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas' only contribution was a jointly-ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the <a href="Abbey_Gateway,_Chester" title="wikilink">Abbey Gateway, Chester</a>.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reputation-influences-and-legacy">Reputation, influences and legacy</h2>
<p>Douglas practised for the whole of his career in a provincial county town, and most of his works were concentrated in Cheshire and North Wales, yet he &quot;conducted a practice which achieved national renown&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> He was never a member of the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, but his works featured frequently in national publications, including <em>Building News</em>, <em><a href="Building_(magazine)" title="wikilink">The Builder</a></em>, <em>The Architect</em>, and <em>The British Architect</em>, the last of which particularly praised many of his works. A number of Douglas' works were exhibited at the <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> and appeared in <em>Academy Architecture</em>.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Douglas' obituary in <em>The British Architect</em> referred to him as having &quot;achieved a reputation which has long placed him in the front rank of living architects&quot;.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> In the series <em><a href="Pevsner_Architectural_Guides" title="wikilink">The Buildings of England</a></em>, <a href="Nikolaus_Pevsner" title="wikilink">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> described him, without reservation, as &quot;the best Cheshire architect&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> In the companion series <em>The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd</em>, <a href="Edward_Hubbard" title="wikilink">Hubbard</a> expressed the opinion that he was &quot;the most important and active local architect of the period&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Critical praise was not confined to Britain; Douglas' works were acclaimed by the French architect <a href="Paul_S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dille" title="wikilink">Paul S&lt;U+00E9&gt;dille</a>, and the German architect and writer <a href="Hermann_Muthesius" title="wikilink">Hermann Muthesius</a>. Despite this, the only official recognition he received in his lifetime was a medal for <a href="Abbeystead_House" title="wikilink">Abbeystead House</a>, which was shown at an exhibition in Paris.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of the architects training and working in Douglas' office were influenced by him. Perhaps the best known of these were <a href="Edmund_Kirby" title="wikilink">Edmund Kirby</a> and Edward Ould. Kirby is best remembered for his <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include <a href="Thomas_Lockwood" title="wikilink">Thomas Lockwood</a>, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>A large proportion of Douglas' buildings still exist, many of them being <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed buildings</a>, in a wide variety of types and styles. Douglas is not remembered for any one building type; his churches and houses are considered to be of equal importance. He was not a pioneer of any particular new development, but instead followed national stylistic trends while still retaining his individuality.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> His buildings are &quot;anything but copyist&quot; and they &quot;bear a highly individual and nearly always recognisable stamp&quot;.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The major characteristics of his buildings are &quot;sure proportions, imaginative massing and grouping ... immaculate detailing and a superb sense of craftsmanship and feeling for materials&quot;. His work is &quot;architecture which can be enjoyed as well as admired&quot;.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
