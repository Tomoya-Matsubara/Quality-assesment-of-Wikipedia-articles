<p><strong>Terrance Gordon &quot;Uke&quot; Sawchuk</strong> (December 28, 1929 &lt;U+2013&gt; May 31, 1970) was a <a href="Ukrainian_Canadian" title="wikilink">Ukrainian Canadian</a> <a href="professional_sports" title="wikilink">professional</a> <a href="ice_hockey" title="wikilink">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender" class="uri" title="wikilink">goaltender</a> who played 21 seasons in the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a> for the <a href="Detroit_Red_Wings" title="wikilink">Detroit Red Wings</a>, <a href="Boston_Bruins" title="wikilink">Boston Bruins</a>, <a href="Toronto_Maple_Leafs" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a> and <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="wikilink">New York Rangers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-playing-career">Early life and playing career</h2>
<p>Sawchuk was born and raised in <a href="East_Kildonan,_Winnipeg" title="wikilink">East Kildonan</a>, a working-class, Ukrainian section of <a href="Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="wikilink">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, Canada, the third of four sons and one adopted daughter of Louis Sawchuk, a tinsmith who had come to Canada as a boy from the <a href="Austria" title="wikilink">Austrian</a>-controlled <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, and his wife, Anne Maslak Sawchuk, a homemaker. The second son died young from scarlet fever and the oldest, an aspiring hockey goaltender whom Terry idolized, died suddenly of a heart attack at age seventeen. At age twelve, Sawchuk injured his right elbow playing football and, not wanting to be punished by his parents, hid the injury, preventing the dislocation from properly healing. Thus, the arm was left with limited mobility and several inches shorter than the left, and bothered him for his entire athletic career. After inheriting his older brother's goalie equipment, Sawchuk began playing ice hockey in a local league and worked for a sheet-metal company installing vents over bakery ovens. His goaltending talent was so evident that at age fourteen a local scout for the <a href="Detroit_Red_Wings" title="wikilink">Detroit Red Wings</a> had him work out with the team, who later signed him to an amateur contract and sent him to play for their junior team in <a href="Galt,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Galt, Ontario</a>, in 1946, where he also finished the eleventh grade but most likely did not graduate from high school. The Red Wings signed him to a professional contract in 1947, and he quickly progressed through their developmental system, winning honors as the <a href="Rookie_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Rookie of the Year</a> in both the U.S. and American Hockey Leagues. Sawchuk also capably filled in for seven games when the Detroit goalie <a href="Harry_Lumley" title="wikilink">Harry Lumley</a> was injured in January 1950. Sawchuk showed such promise that the Red Wings traded Lumley to the <a href="Chicago_Black_Hawks" title="wikilink">Chicago Black Hawks</a>, even though he had just led the team to the 1949&lt;U+2013&gt;1950 <a href="Stanley_Cup" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup</a>. Nicknamed &quot;Ukey&quot; or &quot;The Uke&quot; by his teammates because of his <a href="Ukrainian_Canadian" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a> ancestry, Sawchuk led the Red Wings to three Stanley Cups in five years, winning the <a href="Calder_Trophy" title="wikilink">Calder Trophy</a> as the top <a href="rookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">rookie</a> (the first to win such honors in all three professional hockey leagues) and three <a href="Vezina_Trophies" title="wikilink">Vezina Trophies</a> for the fewest goals allowed (he missed out the other two years by one goal). He was selected as an All-Star five times in his first five years in the NHL, had an astounding fifty-six shutouts, and his goals-against average (GAA) remained under 2.00. In the 1951&lt;U+2013&gt;1952 playoffs the Red Wings swept both the Black Hawks and the <a href="Montreal_Canadiens" title="wikilink">Montreal Canadiens</a>, with Sawchuk surrendering just five goals in eight games (for a minuscule 0.67 GAA), with four shutouts.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The chubby Sawchuk was ordered by Detroit general manager Jack Adams to lose weight before the 1951&lt;U+2013&gt;1952 season, and his personality seemed to change when he dropped more than forty pounds, becoming sullen and withdrawn. He became increasingly surly with reporters and fans, and preferred doing crossword puzzles to giving interviews, and struggled for years to regain the weight. Also contributing to his moodiness and self-doubt was the pressure of playing day in and day out despite repeated injuries &lt;U+2014&gt; there were no backup goaltenders. He frequently played through pain, and during his career he had three operations on his right elbow, an appendectomy, countless cuts and bruises, a broken instep, a collapsed lung, ruptured discs in his back, and severed tendons in his hand. Years of crouching in the net caused Sawchuk to walk with a permanent stoop and resulted in lordosis (swayback), which prevented him from sleeping for more than two hours at a time. He also received approximately 400 stitches to his face before adopting a protective facemask in 1962.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1966, <a href="Life_Magazine" title="wikilink">Life Magazine</a> had a make-up artist apply stitches and scars to Sawchuk's face to demonstrate all of the injuries to his face over the years. The make-up artist did not have enough room for everything.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The Red Wings traded Sawchuk to the <a href="Boston_Bruins" title="wikilink">Boston Bruins</a> in June 1955 because they had a capable younger goaltender in the minor leagues (<a href="Glenn_Hall" title="wikilink">Glenn Hall</a>), which devastated the self-critical goalie. During his second season with Boston, Sawchuk was diagnosed with <a href="mononucleosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">mononucleosis</a>, but returned to the team after only two weeks. Physically weak, playing poorly, and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he announced his retirement in early 1957 and was labeled a &quot;quitter&quot; by team executives and several newspapers. Detroit, however, soured on Glenn Hall's performance, so they reacquired Sawchuk by trading a young forward named <a href="Johnny_Bucyk" title="wikilink">Johnny Bucyk</a> to Boston in what is arguably one of the most one-sided trades in NHL history. But after seven seasons when they had another promising young goalie (<a href="Roger_Crozier" title="wikilink">Roger Crozier</a>) ready for promotion from the minor leagues, Detroit left Sawchuk unprotected in the intraleague waiver draft, and he was quickly claimed by the <a href="Toronto_Maple_Leafs" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. With Sawchuck sharing goaltending duties with the forty-year-old <a href="Johnny_Bower" title="wikilink">Johnny Bower</a>, the veteran duo won the 1964&lt;U+2013&gt;1965 <a href="Vezina_Trophy" title="wikilink">Vezina Trophy</a> and led Toronto to the 1966&lt;U+2013&gt;1967 Stanley Cup. Left unprotected in the June 1967 expansion draft, Sawchuk played one season for the <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a> before being traded back to Detroit. Sawchuk spent his final season with the <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="wikilink">New York Rangers</a>, where he played sparingly but recorded the final shutout of his career.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Sawchuk married Patricia Ann Bowman Morey on 6 August 1953 after a very brief courtship. They had seven children, and the family suffered for many years from Sawchuk's increasing alcoholism, philandering (a Toronto girlfriend became pregnant by him in 1967), and verbal and physical abuse. Morey threatened to divorce him numerous times, and finally did so in 1969.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p><img src="Tombstone_of_Terry_Sawchuk.jpg" title="fig:Tombstone of Terry Sawchuk, at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Pontiac, MI." alt="Tombstone of Terry Sawchuk, at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Pontiac, MI." /> Sawchuk struggled with untreated <a href="clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>, a condition that often affected his conduct. After the 1969&lt;U+2013&gt;1970 season ended, Sawchuk and Rangers teammate <a href="Ron_Stewart" title="wikilink">Ron Stewart</a>, both of whom had been drinking, argued over expenses for the house they rented together on Long Island, New York. Sawchuk suffered severe internal injuries during the scuffle from falling on top of Stewart's bent knee. At Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Sawchuk's gallbladder was removed and he had a second operation on his damaged and bleeding liver. The press described the incident as &quot;horseplay,&quot; and Sawchuk told the police that he accepted full responsibility for the events. At New York Hospital in Manhattan, another operation was performed on Sawchuk's bleeding liver. He never recovered and died shortly thereafter from a pulmonary embolism on May 31, 1970 at the age of forty. The last reporter to speak to him, a little over a week before his death, was Shirley Fischler (wife of <a href="Stan_Fischler" title="wikilink">Stan Fischler</a>), who went to see him in the hospital as a visitor, not identifying herself as a reporter. Sawchuk told her the incident with Ron Stewart &quot;was just a fluke, a complete fluke accident.&quot; Fischler described him as &quot;so pale and thin that the scars had almost disappeared from his face.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A Nassau County grand jury exonerated Stewart and ruled that Sawchuk's death was accidental. Sawchuk was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in <a href="Pontiac,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Pontiac, Michigan</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Red_Wings_retired_Banners.jpg" title="fig:Sawchuk&#39;s #1 banner hanging in Joe Louis Arena." alt="Sawchuk&#39;s #1 banner hanging in Joe Louis Arena." width="290" /> During his career, Sawchuk won 501 games (447 regular season and 54 playoff) , while recording 115 <a href="shutout" title="wikilink">shutouts</a>, (103 in the regular season and 12 in the playoffs).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Sawchuk set the standard for measuring goaltenders, and was publicly hailed as the &quot;best goalie ever&quot; by a rival general manager in 1952, during only his second season.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Sawchuk finished his hockey career with 447 wins, a record that stood for thirty years, and his career record of 103 shutouts remained unsurpassed among NHL goaltenders, until <a href="Martin_Brodeur" title="wikilink">Martin Brodeur</a> bested that mark with his 104th shut out on December 21, 2009. In 1971, Sawchuk was posthumously elected to the <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> and awarded the <a href="Lester_Patrick_Trophy" title="wikilink">Lester Patrick Trophy</a> for his contribution to hockey in the United States. The Red Wings retired his number 1 in 1994. In 1997, the book <em>Shutout: The Legend of Terry Sawchuk</em> by sports author Brian Kendall, was published. Also, the book <em>Sawchuk: The troubles and triumphs of the World's Greatest Goalie</em> was published in 1998 by David Dupis, with participation by the Sawchuk family. In 2001, he was honored with his image on a <a href="List_of_people_on_stamps_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian postage stamp</a>, even though he had become a U.S. citizen in 1959. In 2008, <em>Night Work: The Sawchuk Poems,</em> a book of poetry about Sawchuk by <a href="Randall_Maggs" title="wikilink">Randall Maggs</a>, was published. The Terry Sawchuk Arena in his hometown of <a href="Winnipeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a> is named in his honour.</p>
