<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<p>La Salle offers undergraduate concentrations in nearly 60 academic areas within its College of Professional and Continuing Studies and its three Schools: Arts &amp; Sciences, Business Administration, and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Communication,Nursing, and Education are the largest majors at La Salle.</p>
<p>Several new and distinctive high-tech majors include Integrated Science, Business and Technology (ISBT) and Digital Arts and Multimedia Design (DArt). The College of Professional and Continuing Studies offers three accelerated cohort programs in Business Administration, Corporate Communication, and Organizational Leadership.</p>
<p>The university also offers <a href="master&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">master's degrees</a> and <a href="doctorate" class="uri" title="wikilink">doctorate</a> degrees in several courses of study. Every undergraduate, regardless of school or major, must complete a strict Core curriculum in order to <a href="Graduation" title="wikilink">graduate</a>. Offering sustained study in a broad range of disciplines, the Core curriculum provides students with an opportunity to build a strong educational foundation for the future. Guided by La Salle's heritage as a Catholic university, the core curriculum reflects La Salle's strong commitment to the interdependence of intellectual and spiritual growth. Its aim is to help students find an engaging living as part of an engaged life. As future competitors in a rapidly re-forming world, students need intellectual resources that keep pace with current innovations; as future innovators, students need spiritual resources that guide human beings towards humane reforms.</p>
<p>Undergraduates must complete the three facets of the <strong>Special Core Programs</strong>, as well as courses within the three <strong>Course Objectives</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="special-core-programs">Special Core Programs</h3>
<p>The <strong>Special Core Programs</strong> consists of the <em>Doubles Program</em>, <em>First Year Odyssey</em>, and <em>Understanding at Home and Abroad</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <em>Doubles Program</em>, all students are required to enroll in a &quot;Double&quot; during their freshman year. Doubles are thematically linked Core courses in different disciplines. In the Doubles program, students will explore some or all of the topics in these courses under the guidance of two professors. A sense of academic and social community forms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <em>First Year Odyssey</em> is a one-credit program, which introduces students to La Salle University and the city of Philadelphia through activities such as field trips and campus wide programs. Students participate in the First Year Odyssey as part of designated courses or in special First Year Odyssey sections.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Understanding at Home and Abroad</em> refers to fostering the Christian Brothers' ideals of community, social justice, and compassionate understanding across barriers dividing human beings. Students are required to enroll in one course in the Academic Bulletin designated by the symbol of a &quot;house&quot; (Understanding at Home) and one course designated by the symbol of a &quot;plane&quot; (Understanding Abroad). Some students may fulfill the Understanding at Home or Understanding Abroad requirement through an independent project with the approval of the Department Chair and the Core Director. Faculty and staff will mentor a limited number of such projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>
<p>The <strong>Course Objectives</strong> consist of the <em>Powers</em>, <em>Frameworks of Scientific Understanding</em>, and <em>Patterns of Meaning</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Powers</em> refers to competencies that enable students to learn, to think, and to communicate. With this course work, students will emerge from the core curriculum possessing a strong set of skills in reading, writing, oral communication, and mathematics. They will also learn how to use computer technology to aid their work in each of these areas. These competencies will be integrated in courses in all areas of the Core, but will be taught directly in courses in writing, public speaking, mathematics, and computer science.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Frameworks of Scientific Understanding</em> refers to concepts and methods learned in courses in the natural and social sciences. In these courses students will become familiar with the scientific method and sharpen their understanding of the natural processes and the social developments, which shape the world in which we live. The &quot;Frameworks of Scientific Understanding&quot; category includes courses in economics, political science, psychology, sociology, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Patterns of Meaning</em> refers to a set of capacities students must acquire to engage the moral, aesthetic, and spiritual significance of human events and achievements. Courses in the humanities (religion, philosophy, literature, history, fine arts and foreign languages) will enable students to develop these capacities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h3>
<p>All courses in the core may be counted towards any minor or major barring exclusions by the academic departments sponsoring the minor or major. To complete the Core requirements, most School of Arts and Sciences majors must complete a maximum of 19 courses; School of Business Administration majors, a maximum of 16 courses; and School of Nursing &amp; Health Sciences majors, a maximum of 15 courses.</p>

<h4 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h4>
<p>'''Learning, Involvement, Community, Relationships '''</p>

<h2 id="expansion-and-master-plan">Expansion and Master Plan</h2>
<p><img src="lasmaster.jpg" title="fig:La Salle&#39;s Master Plan|300px|right|thumb" alt="La Salle&#39;s Master Plan|300px|right|thumb" /> La Salle has worked with Philadelphia architecture firm H2L2 to assist in the development of a Campus Facilities Master Plan, building upon a previous plan completed by the University in 1985. Key components of the Master Plan are the following: New Science and Technology Building, New Athletic Arena, Student Recreation Center, additional student housing, Dining Hall (completed), Chapel, Fine Arts and Theater Building, parking garage, and additional commercial activity.</p>
<p>Accommodating the above facilities while orchestrating seamless connections between the disparate areas of the campus is one of the Plan's greatest accomplishments. Topography, city streets, and heavy traffic, all initially appeared as impediments to the development of a true campus. Improved vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns now yield enhanced links to memorable spaces, uniting this Campus into one whole, while satisfying all programmatic requirements.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2005, the $26 million dollar first phase of this master plan was completed with the construction of Tree Tops Cafe (dining hall) and St. Basil Court (Residence Hall).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>St. Basil's houses approximately 430 students. Three of the building's wings feature &quot;suites&quot;, in which four students share two bedrooms and one bathroom. The fourth wing's rooms have the traditional one-room for housing two students with communal bathrooms. The facilities have lounges, study rooms, and special purpose rooms. Basil is the only co-educational dorm at La Salle in which both genders may live on the same floor (albeit not in the same room).</p>
<p>A $2.5 million dollar athletic field renovation was completed in the Fall of 2006.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Phase two is the completion of the New Science and Technology Building. The University has revealed that they have already raised $20 million dollars towards the $25 million necessary to complete the facility <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/advancement/sh2sh/">1</a>. Scheduled completion is Fall 2009.</p>
<p>Currently, one other project is under construction. A $15 million dollar shopping center and supermarket complex.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2007, the university purchased adjacent Germantown Hospital for $10 million dollars. The  acquired has become &quot;West Campus&quot;, and increased the campus size by 25 percent.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
