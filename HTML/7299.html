<p>Between AD 900 and 1150, Chaco Canyon was a major center of culture for the <a href="Ancient_Pueblo_Peoples" title="wikilink">Ancient Pueblo Peoples</a>.

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Chaco Canyon lies within the <a href="San_Juan_Basin" title="wikilink">San Juan Basin</a>, atop the vast <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateau</a>, surrounded by the <a href="Chuska_Mountains" title="wikilink">Chuska Mountains</a> in the west, the <a href="San_Juan_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Juan Mountains</a> to the north, and the <a href="San_Pedro_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Pedro Mountains</a> in the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a>, <a href="pinyon_pine" title="wikilink">pi&lt;U+00F1&gt;on</a>, <a href="Ponderosa_Pine" title="wikilink">ponderosa pine</a>, and <a href="juniper" class="uri" title="wikilink">juniper</a> to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, runs in a roughly northwest-to-southeast direction and is rimmed by flat massifs known as <em><a href="mesa" title="wikilink">mesas</a></em>. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces&lt;U+2014&gt;side canyons known as <em>rincons</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;were critical in funneling rain-bearing storms into the canyon and boosting local precipitation levels.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The principal Chacoan complexes, such as <a href="Pueblo_Bonito" title="wikilink">Pueblo Bonito</a>, <a href="Nuevo_Alto" title="wikilink">Nuevo Alto</a>, and <a href="Kin_Kletso" title="wikilink">Kin Kletso</a>, have elevations of .</p>
<p>The <a href="alluvium" title="wikilink">alluvial</a> canyon floor slopes downward to the northeast at a gentle grade of  per mile (6 meters per kilometer); it is bisected by the <a href="Chaco_Wash" title="wikilink">Chaco Wash</a>, an <em><a href="arroyo_(creek)" title="wikilink">arroyo</a></em> that rarely bears water. Of the canyon's <a href="aquifer" title="wikilink">aquifers</a>, the largest are located at a depth that precluded ancient Chacoans from drawing groundwater: only several smaller, shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Aside from occasional storm runoff coursing through arroyos, significant surface water is virtually non-existent.</p>

A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As the Chaco Wash flowed across the upper strata of what is now the  <a href="Chacra_Mesa" title="wikilink">Chacra Mesa</a>, it cut into it, gouging out a broad canyon over the course of millions of years. The mesa comprises <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a> and <a href="shale" class="uri" title="wikilink">shale</a> formations dating from the <a href="Late_Cretaceous" title="wikilink">Late Cretaceous</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> which are of the <a href="geologic_formation" title="wikilink">Mesa Verde formation</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The canyon bottomlands were further eroded, exposing <a href="Menefee_Shale" title="wikilink">Menefee Shale</a> <a href="bedrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">bedrock</a>; this was subsequently buried under roughly  of <a href="sediment" class="uri" title="wikilink">sediment</a>. The canyon and mesa lie within the &quot;Chaco Core&quot;, distinct from the wider Chaco Plateau, the latter a flat region of grassland with infrequent stands of trees. Because the <a href="Continental_Divide" title="wikilink">Continental Divide</a> is only  east of the canyon, geological characteristics and different patterns of drainage differentiate these two regions both from each other and from the nearby <a href="Chaco_Slope" title="wikilink">Chaco Slope</a>, the <a href="Gobernador_Slope" title="wikilink">Gobernador Slope</a>, and the <a href="Chuska_Valley" title="wikilink">Chuska Valley</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

Chaco Canyon lies on the leeward side of extensive mountain ranges to the south and west, resulting in a <a href="rainshadow" class="uri" title="wikilink">rainshadow</a> effect fostering the prevailing lack of moisture in the region.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Four distinct seasons define the region, with rainfall most likely between July and September; May and June are the driest months. <a href="Orographic_precipitation" title="wikilink">Orographic precipitation</a>, resulting from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most precipitation in both summer and winter; rainfall increases with higher elevation.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Occasional abnormal northward excursions of the <a href="intertropical_convergence_zone" title="wikilink">intertropical convergence zone</a> may boost precipitation in some years.</p>

<h2 id="flora-and-fauna">Flora and fauna</h2>
<p>Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: <a href="Artemisia_tridentata" title="wikilink">sagebrush</a> and several species of <a href="cactus" class="uri" title="wikilink">cactus</a> are interspersed with dry scrub forests of <a href="Pinyon_pine" title="wikilink">pi&lt;U+00F1&gt;on</a> and <a href="juniper" class="uri" title="wikilink">juniper</a>, the latter primarily on mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the <a href="temperate_coniferous_forests" title="wikilink">temperate coniferous forests</a> plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It has been suggested that even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The canyon's most notable <a href="mammal" title="wikilink">mammalian</a> species include the ubiquitous <a href="coyote" class="uri" title="wikilink">coyote</a> (<em>Canis latrans</em>); <a href="mule_deer" title="wikilink">mule deer</a>, <a href="elk" class="uri" title="wikilink">elk</a>, and <a href="pronghorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">pronghorn</a> also live within the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller <a href="carnivore" title="wikilink">carnivores</a> include <a href="bobcat" title="wikilink">bobcats</a>, <a href="badger" title="wikilink">badgers</a>, <a href="fox" title="wikilink">foxes</a>, and two species of <a href="skunk" class="uri" title="wikilink">skunk</a>. The park hosts abundant populations of <a href="rodent" title="wikilink">rodents</a>, including several <a href="prairie_dog" title="wikilink">prairie dog</a> towns. Small colonies of <a href="bat" title="wikilink">bats</a>, are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include <a href="Geococcyx" title="wikilink">roadrunners</a>, large <a href="hawk" title="wikilink">hawks</a> (such as <a href="Cooper&#39;s_hawk" title="wikilink">Cooper's hawks</a> and <a href="American_kestrel" title="wikilink">American kestrels</a>), <a href="owl" title="wikilink">owls</a>, <a href="vulture" title="wikilink">vultures</a>, and <a href="raven" title="wikilink">ravens</a>, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east.

Three species of <a href="hummingbird" title="wikilink">hummingbirds</a> are present, including the tiny, but highly pugnacious, <a href="rufous_hummingbird" title="wikilink">rufous hummingbird</a>; they compete intensely with the more mild-tempered <a href="black-chinned_hummingbird" title="wikilink">black-chinned hummingbirds</a> for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. <a href="Crotalus_oreganus" title="wikilink">Western (prairie) rattlesnakes</a> are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various <a href="lizard" title="wikilink">lizards</a> and <a href="skink" title="wikilink">skinks</a> are far more abundant.</p>

<h3 id="ancestral-puebloans">Ancestral Puebloans</h3>
<p>The first people in the <a href="San_Juan_Basin" title="wikilink">San Juan Basin</a> were hunter-gatherers: the <em><a href="Pecos_Classification" title="wikilink">Archaic</a></em>. These small bands descended from nomadic <a href="Clovis_culture" title="wikilink">Clovis</a> big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> By 900 BC, Archaic people lived at Atlatl Cave and like sites.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> They left little evidence of their presence in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, called the <em><a href="Pecos_Classification" title="wikilink">Basketmakers</a></em> by archaeologists, farmed lands around Shabik'eshchee Village and other <a href="dugout_(shelter)" title="wikilink">pithouse</a> settlements at Chaco.</p>
<p>A small population of Basketmakers remained in the Chaco Canyon area. The broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800, when they were building crescent-shaped stone complexes, each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean <em><a href="kiva" title="wikilink">kivas</a></em>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> large enclosed areas reserved for rites.

In 1971, researchers Robert Lister and James Judge established the Chaco Center, a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between the University of New Mexico and the National Park Service. A number of multi-disciplinary research projects, archaeological surveys, and limited excavations began during this time. The Chaco Center extensively surveyed the Chacoan roads, well-constructed and heavily built thoroughfares radiating from the central canyon.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The results from such research conducted at Pueblo Alto and other sites dramatically altered accepted academic interpretations of both the Chacoan culture and the Four Corners region of the American Southwest.</p>
<p>The richness of the cultural remains at park sites led to the expansion of the small National Monument into the Chaco Culture National Historical Park on December 19, 1980, when an additional  were added to the protected area. In 1987, the park was designated a <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a>. To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent <a href="Bureau_of_Land_Management" title="wikilink">Bureau of Land Management</a> and <a href="Navajo_Nation" title="wikilink">Navajo Nation</a> lands, the Park Service developed the multi-agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. These initiatives have detailed the presence of more than 2,400 archeological sites within the current park's boundaries; only a small percentage of these have been excavated.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a>, a federal agency within the <a href="U.S._Department_of_the_Interior" title="wikilink">Department of the Interior</a>; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are controlled by the <a href="Bureau_of_Land_Management" title="wikilink">Bureau of Land Management</a>. In the 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;2003 <a href="fiscal_year" title="wikilink">fiscal year</a>, the park's total annual operating budget was <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>1,434,000.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The park has a visitor center, which features the Chaco Collection Museum, an information desk, a theater, a book store, and a gift shop.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive: compound walls were dismantled or demolished, and thousands of artifacts were extracted. Starting in 1981, a new approach, informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs, stopped such intrusions. <a href="Remote_sensing" title="wikilink">Remote sensing</a>, <a href="cultural_anthropology" title="wikilink">anthropological</a> study of Indian <a href="oral_tradition" title="wikilink">oral traditions</a>, and <a href="dendrochronology" class="uri" title="wikilink">dendrochronology</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;which left Chacoan relics undisturbed&lt;U+2014&gt;were touted. In this vein, the Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee was established in 1991 to give Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in park oversight.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. &quot;Backfilling&quot;, or re-burying excavated sites with sand, is one such means.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Other measures attempt to safeguard the area's ancient ambiance and mystique: the Chaco Night Sky Program, which seeks to eliminate the impact of <a href="light_pollution" title="wikilink">light pollution</a> on the park's acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Chacoan relics outside the current park's boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for <a href="coal_mining" title="wikilink">coal mining</a> beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long Chaco Roads Project thus documented the roads, which were later protected from the proposed mining.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>The Chacoans built their complexes along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch of canyon floor, with the walls of some structures aligned cardinally and others aligned with the 18.6 year cycle of minimum and maximum moonrise and moonset. Nine Great Houses are positioned along the north side of Chaco Wash, at the base of massive sandstone mesas. Other Great Houses are found on mesa tops or in nearby washes and drainage areas. There are 14 recognized Great Houses, which are grouped below according to geographic positioning with respect to the canyon.</p>
<h3 id="central-canyon">Central canyon</h3>
<p>The central portion of the canyon contains the largest Chacoan complexes. The most studied is <a href="Pueblo_Bonito" title="wikilink">Pueblo Bonito</a>; covering almost  and comprising at least 650 rooms, it is the largest Great House; in parts of the complex, the structure was four stories high. The builders' use of core-and-veneer architecture and multi-story construction necessitated massive masonry walls up to  thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall precisely aligned to run north-south, bisecting the central plaza. A Great Kiva was placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan Great Houses. The scale of the complex, upon completion, rivaled that of the <a href="Colosseum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colosseum</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>Nearby is <a href="Pueblo_del_Arroyo" title="wikilink">Pueblo del Arroyo</a>. Founded between AD 1050 and 1075, completed in the early 12th century, it sits at a drainage outlet known as South Gap. Casa Rinconada, eloigned from other sites at Chaco. It sits to the south side of Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. Its sole kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures whatever; it did once had a  passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. <a href="Chetro_Ketl" title="wikilink">Chetro Ketl</a>, located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical D-shape of many other central complexes, but is slightly smaller. Begun between AD 1020 and 1050, its 450&lt;U+2013&gt;550 rooms shared one Great Kiva. Experts estimate that it took 29,135 man-hours to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it took the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Kin_Kletso" title="wikilink">Kin Kletso</a> (&quot;Yellow House&quot;) was a medium-sized complex located  west of Pueblo Bonito. It shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples from the northern San Juan Basin. Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains around 55 rooms, four ground-floor <em>kivas</em>, and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a <em>kiva</em> or religious center. Evidence of an <a href="obsidian" class="uri" title="wikilink">obsidian</a>-processing industry was discovered near the village, which was erected between AD 1125 and 1130.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

Its location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin; indeed, it was only  north of Tsin Kletsin, on the opposite side of the canyon. The community was the center of a bead- and <a href="turquoise" class="uri" title="wikilink">turquoise</a>-processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon; <a href="chert" class="uri" title="wikilink">chert</a> tool production was also common. Research conducted by archaeologist Tom Windes at the site suggests that only a handful of families, perhaps as few as five to twenty, actually lived in the complex; this may imply that Pueblo Alto served a primarily non-residential role.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Another Great House, <a href="Nuevo_Alto" title="wikilink">Nuevo Alto</a>, was built on the north mesa near Pueblo Alto; it was founded in the late 12th century, a time when the Chacoan population was declining in the canyon.</p>
<h3 id="outliers">Outliers</h3>
<p>In Chaco Canyon's northern reaches lies another cluster of Great Houses; among the largest are <a href="Casa_Chiquita" title="wikilink">Casa Chiquita</a> (&quot;Small House&quot;), a village built in the AD 1080s, when, in a period of ample rainfall, Chacoan culture was expanding.

Two miles down the canyon is <a href="Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;asco_Blanco" title="wikilink">Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;asco Blanco</a> (&quot;White Bluff&quot;), an arc-shaped compound built atop the canyon's southern rim in five distinct stages between AD 900 and 1125.

<p>Immense complexes known as &quot;Great Houses&quot; embodied worship at Chaco. The Chacoan people used masonry techniques unique for their time, and their building constructions lasted decades and even centuries. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Anasazi works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.</p>

<p>Ceremonial structures known as <em><a href="kiva" title="wikilink">kivas</a></em> were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small <em>kiva</em> was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, each up to  in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone <a href="lintel" title="wikilink">lintels</a> marked all Chacoan kivas. Though simple and compound walls were often used, Great Houses were primarily constructed of <a href="core-and-veneer" class="uri" title="wikilink">core-and-veneer</a> walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a> blocks bound in <a href="clay" class="uri" title="wikilink">clay</a> mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with <a href="rubble" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubble</a>, forming the wall's core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding <a href="mud" class="uri" title="wikilink">mud</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled&lt;U+2014&gt;on foot&lt;U+2014&gt;from mountain ranges up to  away.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>The meticulously designed buildings composing the larger Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers have concluded that the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the Great Houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures in the canyon.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Around this time, the extended Ancestral Puebloan (<a href="Anasazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anasazi</a>) community experienced a population and construction boom. Throughout the 10th century, Chacoan building techniques spread from the canyon to neighboring regions.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> By AD 1115, at least 70 outlying pueblos of Chacoan provenance had been built within the  composing the San Juan Basin. Experts speculate the function of these compounds, some large enough to be considered Great Houses in their own right. Some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities, perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Thirty such outliers spread across  are connected to the central canyon and to one another by an enigmatic web of six Chacoan road systems. Extending up to  in generally straight routes, they appear to have been extensively surveyed and engineered.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Their depressed and scraped <a href="caliche_(mineral)" title="wikilink">caliche</a> beds reach  wide; earthen <a href="berm" title="wikilink">berms</a> or rocks, at times composing low walls, delimit their edges.
