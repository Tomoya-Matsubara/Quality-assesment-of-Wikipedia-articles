<p>With the outbreak of the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a> he joined the <a href="Serbian_Army" title="wikilink">Serbian Army</a> and was wounded while fighting in the village of Strevica. During the <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a>, he joined a Serbian volunteer detachment and fought at the <a href="Battle_of_Bregalnica" title="wikilink">Battle of Bregalnica</a>.

<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Jovan Stojkovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was born in the village of Martolci, near <a href="Veles_(city)" title="wikilink">Veles</a> on 25 December 1878. Some sources state that he was born in 1875. In his youth he earned the nickname &quot;Babunski&quot;, derived from the name of Mount Babuna near which his birthplace was located. He began his education at age ten, attending what was the only <a href="Bulgarian_language" title="wikilink">Bulgarian</a>-language elementary school in Veles at the time. It was here that his teacher <a href="Bulgarisation" title="wikilink">Bulgarianized</a> his name into &quot;Ivan Stojkov&quot;. Displeased, Babunski's father responded by taking his son to the Serbian <a href="consulate" class="uri" title="wikilink">consulate</a> in <a href="Skopje" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skopje</a>, from where he was taken to continue his education in <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>. After studying in Belgrade, <a href="Valjevo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valjevo</a> and <a href="Ni&lt;U+0161&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ni&lt;U+0161&gt;</a>, Babunski worked as a <a href="Serbian_language" title="wikilink">Serbian</a>-language teacher in the towns of <a href="Tetovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetovo</a> and Veles in the <a href="Azot_(region)" title="wikilink">Azot</a> region.</p>
<h2 id="guerrilla-activities">Guerrilla activities</h2>
<p>In 1905, Babunski's brother and nephew were killed by the <a href="Internal_Macedonian_Revolutionary_Organization" title="wikilink">Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization</a> (IMRO). Seeking revenge, he joined the Chetnik band of <a href="Gligor_Sokolovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Gligor Sokolovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> and <a href="Temeljko_Barjaktrevi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Temeljko Barjaktrevi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. That year, he became a Chetnik commander (). Afterwards, he defended the right bank of the <a href="Vardar_River" title="wikilink">Vardar River</a> against Bulgarian insurgents and protected persecuted Serb villages against Bulgarian and Ottoman attack. Through these actions, Babunski became one of the five leading Serbian guerilla chiefs in <a href="Macedonia_(region)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>. In 1907, the Chetnik song &quot;The Serb Trumpet Plays For Me&quot; () was composed in his honour following his successful command of Chetnik forces during an attack against a group of IMRO militants commanded by Stevan Dimitrov. With the <a href="Young_Turk_Revolution" title="wikilink">Young Turk Revolution</a> in 1908, Ottoman authorities declared a ceasefire between their forces and those of the Chetniks. Babunski left Chetnik ranks and returned to civilian life. He was later arrested by Ottoman authorities but quickly escaped from prison. That year, he returned to the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a>.</p>

During the <a href="Second_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">Second Balkan War</a>, he fought with a Serbian volunteer detachment at the <a href="Battle_of_Bregalnica" title="wikilink">Battle of Bregalnica</a>. With the outbreak of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> Babunski formed the <a href="Sava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sava</a> Chetnik detachment, which was then placed under the command of Major <a href="Vojislav_Tankosi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Vojislav Tankosi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. The unit went on to fight the <a href="Austro-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarians</a> in the late summer of 1914 and later destroyed a railway bridge on the Sava River to prevent Austro-Hungarian forces from crossing it. In 1915, Babunski and his men returned to Macedonia and fought Bulgarian guerillas. That autumn Babunski and his Chetniks were assigned to the town of <a href="Ka&lt;U+010D&gt;anik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ka&lt;U+010D&gt;anik</a>, where they joined other Serbian forces in fighting a Bulgarian division that they managed to hold to a standstill for nearly a month despite suffering heavy losses. With the <a href="Serbian_army&#39;s_retreat_through_Albania" title="wikilink">Serbian army's retreat through Albania</a> that winter, Babunski and his men withdrew to the Greek island of <a href="Corfu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corfu</a>. They then joined Serb forces at the <a href="Salonika_Front" title="wikilink">Salonika Front</a>. Here, Babunski was assigned to the Serbian <a href="First_Army_(Serbia)" title="wikilink">First Army</a> and was involved in guarding <a href="Lake_Prespa" title="wikilink">Lake Prespa</a> from the Bulgarians. Later, he and his Chetnik detachments participated in capturing enemy soldiers and gathering intelligence from the front. In 1917, French General <a href="Louis_Franchet_d&#39;Esp&lt;U+00E8&gt;rey" title="wikilink">Louis Franchet d'Esp&lt;U+00E8&gt;rey</a> awarded Babunski a medal following the capture of two German <a href="midget_submarine" title="wikilink">midget submarines</a> and their crews by him and his men. Babunski was also a recipient of the <a href="Order_of_the_Star_of_Kara&lt;U+0111&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;e" title="wikilink">Order of the Star of Kara&lt;U+0111&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;e</a>.</p>
<h2 id="post-war">Post-war</h2>
<p>After the war, Babunski was given command over a force of 250 men who helped Serb authorities suppress resistance in the towns of <a href="Bitola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bitola</a> and <a href="Tikve&lt;U+0161&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tikve&lt;U+0161&gt;</a>. During this time, forces under his command committed several atrocities in both Macedonia and Albania. Several further atrocities were carried out in <a href="Bregalnica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bregalnica</a> and Tikve&lt;U+0161&gt; and targeted local leaders sympathetic to Bulgarian <em><a href="Komitadji" title="wikilink">komitas</a></em>. Chetnik bands, including those of Babunski, enslaved locals and turned them into forced labourers for the armed forces of the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>. By the summer of 1919, Serbian and Yugoslav authorities decided that Chetnik bands such as those of Babunski were not &quot;furthering the state's aims in the region.&quot; The armed forces were then deployed to maintain order in the southern territories of the state and more than 50,000 Serbian professional soldiers were sent to <a href="Kosovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kosovo</a> and Macedonia. Babunski died in Veles on 17 February 1920, after falling from his horse and getting <a href="influenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">influenza</a>.</p>

Batakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> as &quot;exceptionally courageous and determined,&quot; Babunski is considered one of the most famous Chetnik commanders of his time. A monument dedicated to him was constructed in Veles in 1924, but it was blown up by the Bulgarians during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. A street in Belgrade bears his name.</p>
