<p><strong>Ben Stahl</strong> (1915-1998) dedicated much of his life to serving the working class globally and the people of <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> locally. After graduating from <a href="Central_High_School_(Philadelphia)" title="wikilink">Central High School</a> in 1932, he entered <a href="Temple_University" title="wikilink">Temple University</a>, studied briefly at <a href="Gratz_College" title="wikilink">Gratz College</a>, and became a leader of the <a href="Young_Peoples_Socialist_League" title="wikilink">Young Peoples Socialist League</a> before receiving his B.A. in History from Temple in 1936 (Philadelphia Inquirer 10/28/1998). Immediately after graduation he took a job as a teacher with the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">Works Progress Administration</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Workers&lt;U+2019&gt;_Education_Program" title="wikilink">Workers&lt;U+2019&gt; Education Program</a>. He joined the <a href="American_Federation_of_Teachers" title="wikilink">American Federation of Teachers</a> and became the secretary of his local before the age of 22.</p>

<p>From 1940 until 1942 he worked for the <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> Department of Public Assistance as a Social worker. He married <a href="Evelyn_Mille" title="wikilink">Evelyn Miller</a> in 1942 and in 1943 he took on the role of National Representative with the <a href="Congress_of_Industrial_Organization" title="wikilink">Congress of Industrial Organization</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s (CIO) Department of Organization. Working with the CIO to organize workers in the railroad, telephone, government, social work, brewing, jewelry, and education sectors would take him and his wife around the country from <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. Ben continued to work as a Field Organizer through the merger of the <a href="American_Federation_of_Labor" title="wikilink">American Federation of Labor</a> with the CIO in 1955 (mergers of local affiliates proceeded slowly over the next decade in Philadelphia). He and his family eventually returned to Philadelphia in 1959, where in 1962 he began the long three year fight to win the <a href="Philadelphia_Federation_of_Teachers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Federation of Teachers</a> and cafeteria workers collective bargaining rights. At victory, the new local became the largest in the state.</p>
<p>Ben Stahl worked until 1969 as a field organizer for the <a href="AFL-CIO" class="uri" title="wikilink">AFL-CIO</a>, when he became the Regional Director of the AFL-CIO&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Human_Resources_Development_Institute" title="wikilink">Human Resources Development Institute</a>. He held this position until retirement in July 1982. In 1986 Mayor <a href="Wilson_Goode" title="wikilink">Wilson Goode</a> appointed him Commissioner of the <a href="Philadelphia_Commission_on_Human_Relations" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations</a>. Throughout his working years and well into retirement he involved himself with numerous historical, labor, human rights, and civic organizations, which include:</p>
