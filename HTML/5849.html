<p><img src="Little_Tich,_1893.jpg" title="fig:Little Tich in 1893" alt="Little Tich in 1893" width="250" /> <strong>Little Tich</strong> (21 July 1867 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 February 1928),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> born <strong>Harry Relph</strong>, was a 4 foot 6 inch (137 cm) tall English <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music hall</a> comedian and dancer during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was best known for his acrobatic and comedic Big-Boot Dance, which he performed in Europe and for which he wore boots with soles 28 inches (71 cm) long. Aside from his music hall appearances, he was also a popular performer in Christmas <a href="pantomimes" class="uri" title="wikilink">pantomimes</a> and appeared in them annually at theatres throughout the English provinces. He repeated this success in London, where he appeared in three pantomimes at the <a href="Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane" title="wikilink">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> between 1891 and 1893 alongside <a href="Dan_Leno" title="wikilink">Dan Leno</a> and <a href="Marie_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Marie Lloyd</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Cudham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cudham</a>, <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>, Little Tich began performing aged ten when he developed a dance and tin-whistle act which he showcased at public houses in <a href="Sevenoaks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sevenoaks</a>. In the early 1880s he formed a <a href="blackface" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackface</a> act and gained popularity with performances at the nearby <a href="Rosherville_Gardens" title="wikilink">Rosherville Pleasure Gardens</a> and Barnard's Music Hall in <a href="Chatham,_Kent" title="wikilink">Chatham</a>. He travelled to London and appeared at the Forester's Music Hall in 1884. Later that year, he adopted the stage name &quot;Little Tich&quot;, which he based on his childhood nickname of &quot;Tichborne&quot;, acquired through his portly stature and physical likeness to the suspected <a href="Tichborne_case" title="wikilink">Tichborne Claimant</a> <a href="Arthur_Orton" title="wikilink">Arthur Orton</a>. The term &quot;titchy&quot; was later derived from &quot;Little Tich&quot;, and is used to describe things that are small.</p>
<p>Little Tich's act matured during a tour of the United States between 1887 and 1889 where he established the Big-Boot Dance and impressed audiences with his ability to stand on the tips of the shoes and to lean at extraordinary angles. In the 1890s he developed the Serpentine Dance and had a major success with the Christmas pantomime <em><a href="Babes_in_the_Wood" title="wikilink">Babes in the Wood</a></em> in <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> during the 1889&lt;U+2013&gt;90 season. In 1891, he was recruited by the <a href="impresario" class="uri" title="wikilink">impresario</a> <a href="Augustus_Harris" title="wikilink">Augustus Harris</a> to appear in that years spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas <a href="pantomime" class="uri" title="wikilink">pantomime</a> <em>Humpty Dumpty</em>. He starred in a further two productions at the theatre including <em>Little Bo Peep</em> (1892) and <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1893).</p>
<p>Between 1896 and 1902 Little Tich performed in his own musical theatre company, and spent much of his time in Paris, where he became a popular variety artist. For his music hall acts, he created characters based on everyday observations. The characterisations used were &quot;The Gas Inspector&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;ora&quot; and &quot;The Waiter&quot;; all three were later recorded onto <a href="Gramophone_record" title="wikilink">shellac</a> discs, of which he made twenty in total. He was married three times and fathered two children. In 1927 he suffered a stroke, which was partly triggered by a blow to the head which he had accidentally received during an evening performance at the <a href="Alhambra_Theatre" title="wikilink">Alhambra Theatre</a>. He never recovered fully from the injury, and died the following year at his house in <a href="Hendon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hendon</a>, aged 60.</p>

<p>Little Tich was born Harry Relph in <a href="Cudham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cudham</a>, <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> (now in the <a href="London_Borough_of_Bromley" title="wikilink">London Borough of Bromley</a>).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was the last of eight children<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> born to Richard Relph (1790&lt;U+2013&gt;1881), a farmer and publican, and his wife Mary, <a href="Married_and_maiden_names" title="wikilink"><em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em></a> Moorefield (1835&lt;U+2013&gt;1893).{{#tag:ref|Mary's maiden name was recorded as Morphew on Little Tich's birth certificate, but was Moorefield on her death certificate. It is probable that the latter is correct, with his daughter Mary Tich blaming the confusion on her grandmother's broad Irish accent being misheard by the rural Kentish <a href="General_Register_Office_for_England_and_Wales" title="wikilink">GRO</a> clerk.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>|group= n}} The Relph family were close and lived in relative affluence. Richard Relph was a committed family man and was known in the village for his sharp business acumen.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His early wealth, which was attributed to a series of successful horse-trading deals, enabled him to purchase his first public house, the Rising Sun in <a href="Fawkham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fawkham</a>. In 1818 he married Sarah Ashenden and they had eight children; she died in 1845. In 1851 he moved to Cudham, bought the Blacksmith's Arms and an adjoining farm, and started a new family with the 32-year-old Mary Moorefield, a <a href="Governess" title="wikilink">nurse-maid governess</a> from <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Little Tich was born with an <a href="polydactyly" title="wikilink">extra digit on each hand</a>, <a href="Syndactyly" title="wikilink">webbed</a> from the little finger to the centre joint. He also experienced <a href="stunted_growth" title="wikilink">stunted growth</a>. He reached 4 feet 6 inches (137 cm) in height by the age of ten, but grew no taller. His physical differences from other children caused him to become socially withdrawn and lonely.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Nevertheless, his disabilities earned him fame and were an asset to his parents' business. Patrons would travel from neighbouring counties to witness Little Tich's peculiarities, and the youngster revelled in the attention, dancing comically on the saloon bar to curious guests.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Little Tich was educated at <a href="Knockholt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knockholt</a>, a three-mile walk from Cudham. From an early age, he displayed considerable academic ability and also excelled in art; by the time he was five, his drawings were being sold to patrons of the Blacksmith's Arms by his father.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Little Tich became interested in the travelling performers whom his father often employed to entertain guests at the inn. He would mimic the dancers, singers and conjurors, causing much amusement to both his family and patrons. So good were his impersonations that his siblings frequently took him to neighbouring public houses where they would get him to perform in exchange for money. These experiences prepared Little Tich for his future career. As a result of what he saw, he like his father became a strict teetotaller in later years, showing a deep loathing for boisterous and intoxicated people. Little Tich relished his local celebrity status; however, the older he got the more self-conscious he became and wrongly interpreted the audience's laughter as being aimed more at his disabilities rather than his comical performances.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

He resumed his education, this time at Christ Church School, where he spent the next three years.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1878 the headmaster deemed him too educationally advanced for the school, and Richard Relph was advised to secure for his young son a <a href="Watchmaker" title="wikilink">watchmaking</a> apprenticeship instead; Relph ignored the advice.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1878 Little Tich's parents were unable to financially provide for him further and he sought full-time employment as a lather boy in a barber's shop in Gravesend.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> One evening, together with a friend whose brother was appearing in a talent contest, he visited a <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music hall</a> for the first time and quickly became &quot;hooked&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> on the idea of being able to perform. Thanks largely to his local celebrity status of being a &quot;freak&quot;,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> he was welcomed into the many public houses which catered for soldiers, sailors, merchant seamen and day-trippers from London.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1878, Little Tich had saved enough money to buy himself a <a href="tin_whistle" title="wikilink">tin whistle</a> which he used to &quot;amuse [him]self by playing all the jolly and sentimental <a href="pantomime" class="uri" title="wikilink">pantomime</a> songs of the day.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> To earn money, he began <a href="busking" class="uri" title="wikilink">busking</a> to local theatre goers who were waiting in the outside queues. On the way home from his busking performances, he devised eccentric dances, much to the amusement of his onlooking neighbours.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Little Tich made his stage debut as Harry Relph at the age of 12 in 1879. The venue&lt;U+2014&gt;although unidentified&lt;U+2014&gt;was described by his daughter Mary as being a &quot;back-street, free-and-easy&quot; where the acts were predominantly made up of amateurs and beginners. The audiences were often harsh and they would display their displeasure by throwing objects onto the stage.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>One evening, having exhausted the list of amateur talent, the compere called on Little Tich and his tin-whistle to take up the next turn. The performance was a success and Little Tich returned every night, often accompanying his tin-whistle piece with impromptu dance routines.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> News of his performances spread, and he was soon signed up by the proprietor of the neighbouring Royal Exchange music hall,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> who bought his new signing a pair of <a href="Clog_(shoe)" title="wikilink">clogs</a>. Little Tich became a popular draw at the hall and often sang thirty songs a night. It was here that he discovered the art of <a href="blackface" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackface</a>, a popular type of entertainment widely performed around the British Isles at that time.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Popular music hall comedians who started their career as blackface artistes include <a href="Alfred_Vance" title="wikilink">Alfred Vance</a> and <a href="Bransby_Williams" title="wikilink">Bransby Williams</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>|group= n}}</p>

Mackney (1825&lt;U+2013&gt;1909) a <a href="Morpeth,_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Morpeth</a>-born <a href="clogging" title="wikilink">clog dancer</a> and singer who excelled in the art of blackface.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>|group= n}} and graduated to the world of open air theatre. The following year, he joined a blackface troupe who performed regularly at the <a href="Rosherville_Gardens" title="wikilink">Rosherville Pleasure Gardens</a>;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> the local historian J.R.S. Clifford described them as &quot;a band of minstrel darkies of a superior type&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Little Tich's transition from amateur to professional performer came when he appeared in a weekly spot at Barnard's Music Hall in <a href="Chatham,_Kent" title="wikilink">Chatham</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Lew Barnard, the hall's proprietor, offered him 35 <a href="shilling" title="wikilink">shillings</a> a week. Thrilled at the prospect of appearing in a proper music hall, Little Tich changed his name from The Infant Mackney to Young Tichborne, a nickname he had gained while living in Cudham years earlier.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The nickname derives from the <a href="Tichborne_case" title="wikilink">Tichborne case</a> of 1854, a legal <em><a href="cause_c&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;bre" title="wikilink">cause c&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;bre</a></em> which occurred in Victorian England in the 1860s and 1870s. The claimant <a href="Arthur_Orton" title="wikilink">Arthur Orton</a> was a fat man and the name Tichborne was frequently used to describe persons who were of such stature. In his early years, Little Tich was also overweight and he became known as &quot;Young Tichborne&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> When he appeared on stage as a youth, audiences would often shout &quot;come on little Tichbourne&quot; when he was about to come onto the stage, or if he was struggling with his act. By the mid-1880s, he had lost almost all of his excess weight, but the name had stuck and it then became an ironic term of endearment owing to the giant stature of Orton, compared to the diminutive one of Little Tich.<ref name="TICH23<U+2013>24&quot; /&gt;|group= n}} He enjoyed initial success at Barnard's, but audience numbers soon diminished and his pay was reduced to 15 shillings a week as a result. To supplement his income, he resumed his position in the barber's shop and took on a string of menial jobs that lasted six months.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1881 Little Tich left home with his sister Agnes, who chaperoned her young brother around the music halls and variety clubs throughout England. By now, he had upgraded from the tin whistle and had bought a <a href="picco_pipe" title="wikilink">picco pipe</a> which he used to accompany his clog dancing routine. He despised his early experiences of provincial touring as he was often forced to sleep in <a href="Flophouse" title="wikilink">dosshouses</a> with very little money or food. To survive, he would often return to busking outside music halls to the waiting audiences.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In the early months of 1884, he secured an engagement at a rundown public house called The Dolphin in <a href="Kidderminster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kidderminster</a>, where he was paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 a week.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|&lt;U+00A3&gt;2 a week equates to &lt;U+00A3&gt; in  (adjusted for inflation).|group= n}} That year, he hired his first agent who, unbeknown to Little Tich, had advertised him as a &quot;freak&quot; and a &quot;six-fingered novelty&quot;. Little Tich was furious with the description and quickly dispensed with the agent's services.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> By the summer of that year, engagements were infrequent and the comedian used the long periods of unemployment constructively. He learned how to read and write music and taught himself to play various musical instruments including the piano, <a href="fiddle" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiddle</a> and <a href="cello" class="uri" title="wikilink">cello</a>. He also mastered dancing in big boots.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The act of dancing in oversized shoes, or &quot;big boots&quot; as they came to be known, originated from clog dancing with the outsized flat shoe being used for comic effect by &quot;nigger comedians&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>|group= n}}</p>
<p><img src="Little_Tich_in_Paris.jpg" title="fig:Little Tich midway through a performance of the Big-Boot Dance" alt="Little Tich midway through a performance of the Big-Boot Dance" width="250" /> In November 1884 he changed his stage name for the third time to Little Tich, which derived from Tichborne, and &quot;Tich&quot; or &quot;Tichy&quot; became a common term meaning small.<ref name="TICH23<U+2013>24&quot; /&gt;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Although he had only officially changed his stage name three times up until this point, he was unofficially billed with at least five others including: &quot;Young Tichborne, Pocket Mackney&quot;; &quot;Young Tichborne, Little Black Storm&quot;; &quot;Young Tichborne, The Picco Soloist&quot;; or simply &quot;Tiny Tich&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>|group= n}} His reasoning for the name change was to capitalise on the release of the Tichborne claimant fraudster <a href="Arthur_Orton" title="wikilink">Arthur Orton</a> who was then touring the British Isles in the hope of reopening the case.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The change of name also coincided with the signing of a new agent who was known in London for being &quot;one of the brightest and youngest in [show]business&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The agent, Edward Colley (1859&lt;U+2013&gt;1889),<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> was equally thrilled with the acquisition of a new star<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and secured him a double engagement at the Marylebone Music Hall where he appeared as &quot;Little Titch, The Most Curious Comique in Creation&quot; and immediately after at the Forester's Music Hall,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> where he was billed as &quot;Little Titch, the Funny Little Nigger&quot;.

<p>By Christmas 1884, Little Tich was a resident performer in four London music halls: the <a href="New_London_Theatre" title="wikilink">Middlesex Music Hall</a> where he had an 8pm billing, the Marylebone (at 9pm), the Star Palace of Varieties in <a href="Bermondsey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bermondsey</a> (at 10pm), and Crowders Music Hall in <a href="Mile_End" title="wikilink">Mile End</a> (at 11pm).

Alaska had previously worked for Little Tich as his dresser and after his death, Knoepper moved into the Relph residence in France and started his education there. After a few months of living with Little Tich, he was moved to London to stay with Julia. In later years Little Tich's daughter Mary admitted that her father treated Knoepper as more of a son than Paul, who became estranged from the family by the 1920s.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> While in Paris in 1910, Little Tich was made an officer of the <a href="Ordre_des_Palmes_Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;miques" title="wikilink">Ordre des Palmes Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;miques</a> by the French Ministry of Public Instruction for his services to the stage.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Towards the end of 1910, he travelled to Scotland to complete a short engagement at the King's Theatre in Dundee.

<p>In 1915 Little Tich cut short his engagement at the <a href="Golders_Green" title="wikilink">Golders Green</a> Hippodrome to take up a better offer in Paris. As a result, the proprietors of the Hippodrome sued for breach of contract and he had to pay them &lt;U+00A3&gt;103 in compensation.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> That year he recorded &quot;The Tallyman&quot;, &quot;The Gamekeeper&quot;, &quot;The Skylark&quot; and &quot;The Pirate&quot; onto disc<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> before heading to the northern English provinces to prepare for that year's Christmas pantomime at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool.

For the character's appearance he wore a ripped and dirty frock, a scrag wig and carried an old mop and bucket which he borrowed from home. The act required him to flip the mop up into the air and grabbing the handle before carrying on singing.
