<p>Una Troy was born in Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland in 1910. She married Dr. Joe Walsh in 1931. Her sister in law, Mai (Walsh), was the wife of renowned Irish artist Sean Keating RHA of Rathfarnham, Co. Dublin.</p>
<p>Writing under the pen name of &quot;Elizabeth Connor&quot;, she began her career in 1936 with the publication of Mount Prospect which was banned in the Irish Free State. Adapted as a play, it garnered the Shaw prize for new playwrights and was performed on the Abbey stage in 1940. Three subsequent plays were also performed at the Abbey in the 1940s. In 1938, Dead Star's Light was published. The protagonist, John Davern, was based on the character of IRA revolutionary idealist <a href="George_Lennon" title="wikilink">George Lennon</a> of West Waterford. While not banned, it did elicit censure from her Clonmel parish priest who removed Una and her husband from membership in that church. Dead Star's Light was performed on the Abbey stage in 1947 as The Dark Road.</p>
<p>Writing as Una Troy in the 1950s, her 1955 novel, We Are Seven, was adapted as a film in 1958 entitled She Didn't Say No for which she was the co-writer. The film, with its portrayal of illegitimacy, was not released in Ireland until shown in 2001 at the Irish Film Archive. In the post World War II period she wrote fifteen novels.</p>
<p>She died in 1993 in Bunmahon, County Waterford. Many of her papers, collected by Ann Butler of Cambridge, Massachusetts are to be found (&quot;Una Troy Papers&quot;) at the National Library of Ireland (www.unatroy.com).</p>
