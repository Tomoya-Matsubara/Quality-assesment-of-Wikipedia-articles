<p>is a Japanese <a href="Eroge" title="wikilink">adult</a> <a href="visual_novel" title="wikilink">visual novel</a> developed by <a href="Petit_Ferret" title="wikilink">Petit Ferret</a> with <a href="character_design" title="wikilink">character designs</a> by <a href="Akio_Watanabe" title="wikilink">Akio Watanabe</a> under the alias Poyoyon&lt;U+2661&gt;Rock. It was originally released as a <a href="Personal_computer_game" title="wikilink">PC game</a> for <a href="CD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-ROM</a> on December 13, 2002 and subsequently re-released on <a href="DVD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD-ROM</a> and for <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2 (PS2)</a> with the latter removing some of the adult content. A <a href="fan_disc" title="wikilink">fan disc</a> for <em>Popotan</em> by Petit Ferret was also released shortly before the DVD-ROM re-release.</p>
<p>The <a href="gameplay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gameplay</a> in <em>Popotan</em> follows a semi-predetermined plot; major events are the same, however, as the game progresses the storylines eventually diverges quite dramatically. The game focuses mostly on the three sisters and it is necessary to finish at least their scenarios before the player can pursue the other girls. Beyond that, the main goal is to make available <a href="Hentai" title="wikilink">sexual scenes and images</a> that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> having <a href="sexual_intercourse" title="wikilink">sexual intercourse</a> with one of the girls.</p>
<p><em>Popotan</em> has made the transition into other media as well. A <a href="novel" class="uri" title="wikilink">novel</a> series based off the visual novel entitled  by Sassami Yachiruda was published by Softgarage; the novels were released in two volumes on June 20 and August 22, 2002. On May 7, 2003 <em><a href="Magazine_Z" title="wikilink">Magazine Z</a></em> announced it would publish a <em>Popotan</em> manga series by Y&lt;U+016B&gt;jiro Izumi<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose story would revolve around the three sisters.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> There was also a twelve episode <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> directed by <a href="Shinichiro_Kimura" title="wikilink">Shinichiro Kimura</a> that originally aired on <a href="Tokyo_Broadcasting_System" title="wikilink">Tokyo Broadcasting System</a> from July 17 through October 2, 2003. The anime was licensed in North America by <a href="Geneon_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Geneon USA</a> until Geneon folded in 2008. A radio drama  was also produced between April and December 2003 and broadcast over <a href="Osaka_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Osaka Radio</a>'s and <a href="TBS_Radio_&amp;_Communications" title="wikilink">TBS Radio</a>'s networks and later put on CD. Several art and reference books were released by the franchise as well as other less notable media.</p>
<p>The title, <em>Popotan</em>, is meant to reflect the prominence of dandelions, spelled  in <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the game; &quot;Popotan&quot; is a nonsensical word and is like literally saying &quot;liondandy&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It also uses the flipped &quot;-tan&quot; to call the dandelions by name.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><img src="PopotanPo-Screenshot.png" title="fig:The game uses character position and size to show the characters&#39; relative relation to the protagonist. Ai (left) is closer while Mii (right) is off to the side of the room further away." alt="The game uses character position and size to show the characters&#39; relative relation to the protagonist. Ai (left) is closer while Mii (right) is off to the side of the room further away." /> Most of <em>Popotan</em>'s <a href="gameplay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gameplay</a> requires little interaction from the player since a majority of the time is spent reading the text that appears on the game's screen, which represents either <a href="dialogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialogue</a> between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through the text, the players will either come to a &quot;decision point&quot; where they must choose from multiple options or the text will end and the player must either move to a new location<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or, in the DVD-ROM and PS2 versions, continue on to the next event through a shortcut option.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The time between these points varies. Gameplay pauses at these points and, depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress and may branch off in a specific direction,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> though pursuing anyone beyond the three sisters requires at least one of the latter's scenarios to have been successfully completed. After completing Ai's scenario the player unlocks a new scenario with Unagi.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The PS2 port added new events and scenes to the original<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> to replace some of the content that was removed. While text is on the screen the player has the option to save the game, however, when there is none the player is unable to save on the PC versions of the game.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With the PS2 port, this limitation was removed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>At certain points along Mii's scenario a special <a href="music_video_game" title="wikilink">music mini-game</a> will commence. The goal of the <a href="mini-game" class="uri" title="wikilink">mini-game</a> is to max out &quot;Magical Girl Mii&quot;'s magical power meter by hitting balls at the right moment.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Succeeding or failing the mini-game does not have a major impact on the plot, though it does have an immediate affect upon the scene. After successfully completing Mii's scenario, an <a href="omake" class="uri" title="wikilink">omake</a> option will become available on the main menu. This allows the player to play the mini-game based upon various music tracks from the game.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Popotan</em> uses over one-thousand <a href="2D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">two-dimensional computer graphics</a> for backgrounds, events and character poses to engage the player. While only the mouths and eyes are animated, the number of poses is quite large and most minor characters were given the similar treatment as major characters,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> though with fewer major poses to cut costs.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In addition, the game regularly and actively uses a character placement on screen to display relative position of the characters in relation to the protagonist, including moving them enlarging or shrinking the images to show distance being closer or further away respectively.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="setting-and-themes">Setting and themes</h3>
<p><em>Popotan</em> takes place sometime in the distant future, though the exact location is unclear because enough <a href="geologic_time" title="wikilink">time</a> has passed to transform the area. A giant dandelion structure which acts as a <a href="spire" class="uri" title="wikilink">spire</a> pierced the city atop a hill some time ago destroying much of city, though it has recovered by time the game starts. The main location of the game is a European-styled <a href="mansion" class="uri" title="wikilink">mansion</a> which is seen as completely out-of-place in the city. While it is the central storyline location, much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town attempting to meet characters to trigger event sequences.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>As indicated by the title, flowers, specifically dandelions, as well as vegetation in general, is a major theme in the game. Various sculptures and buildings were drawn with a flower <a href="Motif_(visual_arts)" title="wikilink">motif</a> in mind. Every outdoor and some indoor scenes have vegetation of some type in it. In addition, those that do not have any vegetation have something representing it in them.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>

<p>The player assumes the role of <a href="List_of_Popotan_characters#Chris" title="wikilink">Chris</a>, the protagonist of <em>Popotan</em>. He is a high school dropout who decided not to get a job because he's turned his back on society. He did this because he said he saw the direction it was heading and didn't like it. Because of this, he has been wandering for some time on the streets now making a living, what little he can, by playing the guitar. generally does not feel up to it without an audience and being a drifter makes that hard.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> As the game starts, he is wandering around and happens upon a mansion where he meets three sisters and their maid. <a href="List_of_Popotan_characters#Ai" title="wikilink">Ai</a> is the eldest of the three sisters. She acts a motherly figure for the other two. She has the ability to speak to plants. <a href="List_of_Popotan_characters#Mai" title="wikilink">Mai</a> is the middle sister. She acts very tomboyish and does not really like Chris staying with them at first. <a href="List_of_Popotan_characters#Mii" title="wikilink">Mii</a> is the youngest and by far the most energetic. She often <a href="cosplay" title="wikilink">cosplays</a> as &quot;Magical Girl Mii&quot;. <a href="List_of_Popotan_characters#Mea" title="wikilink">Mea</a>, their maid, comes off as emotionless at first, but as the game progresses she is shown to have a depth to her. Chris decides to stay with them<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> as they have cheap rent and he has very little money, though he quickly learns if he is to stay he'll have to change his ways.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="story">Story</h3>
<p><em>Popotan</em>'s story involves Chris's change in lifestyle. In some scenarios, the mysteries surrounding the large hill with the spire-like object are also explored. Chris is a <a href="slacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">slacker</a> from out of town who roams around the town doing just enough to get by.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The story opens sometime in the future with Chris near a food stand by a <a href="torii" title="wikilink">shrine entrance</a> without money and desperate enough to consider stealing food to just to survive. After this fails he wanders around town looking for someplace to work enough to feed himself and provide shelter. He finds a local <a href="convenience_store" title="wikilink">convenience store</a> where he gets directions which eventually lead him to the girls. He then continues to wander around town as he has no place else to go and hardly any money. When he arrives, he invites himself into the mansion and runs into the three sisters and their <a href="android" title="wikilink">human-looking android</a> maid. Chris decides to stay after finding out that the place was nice, the rent was cheap and he'd be staying under the same roof as four pretty girls as the only guy; upon learning his intentions about finding a place to stay, the girls agree to let him stay.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the following day he learns he will not be able to continue his slacker lifestyle if he wants to remain and is forced to take a part time job. The owner of the market who gave him directions agrees to hire him.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> As the story progresses, Chris opens up as he interacts with the girls and other people he meets. The story revolves around his change in attitude - he begins to care about people.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The scenerio development for <em>Popotan</em> was done by Iwashinichi Shimizu and Seki Hayabusa. Character design for the series was headed by Akio Watanabe under the alias Poyoyon Rock.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Music in the <em>Popotan</em> series was arranged by two composers, Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro with <a href="theme_(music)" title="wikilink">theme songs</a> sung by <a href="Under17" class="uri" title="wikilink">Under17</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> During the PS2 port, Aiko Watanabe was made the project supervisor.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> From May 2002 through June 2002 Petit Ferret requested applications for <a href="seiy&lt;U+016B&gt;" title="wikilink">voice actors</a> for <em>Popotan</em>. The initial requests were for the three sisters in the game.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Later, on June 30, 2002, Petite Ferret held open auditions for other roles.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="release-information">Release information</h3>
<p>On November 25, 2002 Petite Ferret released a trial version of <em>Popotan</em> for download.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The following month on December 13, 2002 <em>Popotan</em> was released for the PC on one CD-ROM.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Less than a year later on August 1, 2003 it was re-released for DVD-ROM with added enhancements under the title <em></em>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Although Petite Ferret had news of other titles, this was their last title released by them.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The following year WellMADE released a PS2 port of the game, <em></em>, on March 11, 2004.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The port lacked some of the more explicit sex scenes, but still contained enough to warrant a CERO 18 rating. Additional graphics and better gameplay were added to compensate for the removal of some of the content, especially those dealing with Mii.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Petite Ferret also released a fan disc for the game on July 11, 2003, shortly before the DVD-ROM release entitled <em></em>.</p>
<p>The initial release of the CD-ROM version of <em>Popotan</em> had several critical <a href="computer_bug" title="wikilink">errors</a> including the inability to get certain girls when following their path correctly and contained severe memory-related problems as well. These issues were quickly resolved with a hotfix on January 10, 2003.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Future versions of the game were released without such problems.</p>
<p>The initial release of <em>Popotan Fan Disc together with A&lt;U+30FB&gt;SO&lt;U+30FB&gt;BO</em><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> also had some issues. Although not as critical as those their parent product contained, they were nonetheless serious. Petit Ferret addressed these issues in two separate patches. The first patch adds missing voice data from the original CD that was intended for the game. The company offered to exchange existing CDs if a customer wanted to send their product in or they could download the necessary files from the website. On July 7, 2003 the company released a final patch for the game which includes grammatical corrections, difficulty fixes and overall stability enhancements. The second patch did not contain the fixes from the first.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>To increase pre-order sales, the initial CD-ROM release of <em>Popotan</em> launched with a special <a href="maxi_single" title="wikilink">maxi single</a> CD of the theme songs sung by Under17.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The PS2 port of <em>Popotan</em> was also initially released with a bonus <a href="theme_(arts)" title="wikilink">themed</a> <a href="telephone_card" title="wikilink">calling card</a>,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> reversible poster and music a CD to help entice early sales.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Popotan-box-cover.png" title="fig:Popotan: Complete Collection DVD Box Cover" alt="Popotan: Complete Collection DVD Box Cover" />  The anime series was produced by <a href="Shaft_(company)" title="wikilink">Shaft</a>, directed and storyboarded by <a href="Shinichiro_Kimura" title="wikilink">Shinichiro Kimura</a>, written by <a href="Jukki_Hanada" title="wikilink">Jukki Hanada</a> and featuring character designs by Haruka Sakurai based on Akio Watanabe's original concept with Rondo Mizukami oversee the animation.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> From July 17, 2003 through October 3, 2003 the twelve episodes of the <em>Popotan</em> anime was aired on <a href="Tokyo_Broadcasting_System" title="wikilink">TBS's satellite station BS-i</a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and was made available at the same time on <a href="Bandai" title="wikilink">Bandai Channel</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The opening theme song in the anime is done by Under17 in the same style they used for the game, while <a href="Funta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funta</a> did the ending theme song.</p>

<p>The series is very episodic<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> with each episode in the series, especially the first four, focuses on one of the four main characters of the anime.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> This allows them to show better how each of them deals with making friends and then leaving them abruptly. While the theme of focusing on an individual character remains throughout the whole series, a twist is added in that since they move forward in time, they meet up with the same people, only older, or their children and the complications that brings due to not aging.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Popotan</em> has been hard to classify as it defies any real genre or sub-genre with numerous exceptions to it. Although the anime has an overall comedic tone, the amount varies depending upon whom the episode centers around. It is an <a href="enigma" class="uri" title="wikilink">enigma</a> as to what audience the anime was intended for as there is periodic nudity in many episodes,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> though no sexually explicit scenes occur on camera.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In addition, the characters are very light-hearted wanting to help those they meet.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Geneon placed an age rating on the series of 16+ because of the nudity and language.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>During the release of the Volume 3 of the Japanese DVD release a misprint on the DVD's jacket numbering the episodes incorrectly. Bandai Visual offered free exchanges of the jackets to those who wanted them.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reception-and-sales">Reception and sales</h2>
<h3 id="visual-novel">Visual novel</h3>
<p>All of the <em>Popotan</em> visual novels released by Petit Ferret sold initially quite well. According to a national rating of <a href="bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo_game" title="wikilink">bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo games</a> by PCNews, an online Japanese news site, the initial CD-ROM release of <em>Popotan</em> was ninth approximately one-and-a-half months after its release<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></ref> and stayed on the charts half-a-month longer at twenty-first.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></ref> It reappeared briefly six months after the initial release at a ranking of forty-sixth<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></ref> shortly before the fan disc was released. The DVD-ROM re-release was listed as twenty-fourth in overall sales one month after its release.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></ref> When the fan disc was released, it was listed as the eleventh among the most sold bish&lt;U+014D&gt;jo game's within one month after its release.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></ref> The PS2 port, <em>Oshiete! Popotan</em>, received an aggregate score rating of 5.5 / 10 when it was released.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anime-1">Anime</h3>
<p>When the first English DVD was released in the US, <em>Popotan</em> got mixed reviews. Anime Jump gave it 1 and a 1/2 stars after stating that beyond the pretty pictures, &quot;it is created specifically to sell DVDs, tiny figurines, and other merchandise to <a href="introvert" title="wikilink">introverted</a> adult men.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> DVDtalk gave it a final rating of &quot;recommended&quot; with the only real criticism being the DVD's extras. The reviewer remarked that the first disc &quot;[...]was full of surprises for even a jaded old reviewer like myself.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the series has negative criticism, particularly from those who only reviewed the first DVD, those who have reviewed the series as a whole have taken a much more favorable stance,<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> with <a href="Allmovie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmovie</a> going so far as to give it 4/5 stars<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> and DVDtalk giving &quot;recommended&quot; to the first two discs and the series as a whole. Several reviewers have also praised the inability to easily classify <em>Popotan</em> into a specific genre or category of anime.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a><a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a><a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<p>The level of nudity and it's relation to the storyline has been widely contested. While Animetric and Mania have contended it is excessive,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> DVDtalk has mixed reviews on it with one claiming the scenes were out-of-place<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> while another stated the nudity was fine and appropriate.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a>. Both of the latter agree though that the amount was minor.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>The character designs by Akio Watanabe and animation in general have been praised even by those who otherwise criticize the series,<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> with Animetric.com claiming &quot;[c]haracter designs are glossy and distinctive, while scenes are detailed nicely and brightly rendered&quot;. The series musical score has also been well received being likened by Animetric.com as &quot;cutesy&quot; and &quot;...complementing the series perfectly.&quot;<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
