<p>The <strong><a href="2006_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> season</strong> marked the 60th anniversary of the Browns franchise. It began with the team attempting to improve upon their win-loss record from <a href="2005_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2005</a>, where the team ended the year at 6-10. They were one of the most active teams during the <a href="free_agency" title="wikilink">free agency</a> period, and looked to be one of the most improved teams of the season at the end of the NFL Draft. They experienced many setbacks during training camp, from which they never fully recovered. By the end of the season they had gone 4-12, losing two more games than the previous season.</p>

<h3 id="free-agency">Free agency</h3>
<p>The Cleveland Browns' front office was busy during the first several days off the free-agent signing period, looking to help the team by signing players who they felt would make immediate impacts upon the team. On the first day, the Browns signed <a href="Center_(American_football)" title="wikilink">center</a> <a href="LeCharles_Bentley" title="wikilink">LeCharles Bentley</a>, <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receiver</a> <a href="Joe_Jurevicius" title="wikilink">Joe Jurevicius</a>, and <a href="offensive_tackle" title="wikilink">offensive tackle</a> <a href="Kevin_Shaffer" title="wikilink">Kevin Shaffer</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Bentley and Shaffer were signed to help protect second-year <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Charlie_Frye" title="wikilink">Charlie Frye</a> in the pocket, and Jurevicius was signed to provide veteran support to the Browns' young receiving corps, which then-consisted of <a href="Braylon_Edwards" title="wikilink">Braylon Edwards</a>, <a href="Joshua_Cribbs" title="wikilink">Joshua Cribbs</a>, and veteran <a href="Dennis_Northcutt" title="wikilink">Dennis Northcutt</a>. On the second day of the free-agent period, the Browns signed <a href="Punter_(football_position)" title="wikilink">punter</a> <a href="Dave_Zastudil" title="wikilink">Dave Zastudil</a> to replace <a href="Kyle_Richardson" title="wikilink">Kyle Richardson</a>, and to establish a good punting game.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> An interesting fact about the Browns' free-agent signings deals with the fact that Bentley, Jurevicius, and Zastudil are each <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>-natives, and expressed their wish to play for the Browns at some point in their careers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A day after signing Zastudil, the Browns signed veteran nose tackle <a href="Ted_Washington" title="wikilink">Ted Washington</a> in an attempt to improve the Browns' run defense.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After signing Washington, the Browns made their final key free-agent signing, by inking a deal with <a href="linebacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">linebacker</a> <a href="Willie_McGinest" title="wikilink">Willie McGinest</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> McGinest was signed to provide veteran support among the Browns' linebacking corps, and brought back under the direction of head coach <a href="Romeo_Crennel" title="wikilink">Romeo Crennel</a>, who coached McGinest defensively through three <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowls</a> while in <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nfl-draft">2006 NFL Draft</h3>
<p>As the <a href="2006_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2006 NFL Draft</a> neared in late April, the Browns had already filled in many of their holes through free agency, and would primarily be looking for players who would help the 3-4 defense. The Browns has their eyes set on <a href="Haloti_Ngata" title="wikilink">Haloti Ngata</a>, who they would presumably build up to take over for Ted Washington. On the day of the draft, the Browns traded their 12th pick to the <a href="Baltimore_Ravens" title="wikilink">Baltimore Ravens</a> for the 13th pick and a 6th round pick. Baltimore used the pick to take Ngata, while the Browns selected outside linebacker <a href="Kamerion_Wimbley" title="wikilink">Kamerion Wimbley</a>, the player who Cleveland GM <a href="Phil_Savage" title="wikilink">Phil Savage</a> had wanted the whole time.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The seletion of inside linebacker <a href="D&#39;Qwell_Jackson" title="wikilink">D'Qwell Jackson</a> in the second round created a linebacker core of <a href="Andra_Davis" title="wikilink">Andra Davis</a>, Jackson, McGinest, and Wimbley. Wide receiver <a href="Travis_Wilson" title="wikilink">Travis Wilson</a> was selected in the 3rd round as a developmental project and future possession receiver.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On day two of the draft, seven other players were taken; linebacker <a href="Leon_Williams" title="wikilink">Leon Williams</a>, tackle <a href="Isaac_Sowells" title="wikilink">Isaac Sowells</a>, running back <a href="Jerome_Harrison" title="wikilink">Jerome Harrison</a>, cornerback <a href="DeMario_Minter" title="wikilink">DeMario Minter</a>, fullback <a href="Lawrence_Vickers" title="wikilink">Lawrence Vickers</a>, nose tackle <a href="Babatunde_Oshinowo" title="wikilink">Babatunde Oshinowo</a>, and safety <a href="Justin_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Justin Hamilton</a>. Minter ended up being the only rookie not playing a down that season due to injury The way the Browns handled the draft was mostly praised, filling in their voids and finding future starters in late rounds.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trades">Trades</h3>
<p>During the 2006 off-season, the Cleveland Browns made two significant trades. Their first would be trading veteran <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Trent_Dilfer" title="wikilink">Trent Dilfer</a> to the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> for fourth-year quarterback <a href="Ken_Dorsey" title="wikilink">Ken Dorsey</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The trade was an important step in solidifying second-year quarterback <a href="Charlie_Frye" title="wikilink">Charlie Frye</a> as the Browns' starting quarterback heading into the 2006 regular season. The other important trade the Browns made would fill the void at center left by newly-acquired free agent <a href="LeCharles_Bentley" title="wikilink">LeCharles Bentley</a>. The Browns traded a conditional 2008 draft choice to the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a> for <a href="Center_(American_football)" title="wikilink">center</a> <a href="Hank_Fraley" title="wikilink">Hank Fraley</a>. The Browns subsequently signed Fraley to a one-year contract.</p>
<h3 id="center-troubles-during-training-camp">Center troubles during training camp</h3>
<p>On <a href="July_27" title="wikilink">July 27</a>, the first day of the Cleveland Browns' training camp, free-agent center LeCharles Bentley suffered a season-ending knee injury during the first contact play of camp.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Bentley was quoted as saying, &quot;No one touched me. It was a freak thing. I took two steps, felt the injury and that was it. It felt like someone had kicked me.&quot; Bentley also said that he's &quot;[...] never been a patient person,&quot; and that &quot;[...] [l]earning to adjust my body and my limitations is going to be a difficult challenge. When it's all said and done, it's going to make me better.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Bentley was expected to help protect second-year quarterback Charlie Frye.</p>
<p>After news of Bentley's injuring, back-up center <a href="Bob_Hallen" title="wikilink">Bob Hallen</a> left training camp, leaving the team without a center. On <a href="July_30" title="wikilink">July 30</a>, the Browns signed veteran center <a href="Todd_Washington" title="wikilink">Todd Washington</a>. On <a href="August_7" title="wikilink">August 7</a>, Washington annonced his retirement. On <a href="August_12" title="wikilink">August 12</a>, Hallen announced his retirment, citing two herniated discs and <a href="stenosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">stenosis</a> as the reason for his retirment.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Browns faced even more problems when third-string center Alonzo Ephraim, who was signed following Bentley's injury, was suspended for substance abuse.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="August_17" title="wikilink">August 17</a> saw the Browns center woes disparaging slightly, as they acquired <a href="Ross_Tucker" title="wikilink">Ross Tucker</a> from the Patriots.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On <a href="August_24" title="wikilink">August 24</a>, the Browns acquired center <a href="Lennie_Friedman" title="wikilink">Lennie Friedman</a> from the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> for a conditional 2007 draft choice.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On <a href="September_2" title="wikilink">September 2</a>, the Browns finally found what they had been looking for when they traded a conditional 2008 draft choice to the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a> for center <a href="Hank_Fraley" title="wikilink">Hank Fraley</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Upon signing Fraley, Ross Tucker's contract was terminated.</p>

An 8-minute opening drive by the Jets would result in a <a href="Mike_Nugent" title="wikilink">Mike Nugent</a> 27-yard field goal, which the Browns matched with a <a href="Phil_Dawson" title="wikilink">Phil Dawson</a> 47-yard kick.

After a Browns punt, the Jets moved down the field and got a 47-yard field goal from Nugent. The Browns offense stalled out in the fourth quarter, but the defense played well. Sean Jones got another interception midway through the fourth quarter, and a late drive by the Jets failed as <a href="Chad_Pennington" title="wikilink">Chad Pennington</a>'s final throw to the endzone was caught by <a href="Chris_Baker_(football_player)" title="wikilink">Chris Baker</a>; however, the officials ruled that he would have landed out of bounds even if the Browns' <a href="Brodney_Pool" title="wikilink">Brodney Pool</a> hadn't pushed him.

<p><em>at the <a href="Georgia_Dome" title="wikilink">Georgia Dome</a>, <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a></em></p>
<p>Facing a desperate season verging on the point of disaster yet again, the Browns traveled again in Week 10 to the <a href="Georgia_Dome" title="wikilink">Georgia Dome</a> in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a> to meet the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>. The 5-3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a>. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback <a href="Charlie_Frye" title="wikilink">Charlie Frye</a> connected on a 40-yard pass to wide receiver <a href="Kellen_Winslow,_Jr." title="wikilink">Kellen Winslow</a>. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back <a href="Reuben_Droughns" title="wikilink">Reuben Droughns</a> and the Browns took a 7-0 lead. The second quarter started with a bang for the Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback <a href="Michael_Vick" title="wikilink">Michael Vick</a> threw an interception to Browns safety <a href="Sean_Jones_(safety)" title="wikilink">Sean Jones</a>. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, <a href="Charlie_Frye" title="wikilink">Charlie Frye</a> connected with tight end <a href="Braylon_Edwards" title="wikilink">Braylon Edwards</a> on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26. However, Falcons kicker <a href="Morten_Andersen" title="wikilink">Morten Andersen</a> kicked a 44-yard field goal to get on the board 14-3 at halftime</p>
<p>Very little happened in the third quarter. <a href="Michael_Vick" title="wikilink">Michael Vick</a> was driving in Cleveland territory with 5:28 remaining when he was intercepted again by Browns safety <a href="Brodney_Pool" title="wikilink">Brodney Pool</a>. However, the ensuing Browns possession resulted in a <a href="Dave_Zastudil" title="wikilink">Dave Zastudil</a> punt. The punt was out of their own endzone and was returned to the Browns 12. It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver <a href="Michael_Jenkins" title="wikilink">Michael Jenkins</a> for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. Things started to look grim for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained great field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal. The lead was a mere point for the Browns at 14-13. The next drive for the Browns looked promising. After two passes to tight end <a href="Steve_Heiden" title="wikilink">Steve Heiden</a> and a 36-yard pass to <a href="Kellen_Winslow,_Jr." title="wikilink">Kellen Winslow</a>, the Browns then faltered and had to settle for a 43-yard <a href="Phil_Dawson" title="wikilink">Phil Dawson</a> field goal. The score was 17-13.</p>
<p>With 3:18 remaining in the game, Atlanta took over on their own 28-yard line. Down by 4, Vick let in loose downfield to an open receiver <a href="Roddy_White" title="wikilink">Roddy White</a> for a 55-yard gain. The Falcons then committed a 10-yard penalty and Vick threw an incomplete pass. With 2nd and 20 on the Cleveland 27, the unthinkable happened for the <a href="Georgia_Dome" title="wikilink">Georgia Dome</a> faithful. Vick fumbled the ball on 3rd down to a waiting Browns rookie cornerback <a href="Jereme_Perry" title="wikilink">Jereme Perry</a>. Out of timeouts, the Falcons fans watched as their team fell for a second week in a row to a bottom-feeder team...and the Browns celebrated their third victory, winning by the skin of their teeth.</p>

In the second quarter, QB <a href="Carson_Palmer" title="wikilink">Carson Palmer</a> completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR <a href="Chris_Henry" title="wikilink">Chris Henry</a>, while kicker <a href="Shayne_Graham" title="wikilink">Shayne Graham</a> got a 24-yard field goal for another uncontested 10 points.

In the fourth, Palmer and Henry wrapped up the game on a 10-yard TD pass, shutting out the Cleveland Browns on their home field, 30-0. With the second loss in a row at their home stadium, the Browns fell to 3-8.</p>
<p><a href="Braylon_Edwards" title="wikilink">Braylon Edwards</a> was involved in a highly-publicized altercation with <a href="Charlie_Frye" title="wikilink">Charlie Frye</a> on the sideline during the game, resulting in Edwards issuing a formal apology for his actions.</p>

<p>The Browns came into the game hoping to rebound from the humiliating loss to the Bengals. They came out strong, striking first with a touchdown pass from Frye to Braylon Edwards, and an impressive defensive stop. The <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Chiefs</a> responded, however, and <a href="Trent_Green" title="wikilink">Trent Green</a> tied the game up 7-7 on a 22 yard pass to <a href="Eddie_Kennison" title="wikilink">Eddie Kennison</a>. They scored again 8 minutes later, this time a 9 yard TD pass to <a href="Tony_Gonzalez" title="wikilink">Tony Gonzalez</a>. The Browns fought back, and just before halftime, Droughns ran 1 yard into the endzone, to tie it up at 14 going into halftime. Starting QB Charlie Frye was injured in the first half and, despite attempting a return, came out in the third quarter with a brace on his wrist and no shoulder pads. <a href="Derek_Anderson_(football_player)" title="wikilink">Derek Anderson</a> took over the game for the Browns.</p>
<p>The second half started out poorly, as Kansas City scored two more touchdowns on passes to <a href="Kris_Wilson_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Kris Wilson</a> and Tony Gonzalez. The Browns came back to life in the final 9 minutes, with two touchdown passes from Anderson to Steve Heiden, one with 30 seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>In overtime, the Chiefs won the toss, but the stingy Browns defense forced a punt. A key pass from Anderson to Winslow moved the ball up, and Anderson came back out and ran for a large 33-yard gain, bringing the ball inside the 20 yard line. (It was the longest run from scrimmage for the Browns so far during the season.) Dawson sealed the deal with a 33-yard field goal to win the game.</p>

In the fourth quarter, the only thing that the Browns could muster was Dawson's 36-yard field goal. With four-straight losses to end the season, Cleveland ended its season at 4-12. The Browns season ended with 12 players in the Injured Reserve list, many of them starters.</p>
