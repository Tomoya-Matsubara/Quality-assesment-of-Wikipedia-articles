<p><strong>Presque Isle State Park</strong> () is a  <a href="List_of_Pennsylvania_state_parks" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania state park</a> on an arching sandy <a href="peninsula" class="uri" title="wikilink">peninsula</a> that juts into <a href="Lake_Erie" title="wikilink">Lake Erie</a>,  west of the city of <a href="Erie,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Erie</a>, in <a href="Millcreek_Township,_Erie_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Millcreek Township</a>, <a href="Erie_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Erie County</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>, in the United States. The peninsula sweeps northeastward, surrounding <a href="Presque_Isle_Bay" title="wikilink">Presque Isle Bay</a> along the park's southern coast. It has  of roads,  of recreational trails, 13 beaches for swimming, and a marina. Popular activities at the park include <a href="human_swimming" title="wikilink">swimming</a>, <a href="boating" class="uri" title="wikilink">boating</a>, <a href="hiking" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiking</a>, <a href="biking" class="uri" title="wikilink">biking</a>, and <a href="bird_watching" title="wikilink">bird watching</a>.</p>
<p>The recorded history of Presque Isle begins with the <a href="Erie_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Erielhonan</a>, a <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> tribe who gave their name to Lake Erie, and includes French, <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a>, and American forts, as well as serving as a base for <a href="Commodore_(USN)" title="wikilink">Commodore</a> <a href="Oliver_Hazard_Perry" title="wikilink">Oliver Hazard Perry</a>'s fleet in the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>. With the growing importance of <a href="ship_transport" title="wikilink">shipping</a> on Lake Erie in the 1800s, Presque Isle became home to several <a href="lighthouse" title="wikilink">lighthouses</a> and what became a <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> station. In 1921 it became a state park, and as of 2007 it hosts over 4 million visitors per year, the most of any Pennsylvania state park.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Presque Isle peninsula formed on a <a href="moraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">moraine</a> from the end of the <a href="Wisconsin_Glaciation" title="wikilink">Wisconsin Glaciation</a> and is constantly being reshaped by waves and wind. This leads to seven ecological zones within the park, which provide a classic example of <a href="ecological_succession" title="wikilink">ecological succession</a>. A <a href="National_Natural_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Natural Landmark</a> since 1967, the park has been named one of the best places in the US to <a href="birding" title="wikilink">watch birds</a>, and protects them in its Gull Point State Park Natural Area. The new <a href="Tom_Ridge_Environmental_Center" title="wikilink">Tom Ridge Environmental Center</a> at the entrance to the park allows visitors to learn more about the park and its ecology. Presque Isle State Park has been chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of &quot;Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="early-inhabitants">Early inhabitants</h3>
<p>Presque Isle was formed at the end of the <a href="Last_ice_age" title="wikilink">Wisconsin Glaciation</a> about 11,000 years ago.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The earliest known inhabitants of the southern Lake Erie coast were the <a href="Erie_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Erielhonan</a>, also known as the &quot;Eriez&quot;, an <a href="Iroquoian_languages" title="wikilink">Iroquoian</a> speaking tribe of <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>. Erielhonan meant the &quot;Cat&quot; or &quot;Raccoon&quot; people, and the name &quot;Erie&quot;, a corruption of Erielhonan, became the name of the lake and county in which Presque Isle Park is found and of the city nearest the park.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>An Erielhonan legend taught that the <a href="Great_Spirit" title="wikilink">Great Spirit</a> led them to Presque Isle because of the wealth of <a href="game_(food)" title="wikilink">game</a>, the abundance of clean <a href="fresh_water" title="wikilink">fresh water</a>, and the cool breezes &quot;coming from the land of snow and ice&quot;, i.e. Canada. Another legend explains how the Eriez ventured into Lake Erie in search of the land where the sun set.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The spirit of the lake blew a fierce storm to keep the Eriez from finding the sun. To protect the Eriez from the storm, their god laid his outstretched arm into the lake, giving them safety during the storm. The god's arm remained in the lake, protecting the tribe's future generations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The Erielhonan are believed to have lived and farmed on the peninsula.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> They fought several wars, the last starting in 1653 with the Five Nations of the <a href="Iroquois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iroquois</a>. After initial victories over the <a href="Seneca_tribe" title="wikilink">Senecas</a>, in 1654 the Erielhonan lost their largest village, Rique (at the modern city of Erie), destroyed by 1,800 Iroquois warriors. By 1656 the Erielhonan were destroyed as a people, although the Iroquois adopted survivors, absorbed primarily into the Senecas.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="forts-settlers-and-war-of-1812">Forts, settlers, and War of 1812</h3>
<p>The French first named the peninsula in the 1720s; <em><a href="presque-isle" class="uri" title="wikilink">presque-isle</a></em> means peninsula (lit. &quot;almost an island&quot;) in French. They built <a href="Fort_Presque_Isle" title="wikilink">Fort Presque Isle</a> at the modern city of Erie in the summer of 1753, naming it for the peninsula that protected the fort. The French also built two &quot;military outposts&quot; (probably of brick) on Presque Isle itself, one at the entrance to the peninsula and the other at the eastern point.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> During the <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a>, the French abandoned their outposts and burned their fort in 1759.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The British constructed a new fort of the same name that year, which later fell to Native American forces on June 19, 1763, during <a href="Pontiac&#39;s_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Pontiac's Rebellion</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Perry_memorial.jpg" title="fig:The Perry Monument on Presque Isle commemorates the U.S. naval victory on Lake Erie in the War of 1812.|alt=A tall, stone column at the end of a sidewalk, with leafless trees on either side of the sidewalk." alt="The Perry Monument on Presque Isle commemorates the U.S. naval victory on Lake Erie in the War of 1812.|alt=A tall, stone column at the end of a sidewalk, with leafless trees on either side of the sidewalk." /> Presque Isle passed from British to American control after the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>, and the Iroquois sold their rights to the land containing the peninsula to the United States at the second <a href="Treaty_of_Fort_Stanwix_(1784)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a> in 1784. Pennsylvania did not acquire an undisputed title to the land until it purchased the <a href="Erie_Triangle" title="wikilink">Erie Triangle</a> from the Federal government on April 3, 1792. In 1795 General <a href="Anthony_Wayne" title="wikilink">Anthony Wayne</a> built a new, American &quot;Fort Presque Isle&quot;, and on April 18 of that year the town of &quot;Presqu' Ile&quot;, since renamed Erie, was laid out near it. Wayne died at the fort on December 15, 1796, and was originally buried there.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Erie_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Erie County</a> was formed from <a href="Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Allegheny County</a> on March 12, 1800. <a href="Millcreek_Township,_Erie_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Millcreek Township</a>, which initially contained both the Presque Isle peninsula and village of Erie, was one of the original townships. Erie was named the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> in 1803, incorporated as a borough in 1805, and became a city in 1851.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>, Presque Isle played a part in the victory over the British in the <a href="Battle_of_Lake_Erie" title="wikilink">Battle of Lake Erie</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Oliver Hazard Perry, commander of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay to build a pier and a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet; some of the timber used probably came from Presque Isle. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The &quot;Little Bay&quot; near the tip of the peninsula where the ships sheltered, next to the current Perry's Monument, was later named &quot;Misery Bay&quot; because of the hardships during the winter of 1813&lt;U+2013&gt;1814, after the men returned there from battle.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Many men suffered from <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a> and were kept in <a href="quarantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarantine</a> near the bay. A great many infected men died and were buried in what is now called Graveyard Pond.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Perry's two largest ships were badly damaged, and the <a href="USS_Lawrence_(1813)" title="wikilink">US Brig <em>Lawrence</em></a> was intentionally sunk in Misery Bay. The <em>Lawrence</em> was raised in 1875 but was burned while on display at the 1876 <a href="Centennial_Exposition" title="wikilink">Centennial Exposition</a>. The <a href="USS_Niagara_(1813)" title="wikilink">US Brig <em>Niagara</em></a> was initially repaired, then sunk for preservation in 1820 and raised in 1913, and parts of it were eventually used in the modern <a href="U.S._Brig_Niagara_(replica)" title="wikilink"><em>Niagara</em></a>, based across Presque Isle Bay in Erie.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Presque_Isle_Lighthouse_2.jpg" title="fig:The Presque Isle Light began operation in 1873 and is still in service today.|alt=A brick house with a white, square lighthouse tower attached to the house." alt="The Presque Isle Light began operation in 1873 and is still in service today.|alt=A brick house with a white, square lighthouse tower attached to the house." /> The Presque Isle peninsula forms Presque Isle Bay, which serves as a natural harbor for Erie. During the 19th century, as Lake Erie navigation grew more important, shipping aids were built on Presque Isle. As of 2007, two main <a href="lighthouses" class="uri" title="wikilink">lighthouses</a> can be found in the park. The <a href="Erie_Harbor_North_Pier_Light" title="wikilink">Erie Harbor North Pier Light</a> began as a wooden tower, erected in 1830. In 1858, a stronger steel structure was brought from France and installed at Erie to replace the wooden beacon, which had been damaged by a schooner. This light still stands at the far eastern side of the park, near the inlet between the lake and the bay.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Presque_Isle_Light" title="wikilink">Presque Isle Light</a> was constructed in 1872 on the north side of Presque Isle and was lit on July 12, 1873. This light is  tall, with a red brick house that is used as a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the <a href="Erie_Waterworks" title="wikilink">Erie Waterworks</a> on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula. Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Erie <a href="water_taxi" title="wikilink">water taxi</a> service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="United_States_Life-Saving_Service" title="wikilink">United States Life-Saving Service</a> District 9 opened a life-saving station (LSS) at Presque Isle in 1876. William Clark was the keeper from 1877 until he drowned in 1891. He was succeeded by Andrew Jansen, who was the keeper until 1914. When the Life-Saving Service and the <a href="Revenue_Cutter_Service" title="wikilink">Revenue Cutter Service</a> merged in 1915 to become the <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a>, LSS Presque Isle, also called the Erie life-saving station, became Coast Guard Station #236. The station, still in operation, is assigned to the Ninth District of the United States Coast Guard.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="modern-era-and-state-park">Modern era and state park</h3>
<p>In 1908, Erie started building a <a href="waterworks" class="uri" title="wikilink">waterworks</a> on Presque Isle to provide <a href="fresh_water" title="wikilink">fresh water</a> for the city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two <a href="reservoir" title="wikilink">basins</a> on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to <a href="Water_purification#Sedimentation" title="wikilink">settle</a>, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for <a href="zebra_mussel" title="wikilink">zebra mussel</a> control and as a concession stand for bicycle and surrey rentals within the state park.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

Oversight was given to the new &quot;State Park and Harbor Commission of Erie&quot;, including local representation, instead of to the state Department of Forests and Waters. Presque Isle quickly became the most popular state park in Pennsylvania. Presque Isle was an early example of locating state parks near cities, a trend that would become prevalent statewide only in the 1960s.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The first paved road was built in the park in 1924,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and today 13 miles (21 km) of roads run through the park.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_832" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Route 832</a>, which is the main road to the park, is also known as Peninsula Drive.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Presque Isle has been referred to as &quot;Peninsula State Park&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Perry Monument in the park was constructed in 1926 near Misery Bay and the burials in Graveyard Pond.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1937 official state publications were referring to the park as &quot;Presque Isle State Park&quot;,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and that same year it led the state park system with 1.4 million visitors. In the 1950s the peninsula was enlarged to accommodate new roads and parking, using 3 million cubic yards (2,294,000 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of sand dredged from the interior of the peninsula. The resulting basin became the current marina. Other new facilities included three modern bath houses built in 1957.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> That same year Gull Point (at the eastern end of the peninsula) was named a nature preserve by the state.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1967, Presque Isle was named a <a href="National_Natural_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Natural Landmark</a> by the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> A recommendation was made to abolish the independent board as early as 1930, although this did not come about until January 19, 1971, with the creation of the state Department of Environmental Resources (which later became the DCNR).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> From 1989 to 1992, over 50 <a href="breakwater_(structure)" title="wikilink">breakwaters</a> were built along the western and northern shore of the peninsula to help control erosion.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> As part of the <em>State Parks 2000</em> of the <a href="Pennsylvania_Department_of_Conservation_and_Natural_Resources" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a> (DCNR) strategic plan, Gull Point was named a &quot;State Park Natural Area for rare and migratory shorebirds to rest, feed and possibly nest&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Tom_Ridge_Environmental_Center" title="wikilink">Tom Ridge Environmental Center</a> at the entrance to the park opened in May 2006. As of 2007, the Pennsylvania DCNR Bureau of Parks, which administers all 120 Pennsylvania state parks, had chosen Presque Isle for its &quot;Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot; list, citing its status as Pennsylvania's only surf beach, its status as a National Natural Landmark, and its &quot;geological and biological diversity and its historic significance&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> It was included as one of 16 featured in the first ever official Pennsylvania state parks calendar (for 2008).<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Scenes for the film <a href="The_Road_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>The Road</em></a> were shot at Presque Isle in April 2008, with Beach 10 used as a seashore.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A weak <a href="tornado" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornado</a> touched down in the state park on June 27, 2010. Rated an EF0 on the <a href="Enhanced_Fujita_Scale" title="wikilink">Enhanced Fujita Scale</a>, it downed power lines and trees near the Stull Interpretive Center, and also damaged a nearby observation platform.

The ice sheet advanced into the basin now occupied by <a href="Lake_Erie" title="wikilink">Lake Erie</a>, stopped for a while, and retreated to the north, leaving behind a <a href="moraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">moraine</a>. This <a href="moraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">moraine</a> marks the terminus of the episode of ice advance, consists of clay, sand, and gravel, and eventually became the Presque Isle peninsula.

<p>As noted, the name <em>presque-isle</em> literally means &quot;almost an island&quot; in French. In fact, Presque Isle has been an island rather than a peninsula for brief periods.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> It has been cut off from the mainland four times since 1819, the longest stretch being the 32 years from 1832 to 1864, and each time the <a href="United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> has reconnected it.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The peninsula was breached five times between 1917 and 1922, the year after Presque Isle became a state park. While repair efforts then included plugging the breach with bales of hay and wood, in the 1950s a state and federal program built a concrete <a href="seawall" class="uri" title="wikilink">seawall</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Fifty-eight breakwaters, built by 1992 to slow <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a>, have &quot;captured&quot; the sand and significantly slowed its movement eastward.

<p>The remaining ecological zones, with their progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic illustration of the concept of <a href="ecological_succession" title="wikilink">ecological succession</a>. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of <a href="Odonata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odonata</a> (dragonflies and damselflies) and <a href="Lepidoptera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lepidoptera</a>, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

Dunes grow and are stabilized by grasses, followed by other types of vegetation. This provides habitat for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old dunes can become more permanent ridges, which shelter ponds. These dunes, ridges, and ponds are often remnants of previous shorelines; at the Presque Isle State Park &quot;Long Pond&quot; just east of the marina, dunes and ridges mark the eastern shoreline from 1862.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The fifth ecological zone consists of old ponds and marshes. Ponds protected by dunes and ridges are more stable; these old ponds support more plant and animal life, and as they fill with vegetation, they become marshes. Old ponds and marshes have high <a href="biodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Nearly 400 species of terrestrial vertebrates live on Presque Isle, including 318 different birds, 48 kinds of mammals, 13 types of amphibians, and 19 reptile species.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The sixth and seventh ecological zones are characterized by their shrubs and trees, and Presque Isle State Park is home to 633 plant species (195 <a href="Monocotyledon" title="wikilink">Monocotyledons</a>, 410 <a href="Dicotyledon" title="wikilink">Dicotyledons</a>, 5 <a href="Gymnosperm" title="wikilink">Gymnosperms</a>, 5 <a href="Horsetail" title="wikilink">Horsetails</a>, 13 <a href="Fern" title="wikilink">Ferns</a>, and 5 <a href="Moss" title="wikilink">Mosses</a>).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The sixth zone, thicket and sub-climax forest, forms when shrubs grow on dying marshes, followed by small trees. The trees shade and thin out the thickets of shrubs, leading to a sub-climax forest. The seventh and final stage is climax forest, where many large trees form a <a href="Canopy_(forest)" title="wikilink">canopy</a>. If left undisturbed, this ecological succession is believed to take 600 or more years, although visitors to parts of Presque Isle State Park can walk through all of these zones in .<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The Pennsylvania <a href="Audubon_Society" title="wikilink">Audubon Society</a> has listed the park as Pennsylvania <a href="Important_Bird_Area" title="wikilink">Important Bird Area</a> (IBA) #1, and it has been rated by <em>Birder's World</em> magazine as one the best places in the United States for birdwatching.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The diversity of <a href="habitat_(ecology)" title="wikilink">habitats</a> on the peninsula makes it an ideal home for over 320 species of birds.

<h3 id="gull-point-natural-area">Gull Point Natural Area</h3>
<p>Human beings have played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is hindered or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

These areas provide locations for scientific observation of natural systems; they protect examples of natural interest and beauty as well as examples of unique and typical animal and plant habitats.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Gull Point covers , of which  form the Natural Area and are closed to park visitors during the height of the bird migrations. The natural area is a safe haven and resting spot for migrating and nesting birds. Many of the species of birds that rest at Gull Point are not seen anywhere else in Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Presque Isle lies on the <a href="Atlantic_Flyway" title="wikilink">Atlantic Flyway</a>, a major migratory path, and some of these birds migrate from as far north as the <a href="Arctic_Circle" title="wikilink">Arctic Circle</a> to South America. They pass through in November on their long flights south and return in April on their flights north.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Erosion and deposition of sand, which has formed Gull Point, continues to change it. From May 1991 to October 2006, Gull Point lost a total of , and if this trend continues, it may become an island. After the breakwaters were constructed in 1992, less sand was added to replenish the beaches. Federal funding of sand replenishment has been cut off since 2005, leading to further reduction in sand added to the peninsula. Without new sand, erosion has reduced the northern beaches of Gull Point, even while regions to the east and south have continued to grow at a slower rate, for a net yearly loss of .<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
