<p>The <strong>Allogromiida</strong> are a group of monothalamous (single-chambered), mostly organic-walled <a href="foraminifera" title="wikilink">foraminiferans</a>, including some that produce agglutinated tests (Lagynacea). Genetic studies have shown that some foraminiferans with agglutinated tests, previously included in the <a href="Textulariida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Textulariida</a> or as their own order Astrorhizida, also belong here. Allogromiids produce relatively simple tests, usually with a single chamber, similar to those of other protists such as <em><a href="Gromia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gromia</a></em>. They are found in both marine and freshwater forms, and are the oldest forams known from the fossil record.</p>
