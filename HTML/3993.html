<p><a href="St._Mary&#39;s_College_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">St. Mary's College of Maryland</a>, originally known as <strong>St. Mary's Female Seminary</strong>, began in 1840 as a <a href="secular" class="uri" title="wikilink">secular</a> state-sponsored boarding school for women. Since 1966 it has been a four-year public liberal arts college. Since 1992 it has been a designated public honors college. One of only two in the nation to hold such a distinction at the time.</p>
<p>The history spans from the early colonial days of St. Mary's City through to the present, including the establishment of religious tolerance and it's later loss, long periods of oppression followed by the expansion of freedom as the result of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, and through the 19th and 20th centuries to the modern day public honors college.</p>

<p>Colonial St. Mary's City was actually only a town and at its peak had between 500 and 600 residents. However as the colony quickly expanded and settlements spread throughout the Eastern part of what is now Maryland, the town remained the capitol and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony's first legislative body.</p>
<p>The Colony was founded under a mandate by the colonial proprietor, <a href="Cecil_Calvert,_2nd_Baron_Baltimore" title="wikilink">Cecil Calvert</a>, the second Lord Baltimore of England, that the new settlers engage in <a href="religious_tolerance" title="wikilink">religious tolerance</a> of each other.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The first settlers were both Protestant and Catholic during a time of persecution of Catholics.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This mandate was unprecedented at the time, as England had been wracked by religious conflict for centuries.</p>

<p>St. Mary's College, which has a close partnership with Historic St. Mary's City,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> was able to put together the following events through a combination or archeological and historic research.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1634, at the time of the arrival of the first colonists, there was a <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> village on the site that was a part of the Yaocomico branch of the <a href="Piscataway_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Piscataway Indian Nation</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Archeological research shows the presence of native peoples in the area going back more than 10,000 years.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>When the colonists first came ashore, the paramount chief of the Yaocomico was already well aware of Europeans due to earlier contact with explorers and traders, as well as news from Virginia tribes that were already co-existing with British colonial settlements. The chief was keen to establish trade with the English and he was also in the process of relocating his people due to war with another tribe. Soon after the new colonists arrived in what is now St. Mary's City, he ordered the Indian village cleared and he sold it to the settlers.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The colonists initially lived in Indian longhouses from the prior village, along with some remaining Yaocomico people who had stayed behind to help them. During this period, the Yaocomico taught the colonists how to survive in Maryland's challenging environment.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The chief also later put his daughter, the Piscataway Indian princess, Mary Kittamaquund,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> under the guardianship of a prominent colonist, Margaret Brent,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> so that Mary could learn English ways and become a bridge and a translator between the two cultures. Her English first name was given to her by the colonists.</p>

<p><strong>1968: Establishment of St. Mary's City Commission (later named &quot;Historic Mary's City&quot;):</strong> The St. Mary's City Commission was charged with archeological and historical research of St. Mary's City and its rich colonial past, as well as its critical roles in the development of democracy in Maryland and North America as a whole. The commission was also charged with developing historic interpretation programs for the general public.</p>
<p>Although a separate institution from he school, over time, St. Mary's College and Historic st.

<h3 id="public-honors-college-designation">1992: &quot;Public Honors College&quot; designation</h3>
<p><strong>Ted Lewis:</strong> Due to the efforts of then St. Mary's College President <a href="Edward_T._Lewis_(College_president)" title="wikilink">Ted Lewis</a>, the school was designated by the state of Maryland as a Public Honors College in 1992,<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a><a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a><a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> making it one of only two such colleges in the nation at the time.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>Lewis was drawn to the school by its goal of developing a public liberal arts college into an institution that could compete academically with elite private colleges. He served as president from 1982 to 1996 and oversaw the largest advancement of the school's standing in its history. The school went on to win numerous top national rankings and became nationally recognized.</p>
<p>Lewis himself had grown up in a blue collar family in Warwick Rhode Island, his father only had an eighth grade education and so Lewis was in the first generation of his family to attend college. Initially he wasn't able to stay engaged with his studies and he dropped out, but later, after a period of military service, he returned to pursuing an education, following through all the way to obtaining a Doctorate degree and then becoming an educator and later a college administrator. He was also a noted and very prolific poet in his younger days.</p>
<p>During his time as president, Lewis oversaw an expansion of the Brent scholars program for first generation college students. He also oversaw a more than doubling of the school's African-American student population from 6% in 1982, to 14% in 1992.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> During this era, the State Legislature also charged the school with a mission to remain affordable to public education sector students,<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> while offering a Liberal Arts education normally only available at private liberal arts colleges.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Growing pains:</strong> The college struggled to meet this cost containment goal, as it had also been required by the state to grow considerably at the same time, across numerous dimensions, in order to fulfill its new role as the state's public honors college.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> This era also saw steady increases in tuition.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>

Ivy league schools are also competing heavily for top minority students. First generation college students of all races come from families still recovering from the recession.</p>
