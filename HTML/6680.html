<p>In <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a>, the <strong>name of God</strong> is more than a distinguishing title. It represents the Jewish conception of the divine nature, and of the relation of <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> to the <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> people. In awe at the <a href="sacred" title="wikilink">sacredness</a> of the names of God, and as a means of showing respect and reverence for them, the <a href="scribe" title="wikilink">scribes</a> of <a href="sacred_text" title="wikilink">sacred texts</a> took pause before copying them, and used terms of reverence so as to keep the true name of God concealed. The various names of God in Judaism represent God as he is known, as well as the divine aspects which are attributed to him.</p>
<p>The numerous names of God have been a source of debate amongst biblical scholars — some have advanced the variety as proof that the <a href="Torah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torah</a> has many authors (see <a href="documentary_hypothesis" title="wikilink">documentary hypothesis</a>), while others declare that the different aspects of God have different names, depending on the role God is playing, the context in which he is referred to and the specific aspects which are emphasized (see <a href="Negative_theology#In_the_Jewish_tradition" title="wikilink">Negative theology in Jewish thought</a>).</p>

<p>The most important and most often written name of <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> in <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a> is the <a href="Tetragrammaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetragrammaton</a>, the four-letter name of God. This name is first mentioned in the book of <a href="Genesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genesis</a> and is usually translated as 'the L<small>ORD</small>'. Because Judaism forbids pronouncing the name outside the Temple, the correct pronunciation of this name has been lost—the original <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> texts only included consonants. Some scholars conjecture that it was pronounced &quot;Yahweh&quot;, but some suggest that it never had a pronunciation (which is extremely unlikely given that it is found as an element in numerous Hebrew names). The <a href="Hebrew_alphabet" title="wikilink">Hebrew letters</a> are named <em>Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh</em>: &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;; note that Hebrew is written from right to left, rather than left to right as in English. In English it is written as YHWH, YHVH, or JHVH depending on the <a href="transliteration" class="uri" title="wikilink">transliteration</a> convention that is used. The Tetragrammaton was written in contrasting <a href="Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet" title="wikilink">Paleo-Hebrew</a> characters in some of the oldest surviving square <a href="Aramaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a> Hebrew texts, and it is speculated that it was, even at that period, read as <em>Adonai</em>, &quot;My Lord&quot;, when encountered.</p>
<p>In appearance, YHWH is the third person singular imperfect of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, meaning, therefore, &quot;He is&quot;. This explanation agrees with the meaning of the name given in <a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 3:14, where God is represented as speaking, and hence as using the first person &lt;U+2014&gt; &quot;I am.&quot; It stems from the Hebrew conception of <a href="monotheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">monotheism</a> that God exists by himself, the uncreated Creator who doesn't depend on anything or anyone else; therefore <em>I am who I am</em>.</p>
<p><img src="Tehilim_scroll.png" title="fig:Portion of column 19 of the Psalms Scroll (Tehilim) from Qumran Cave 11. The Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew can be clearly seen six times in this portion." alt="Portion of column 19 of the Psalms Scroll (Tehilim) from Qumran Cave 11. The Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew can be clearly seen six times in this portion." width="340" />The idea of 'life' has been traditionally connected with the name YHWH from medieval times. God is presented as a living God, as contrasted with the lifeless gods of the heathen: God is presented as the source and author of life (compare <a href="Books_of_Kings" title="wikilink">1 Kings</a> 18; <a href="Book_of_Isaiah" title="wikilink">Isaiah</a> 41:26–29, 44:6–20; <a href="Book_of_Jeremiah" title="wikilink">Jeremiah</a> 10:10, 14; <a href="Genesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genesis</a> 2:7; and so forth)</p>
<p>The name YHWH is often reconstructed as <em>Yahweh</em> or often times <em>Jehovah</em> in the English language. The name Yahweh is likely to be the origin of the <a href="Demiurge" title="wikilink">Yao</a> of <a href="Gnosticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gnosticism</a>. A few also think it might be cognate to <a href="Yaw_(god)" title="wikilink">Yaw</a> of <a href="Ugarit" title="wikilink">Ugaritic</a> texts. If the Hehs in the Tetragrammaton are seen as sacred augmentation similar to those in <em>Abraham</em> (from <em>Abram</em>) and <em>Sarah</em> (from <em>Sarai</em>), then the association becomes clearer. Though the final Heh in <em>Yahweh</em> would not necessarily have been pronounced in classical Hebrew, the medial Heh would have almost certainly been pronounced. Other possible vocalisations include a <a href="mappik" class="uri" title="wikilink">mappik</a> in the final Heh, rendering it pronounced — most likely with a gliding <em><a href="Patah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patah</a></em> (a-sound) before it.</p>
<p>The prohibition of blasphemy, for which capital punishment is prescribed in Jewish law, refers only to the <a href="Tetragrammaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetragrammaton</a> (Soferim iv., end; comp. Sanh. 66a).</p>

<p><img src="Tetragrammaton_scripts.png" title="fig:The Tetragrammaton in Phoenician (1100 BC to AD 300), Aramaic (10th Century BC to 0) and modern Hebrew scripts." alt="The Tetragrammaton in Phoenician (1100 BC to AD 300), Aramaic (10th Century BC to 0) and modern Hebrew scripts." />All modern denominations of <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a> teach that the four letter name of God, YHWH, is forbidden to be uttered except by the High Priest, in the Temple. Since the <a href="Temple_in_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Temple in Jerusalem</a> no longer exists, this name is never said in religious rituals by Jews. Orthodox and Conservative Jews never pronounce it for any reason. Some religious non-Orthodox Jews are willing to pronounce it, but for educational purposes only, and never in casual conversation or in prayer. Instead of pronouncing YHWH during <a href="prayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">prayer</a>, Jews say <em>Adonai</em>, though passages such as:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, YHWH [be] with you. And they answered him, YHWH bless thee&quot; (<a href="Book_of_Ruth" title="wikilink">Ruth</a> 2:4)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>strongly indicate that there was a time when the name was in common usage. Also the fact that many <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> names consist of verb forms <a href="contraction_(grammar)" title="wikilink">contracted</a> with the tetragrammaton indicates that the people knew the verbalization of the name in order to understand the connection. The prohibition against verbalizing the name never applied to the forms of the name within these contractions (<em>yeho-</em>, <em>yo-</em>, <em>-yahoo</em>, <em>-yah</em>) and their pronunciation remains known. (These known pronunciations do not in fact match the conjectured pronunciation <em>yahweh</em> for the stand alone form.)</p>
<p><a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> translations of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> generally render YHWH as &quot;Jehovah&quot; in several locations, while replacing the name altogether as &quot;the L<small>ORD</small>&quot; (in small capitals), and <em>Adonai</em> as &quot;Lord&quot; (in normal case). In a few cases, where &quot;Lord YHWH&quot; appears, the combination is written as &quot;Lord G<small>OD</small>&quot;.</p>

<h5 id="hashem">Hashem</h5>
<p><a href="Halakha" title="wikilink">Jewish law</a> requires that secondary rules be placed around the primary law, to reduce the chance that the main law will be broken. As such, it is common Jewish practice to restrict the use of the word <em>Adonai</em> to <a href="prayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">prayer</a> only. In conversation, many Jewish people will call God &quot;<em>Hashem</em>,&quot; which is Hebrew for &quot;the Name&quot; (this appears in <a href="Leviticus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leviticus</a> 24:11). Many Jews extend this prohibition to some of the other names listed below, and will add additional sounds to alter the pronunciation of a name when using it outside of a liturgical context, such as <strong>k</strong>el or elo<strong>k</strong>im.</p>
<p>While other names of God in Judaism are generally restricted to use in a <a href="Jewish_liturgy" title="wikilink">liturgical</a> context, <em>Hashem</em> is used in more casual circumstances. <em>Hashem</em> is used by Orthodox Jews so as to avoid saying <em>Adonai</em> outside of a ritual context. For example, when Orthodox Jews make <a href="Sound_recording_and_reproduction" title="wikilink">audio recordings</a> of prayer services, they generally substitute <em>Hashem</em> for <em>Adonai</em>.</p>

<h5 id="adoshem">Adoshem</h5>
<p>Up until the mid twentieth century, however, another convention was quite common, the use of the word, <em>Adoshem</em> - combining the first syllable of the word <em>Adonai</em> with the last syllable of the word <em>Hashem</em>. This convention was discouraged by Rabbi <a href="David_HaLevi_Segal" title="wikilink">David HaLevi Segal</a> (known as the Taz) in his commentary to the <a href="Shulchan_Aruch" title="wikilink">Shulchan Aruch</a>. However, it took a few centuries for the word to fall into almost complete disuse. The rationale behind the Taz's reasoning was that it is disrespectful to combine a Name of God with another word.</p>
<h3 id="other-names-of-god">Other names of God</h3>
<h4 id="adonai">Adonai</h4>
<p>Jews also call God Adonai, Hebrew for &quot;Lord&quot; (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05B2&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;). Formally, this is plural (&quot;my Lords&quot;), but the plural is usually construed as a respectful, and not a <a href="syntax" title="wikilink">syntactic</a> plural. (The singular form is <em>Adoni</em>: &quot;my lord&quot;. This was used by the Phoenicians for the pagan god <a href="Tammuz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tammuz</a> and is the origin of the Greek name <a href="Adonis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adonis</a>. Jews only use the singular to refer to a distinguished person.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, Adonai and other names of God may be written in the plural form to point out that this one God embodies all of the many gods that were worshipped by the ancestors of the Israelites and concurrently by the surrounding peoples.</p>
<p>Since pronouncing YHWH is considered sinful, Jews use <em>Adonai</em> instead in prayers, and colloquially would use <em>Hashem</em> (The Name). When the <a href="Masoretes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Masoretes</a> added vowel pointings to the text of the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a> in the <a href="1st_century" title="wikilink">first century CE</a>, they gave the word YHWH the vowels of <em>Adonai</em>, to remind the reader to say <em>Adonai</em> instead.</p>

<p>The Sephardi translators of the <a href="Ferrara_Bible" title="wikilink">Ferrara Bible</a> go further and susbtitute <em>Adonai</em> with <em>A.</em></p>
<h4 id="ehyeh-asher-ehyeh">Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh</h4>
<p>The name <em>Ehyeh</em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05B6&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05B6&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;) denotes God's potency in the immediate future, and is part of YHWH. The phrase <em>&quot;ehyeh-asher-ehyeh&quot;</em> (<a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 3:14) is interpreted by some authorities as &quot;I will be because I will be,&quot; using the second part as a gloss and referring to God's promise, &quot;Certainly I will be [ehyeh] with thee&quot; (Exodus 3:12). Other authorities claim that the whole phrase forms one name. The <a href="Targum_Onkelos" title="wikilink">Targum Onkelos</a> leaves the phrase untranslated and is so quoted in the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> (B. B. 73a). The &quot;I am that I am&quot; of the <a href="Authorized_Version" title="wikilink">Authorized Version</a> is based on this view.</p>
<p><em>I am that I am</em>' (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;, pronounced <strong>'Ehyeh asher ehyeh</strong>') is the sole response used in (Exodus 3:14) when <a href="Moses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moses</a> asked for God's name. It is one of the most famous verses in the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a>. <em>Hayah</em> means &quot;existed&quot; or &quot;was&quot; in <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>; <em>ehyeh</em> is the first-person singular imperfect form. <em>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</em> is generally interpreted to mean &quot;I will be what I will be&quot;, <em>I shall be what I shall be</em> or <em>I am that I am</em> (<a href="King_James_Bible" title="wikilink">King James Bible</a> and others). The <a href="Tetragrammaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetragrammaton</a> itself may derive from the same verbal root. </p>
<h4 id="el">El</h4>
<p><em>Main article: <a href="El_(god)" title="wikilink">El (god)</a></em></p>
<p>The word <em><a href="El_(god)" title="wikilink">El</a></em> appears in other northwest <a href="Semitic_languages" title="wikilink">Semitic languages</a> such as <a href="Phoenician_language" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> and <a href="Aramaic_language" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a>. In <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a>, <em>ilu</em> is the ordinary word for god. It is also found also in <a href="Old_South_Arabian" title="wikilink">Old South Arabian</a> and in <a href="Ge&#39;ez_language" title="wikilink">Ethiopic</a>, and, as in Hebrew, it is often used as an element in proper names. In northwest Semitic texts it often appears to be used of one single god, perhaps the head of the pantheon, sometimes specifically said to be the creator.</p>
<p><em>El</em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;) is used in both the singular and plural, both for other gods and for the God of Israel. As a name of God, however, it is used chiefly in poetry and prophetic discourse, rarely in prose, and then usually with some epithet attached, as &quot;a jealous God.&quot; Other examples of its use with some attribute or epithet are: <em>El <a href="`Elyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">`Elyon</a></em> (&quot;Most High God&quot;), <em>El Shaddai</em> (&quot;God Almighty&quot;), <em>El `Olam</em> (&quot;Everlasting God&quot;), <em>El Hai</em> (&quot;Living God&quot;), <em>El Ro'i</em> (&quot;God of Seeing&quot;), <em>El Elohe Israel</em> (&quot;God, the God of Israel&quot;), <em>El Gibbor</em> (&quot;God of Strength&quot;). In addition, names such as <a href="Gabriel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gabriel</a>(&quot;Strength of God&quot;), <a href="Michael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michael</a> (&quot;He Who is Like God&quot;), <a href="Raphael" class="uri" title="wikilink">Raphael</a> (&quot;God's medicine&quot;) and <a href="Daniel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daniel</a> (&quot;God is My Judge&quot;) use God's name in a similar fashion. </p>
<h4 id="elohim">Elohim</h4>
<p><em>Main article: <a href="Elohim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elohim</a></em></p>
<p>A common name of God in the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a> is <em><a href="Elohim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elohim</a></em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;); as opposed to other names mentioned in this article, this name also describes gods of other religions.</p>
<p>Despite the <em>-im</em> ending common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word <em>Elohim</em>, when referring to God is grammatically singular, and regularly takes a singular verb in the Hebrew Bible. It is argued that the word <em>elohim</em> had an origin in a plural grammatical form. When the Hebrew Bible uses <em>elohim</em> not in reference to God, it usually takes plural forms of the verb (for example, <a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 20:3). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example <em><a href="Behemoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Behemoth</a></em>. In <a href="Modern_Hebrew" title="wikilink">Modern Hebrew</a>, the singular word <em>be'alim</em> (&quot;owner&quot;) looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.</p>
<p>Other scholars interpret the <em>-im</em> ending as an expression of majesty (<em>pluralis majestatis</em>) or excellence (<em>pluralis excellentiae</em>), expressing high dignity or greatness: compare with the similar use of plurals of <em>ba`al</em> (master) and <em>adon</em> (lord). For these reasons many <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christians</a> cite the apparent plurality of <em>elohim</em> as evidence for the basic Christian doctrine of the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a>. This was a traditional position but modern Christian <a href="theology" title="wikilink">theologians</a> now largely accept that this is an exegetical fallacy.</p>
<p>Theologians who dispute this claim, cite the hypothesis that plurals of majesty came about in more modern times. <a href="Richard_Toporoski" title="wikilink">Richard Toporoski</a>, a classics scholar, asserts that plurals of majesty first appeared in the reign of <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> (284-305 CE)<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, <a href="Gesenius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gesenius</a> states in his book <em>Hebrew Grammar</em> <sup>2</sup> the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish grammarians call such plurals &lt;U+2026&gt; <em>plur. virium</em> or <em>virtutum</em>; later grammarians call them <em>plur. excellentiae</em>, <em>magnitudinis</em>, or <em>plur. maiestaticus</em>. This last name may have been suggested by the <em>we</em> used by kings when speaking of themselves (compare <a href="1_Maccabees" title="wikilink">1 Maccabees</a> 10:19 and 11:31); and the plural used by God in <a href="Book_of_Genesis" title="wikilink">Genesis</a> 1:26 and 11:7; <a href="Book_of_Isaiah" title="wikilink">Isaiah</a> 6:8 has been incorrectly explained in this way). It is, however, either <em>communicative</em> (including the attendant <a href="angels" class="uri" title="wikilink">angels</a>: so at all events in Isaiah 6:8 and Genesis 3:22), or according to others, an indication of <em>the fullness of power and might</em> implied. It is best explained as a plural of <em>self-deliberation</em>. The use of the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to Hebrew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plural form ending in <em>-im</em> can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words <em>chayyim</em>: &quot;life&quot; or <em>betulim</em>: &quot;virginity&quot;. If understood this way <em>Elohim</em> means &quot;divinity&quot; or &quot;deity&quot;. The word <em>chayyim</em> is similarly syntactically singular when used as a name but syntactically plural otherwise.</p>
<p>The Hebrew form <em>Eloah</em> (&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;, which looks as though it might be a singular form of <em>Elohim</em>) is comparatively rare, occurring only in poetry and late prose (in the <a href="Book_of_Job" title="wikilink">Book of Job</a>, 41 times). What is probably the same divine name is found in <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> (<em>Ilah</em> as singular &quot;a god&quot;, as opposed to <em>Allah</em> meaning &quot;The God&quot; or &quot;God&quot;) and in <a href="Aramaic_language" title="wikilink">Aramaic</a> (<em>Elaha</em>). This unusual singular form is used in six places for heathen deities (examples: <a href="Books_of_Chronicles" title="wikilink">2 Chronicles</a> 32:15; <a href="Book_of_Daniel" title="wikilink">Daniel</a> 11:37, 38;). The normal <em>Elohim</em> form is also used in the plural a few times, either for gods or images (<a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 9:1, 12:12, 20:3; and so forth) or for one god (<a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 32:1; <a href="Genesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genesis</a> 31:30, 32; and elsewhere). In the great majority of cases both are used as names of the one God of Israel.</p>
<p>The root-meaning of the word is unknown. One theory is that it may be connected with the old Arabic verb <em>alih</em> (to be perplexed, afraid; to seek refuge because of fear). <em>Eloah</em>, <em>Elohim</em>, would, therefore, be &quot;He who is the object of fear or reverence,&quot; or &quot;He with whom one who is afraid takes refuge.&quot;</p>
<p>In many of the passages in which <em>Elohim</em> occurs in the Bible it refers to non-Israelite deities, or in some instances to powerful men or judges (Exodus 21:6). </p>

<h4 id="elyon">`Elyon</h4>
<p><em>Main article: <a href="Elyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elyon</a></em></p>
<p>The name <em>`Elyon</em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt;) occurs in combination with <em>El</em>, YHWH or <em>Elohim</em>, and also alone. It appears chiefly in poetic and later Biblical passages. The modern Hebrew adjective &quot;`Elyon&quot; means &quot;supreme&quot; (as in &quot;Supreme Court&quot;) or &quot;Most High&quot;. <em>El Elyon</em> has been traditionally translated into English as 'God Most High'. The <a href="Phoenicians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenicians</a> used what appears to be a similar name for God, &lt;U+0388&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;. It is cognate to the Arabic <em>`Aliyy</em>. </p>
<h4 id="shaddai">Shaddai</h4>
<p>The name <em>Shaddai</em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05B7&gt;&lt;U+05C1&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05B7&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;), which occurs both independently and in combination with <em>El</em>, is used as a name of God chiefly in the <a href="Book_of_Job" title="wikilink">Book of Job</a>. According to Exodus 6:2, 3, this is the name by which God was known to <a href="Abraham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abraham</a>, <a href="Isaac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isaac</a>, and <a href="Jacob" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jacob</a>. In the <a href="Septuagint" class="uri" title="wikilink">Septuagint</a> and other early translation it was translated with words meaning 'Almighty'.</p>
<p>The root word &quot;shadad&quot; (&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;) means &quot;to overpower&quot; or &quot;to destroy&quot;. This would give Shaddai the meaning of &quot;destroyer&quot; as one of the aspects of God. Compare to &quot;<a href="Shiva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shiva</a>,&quot; the destroyer in the Hindu trinity, &quot;creator, preserver, destroyer&quot;.</p>
<p>Another theory is that 'Shaddai' is a derivation of a <a href="Semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> stem that appears in the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> <em>shad&lt;U+00FB&gt;</em>, 'mountain', and <em>shadd&lt;U+0101&gt;`&lt;U+00FB&gt;</em> or <em>shadd&lt;U+00FB&gt;`a</em>, 'mountain-dweller'. This theory was popularized by <a href="William_Foxwell_Albright" title="wikilink">W. F. Albright</a> but was somewhat weakened when it was noticed that the doubling of the medial <em>d</em> is first documented only in the <a href="Neo-Assyrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neo-Assyrian</a> period. However, the doubling in Hebrew might possibly be secondary. In this theory God is seen as inhabiting a mythical holy mountain: a concept not unknown in ancient near eastern mythology (see <a href="El" class="uri" title="wikilink">El</a>), and also evident in the <a href="Syriac_language" title="wikilink">Syriac</a> Christian writings of <a href="Ephrem_the_Syrian" title="wikilink">Ephrem the Syrian</a>, who places <a href="Garden_of_Eden" title="wikilink">Eden</a> on an inaccessible mountaintop.</p>
<p>An alternative view proposed by Albright is that the name is connected to <em>shadayim</em> which means breasts in Hebrew. It may thus be connected to the notion of God&lt;U+2019&gt;s fertility and blessings of the human race. In several instances it is connected with fruitfulness: &lt;U+201C&gt;May God Almighty [El Shaddai] bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers . . .&lt;U+201D&gt; (Gen. 28:3). &lt;U+201C&gt;I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]: be fruitful and increase in number&lt;U+201D&gt; (Gen. 35:11). &lt;U+201C&gt;By the Almighty [El Shaddai] who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts [shadayim] and of the womb [racham] &lt;U+201D&gt; (Gen. 49:25).</p>
<p>It is also given a <a href="Midrash" title="wikilink">Midrashic</a> interpretation as an acronym standing for 'Guardian of the Doors of Israel' (Hebrew: <strong>&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05C1&gt;</strong>&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05B6&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; <strong>&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;</strong>&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; <strong>&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;</strong>&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05C2&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05B6&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;), which is commonly found as carvings or writings upon the <a href="Mezuzah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mezuzah</a>, a vessel which houses a scroll of parchment with Biblical text written on it, that is situated upon all the doorframes in a home or establishment.</p>
<p><em>Shaddai</em> was also a late Bronze age, <em>Amorite</em> city on the banks of the <a href="Euphrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euphrates</a> river, in northern <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>. The site of its ruin-mound is called <em>Tell eth-Thadyen</em>: &quot;Thadyen&quot; being the modern <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> rendering of the original West <a href="Semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> &quot;Shaddai.&quot; It has been conjectured that <em>El Shaddai</em> was therefore the &quot;god of Shaddai&quot; and associated in tradition with <a href="Abraham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abraham</a>, and the inclusion of the Abraham stories into the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a> may have brought the northern name with them. (See <a href="Documentary_hypothesis" title="wikilink">Documentary hypothesis</a>.) </p>
<h4 id="shalom">Shalom</h4>
<p><em><a href="Shalom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shalom</a></em> (&quot;Peace&quot;; Hebrew: &lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;)</p>
<p>The <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> says &quot;the name of God is 'Peace'&quot; (<em>Pere&lt;U+1E33&gt; ha-Shalom</em>, Shab. 10b), (<a href="Book_of_Judges" title="wikilink">Judges</a> 6:23); consequently, one is not permitted to greet another with the word <em>shalom</em> in unholy places such as a bathroom (<a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a>, <em>Shabbat</em>, 10b). The name <em>Sh'lomo</em> literally His peace (from <em>shalom</em>, <a href="Solomon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solomon</a>, &lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;) refers to the God of Peace. Shalom in Hebrew also can mean &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye.&quot; </p>
<h4 id="shekhinah">Shekhinah</h4>
<p><em><a href="Shekhinah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shekhinah</a></em> (Hebrew: &lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;) is the presence or manifestation of God which has descended to &quot;dwell&quot; among humanity. The term never appears in the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a>; later rabbis used the word when speaking of God dwelling either in the <a href="Tabernacle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabernacle</a> or amongst the people of Israel. The root of the word means &quot;dwelling&quot;. Of the principal names of God, it is the only one that is of the feminine gender in Hebrew grammar. </p>
<h4 id="yah">Yah</h4>
<p>The name <em>Yah</em> is composed of the first letters of YHWH. The <a href="Rasta" title="wikilink">Rastafarian</a> <a href="Jah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jah</a> is derived from this. </p>
<h4 id="yhwh-tzevaotsabaoth">YHWH Tzevaot/Sabaoth</h4>
<p>The names <em>YHWH</em> and <em>Elohim</em> frequently occur with the word <em>tzevaot</em> or <em>sabaoth</em> (&quot;hosts&quot; or &quot;armies&quot;, Hebrew: &lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;) as <em>YHWH Elohe Tzevaot</em> (&quot;YHWH God of Hosts&quot;), <em>Elohe Tzevaot</em> (&quot;God of Hosts&quot;), <em>Adonai YHWH Tzevaot</em> (&quot;Lord YHWH of Hosts&quot;) or, most frequently, <em>YHWH Tzevaot</em> (&quot;YHVH of Hosts&quot;). This name is traditionally transliterated in Latin as <em>Sabaoth</em>, a form that will be more familiar to many English readers, as it was used in the <a href="King_James_Version" title="wikilink">King James Version</a> of the Bible.</p>
<p>This compound divine name occurs chiefly in the prophetic literature and does not appear at all in the <a href="Pentateuch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pentateuch</a>, <a href="Book_of_Joshua" title="wikilink">Joshua</a> or <a href="Book_of_Judges" title="wikilink">Judges</a>. The original meaning of <em>tzevaot</em> may be found in <a href="Books_of_Samuel" title="wikilink">1 Samuel</a> 17:45, where it is interpreted as denoting &quot;the God of the armies of Israel&quot;. The word, apart from this special use, always means armies or hosts of men, as, for example, in <a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 6:26, 7:4, 12:41, while the singular is used to designate the heavenly host.</p>
<p>The Latin spelling <em>Sabaoth</em> combined with the large, golden vine motif over the door on the Herodian Temple (built by the Jewish <a href="Herod_the_Great" title="wikilink">Herod the Great</a>) led to identification by <a href="Roman_religion" title="wikilink">Romans</a> with the god <a href="Sabazius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabazius</a>. </p>
<p>The name <em>Sabaoth</em> is also associated with a demi-god in the gnostic scriptures of the Nag Hammadi Text; he is the son of Yaltabaoth.</p>

<p>In the <a href="Haggadah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haggadah</a> (the traditional Hebrew <a href="Passover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Passover</a> text) it is written that the divine names of God could be used to perform miracles if one knew their combination.</p>
<h3 id="kabbalistic-use">Kabbalistic use</h3>
<p><img src="Sevent-two-letter-name.jpg" title="fig:The seventy-two names" alt="The seventy-two names" />The system of cosmology of the <a href="Kabbalah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabbalah</a> explains the significance of the names. One of the most important names is that of the En Sof &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E3&gt; (&quot;Infinite&quot; or &quot;Endless&quot;), who is above the <a href="Sefirot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sefirot</a>.</p>
<p>The forty-two-lettered name contains the combined names &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt; &lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;, that when spelled in letters it contains <a href="42_(number)" title="wikilink">42</a> letters. The equivalent in value of YHWH (spelled &lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt; &lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt; &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt; = 45) is the forty-five-lettered name.</p>
<p>The seventy-two-lettered name is based from three verses in <a href="Exodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> 14:19-21) beginning with &quot;Vayyissa,&quot; &quot;Vayyabo,&quot; &quot;Vayyet,&quot; respectively. Each of the verses contains 72 letters, and when combined they form 72 names.</p>
<p>The <a href="Kabbalah" title="wikilink">kabbalistic</a> book <a href="Sefer_Yetzirah" title="wikilink">Sefer Yetzirah</a>, explains that the creation of the world was achieved by the manipulation of the sacred letters that form the names of God. Much in the same way, a <a href="golem" class="uri" title="wikilink">golem</a> is created using all permutations of God's name.</p>
<h2 id="laws-of-writing-divine-names">Laws of writing divine names</h2>
<p><img src="Polyglot_Psalter.png" title="fig:200|The Psalms in Hebrew and Latin. Manuscript on parchment, 12th century." alt="200|The Psalms in Hebrew and Latin. Manuscript on parchment, 12th century." />According to Jewish tradition, the sacredness of the divine names must be recognized by the professional scribe who writes the Scriptures, or the chapters for the <a href="tefillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">tefillin</a> and the <a href="mezuzah" class="uri" title="wikilink">mezuzah</a>. Before transcribing any of the divine names he prepares mentally to sanctify them. Once he begins a name he does not stop until it is finished, and he must not be interrupted while writing it, even to greet a king. If an error is made in writing it, it may not be erased, but a line must be drawn round it to show that it is canceled, and the whole page must be put in a <a href="genizah" class="uri" title="wikilink">genizah</a> (burial place for scripture) and a new page begun.</p>
<h3 id="the-tradition-of-seven-divine-names">The tradition of seven divine names</h3>
<p>According to Jewish tradition, the number of divine names that require the scribe's special care is seven: <em>El</em>, <em>Elohim</em>, <em>Adonai</em>, <em>YHWH</em>, <em>Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh</em>, <em>Shaddai</em>, and <em>Tzevaot</em>.</p>
<p>However, Rabbi Jose considered <em>Tzevaot</em> a common name (Soferim 4:1; Yer. R. H. 1:1; Ab. R. N. 34). Rabbi Ishmael held that even <em>Elohim</em> is common (Sanh. 66a). All other names, such as 'Merciful', 'Gracious', and 'Faithful', merely represent attributes that are common also to human beings (Sheb. 35a).</p>
<p>Many Jews do not actually ever write God's name on paper or say it, this is to sanctify his name and not to come to desecrate God&lt;U+2019&gt;s name. In many Jewish communities one would say Hashem instead of God's name. It has been the tradition of many Jews including <a href="Chabad-Lubavitch" title="wikilink">Chabad</a> to write G&lt;U+2013&gt;d or L&lt;U+2013&gt;rd instead of actually spelling the name out, as can be seen on their <a href="http://www.chabad.org">official website Chabad.org</a>.</p>
