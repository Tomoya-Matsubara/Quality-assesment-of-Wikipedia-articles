<p>The <strong>April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak</strong> was a major <a href="tornado_outbreak" title="wikilink">tornado outbreak</a> in the <a href="Central_United_States" title="wikilink">Central</a> and parts of the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">Southern United States</a> that began on April 6, 2006 in the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> and continued until April 8 in <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>, with most of the activity on April 7. The hardest-hit area was <a href="Middle_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Middle Tennessee</a> where several strong tornadoes devastated entire neighborhoods and left nine people dead. The worst damage took place in <a href="Gallatin,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>. Other communities north of <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> were also hard hit.</p>
<p>There were 73 tornadoes confirmed across 13 states, with the bulk of them coming on the afternoon and evening of April 7 across the South, particularly in <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>. In total, 13 deaths were reported as a result of the severe weather (12 of them in Tennessee) and over $1.5 billion in damage was reported,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of which over $630 million was in Middle Tennessee.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was the third major outbreak of 2006, hot on the heels of <a href="April_2,_2006_Tornado_Outbreak" title="wikilink">a major outbreak</a> on April 2. It was also considered to be the worst disaster event in Middle Tennessee since the <a href="1998_Nashville_tornado_outbreak" title="wikilink">Nashville tornado outbreak</a> on April 16, 1998.</p>

<p><img src="SPC_severe_outlook_04072006.png" title="fig:Probabilistic maps issued by the Storm Prediction Center during the heart of the outbreak." alt="Probabilistic maps issued by the Storm Prediction Center during the heart of the outbreak." />The outbreak took place as a result of a powerful <a href="Low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">low pressure system</a> over the <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwest</a> that produced a strong <a href="cold_front" title="wikilink">cold front</a> which tracked eastward across the South. The dry, cold air behind the cold front combined with warm, humid air from the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> to allow severe thunderstorms to form, particularly on April 7.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Storm_Prediction_Center" title="wikilink">Storm Prediction Center</a> issued a high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and April 7 in the areas likely to be affected. Conditions were favorable for an extremely strong tornado outbreak on both days.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Activity was not as great as expected on April 6, with only 12 tornadoes confirmed, mostly in <a href="Kansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kansas</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Several of the tornadoes were damaging, but no fatalities and only a few injuries were reported. The reason for the relatively modest activity was due to the more stable than expected air mass that day over the region, with lower <a href="dewpoint" title="wikilink">dewpoints</a> and less <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a> despite the absence of a cap which would have otherwise allowed a massive outbreak.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Conditions changed on April 7 in the South as the system moved eastward, with the cold front entering a more conducive environment. The increased <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a>, combined with the high heat and <a href="humidity" class="uri" title="wikilink">humidity</a>, allowed tornadoes to begin forming in the late morning, continuing throughout the afternoon, evening, and even into the overnight hours. By the end of the day, a total of 48 tornadoes had been reported, several of which caused significant damage and loss of life. The most violent tornadoes hit in <a href="Middle_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Middle Tennessee</a>, where 12 people were killed.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In addition to the tornadoes, there were many reports of <a href="hail" class="uri" title="wikilink">hail</a> as large as <a href="softball" title="wikilink">softballs</a>, powerful <a href="microburst" title="wikilink">microbursts</a> and straight-line winds, as well as local <a href="Flash_flood" title="wikilink">flooding</a>. Extensive damage was also reported in the northern suburbs of <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a> as the storms reached that area overnight into the early morning of April 8.</p>
<p>Despite a lower risk of activity on April 8, the severe weather continued in <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a>, <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> and <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> (mostly in the early morning hours) with another 13 tornadoes reported before the outbreak finally ended as the system moved offshore into the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Over the three day period, 73 tornadoes were confirmed.</p>

This tornado would kill nine people in the surrounding neighborhoods, though only minor injuries were reported at the college." alt="Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee. This tornado would kill nine people in the surrounding neighborhoods, though only minor injuries were reported at the college." /> The most destructive supercell of the outbreak developed just northwest of <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> at about 1:30 pm CDT (1830 UTC) on April 7 in <a href="Dickson_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Dickson County</a>. It would then track across the northern suburbs of Nashville through <a href="Cheatham_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Cheatham</a>, <a href="Davidson_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Davidson</a>, and <a href="Sumner_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Sumner</a> counties, killing nine people and damaging or destroying an estimated 1,000 homes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The first tornado touched down near <a href="Charlotte,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Charlotte</a> at 1:30 pm CDT (1830 UTC). That tornado was a rated as a strong <strong>F3</strong>. Severe and extensive damage was reported in that area as well as in <a href="Greenbrier,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Greenbrier</a>. At least 12 houses, including several mobile homes, were destroyed. In addition at least 50 other houses were damaged, most of which sustained heavy damage. The tornado tracked towards <a href="Ashland_City,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Ashland City</a> inflicting more significant damage, including numerous houses and businesses. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down. The worst impact was felt at Centennial Medical Center's Ashland City <a href="hospital" class="uri" title="wikilink">hospital</a> site, which was damaged and lost its <a href="heating" class="uri" title="wikilink">heating</a> and <a href="air_conditioning" title="wikilink">air conditioning</a> system, forcing several patients to be transferred to Nashville hospitals. No injuries were reported there.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Gallatintornado4.jpg" title="fig:Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" alt="Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" />The supercell then tracked into Davidson County and the northernmost part of Nashville. It was initially reported that new tornado touched down at about 2:00 p.m. CDT (1900 UTC) in <a href="Whites_Creek" title="wikilink">Whites Creek</a>, a largely rural area with light-scale development along <a href="U.S._Route_431" title="wikilink">US 431</a> near Old Hickory Boulevard. Damage was reported along a path stretching out to <a href="Interstate_24" title="wikilink">I-24</a> near Exit 40. The <a href="Tennessee_Emergency_Management_Agency" title="wikilink">Tennessee Emergency Management Agency</a> reported that 15 houses and 10 other buildings were destroyed in the area, about  north of the urban part of Nashville.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> However, that tornado was never confirmed; it was likely straight-line wind damage.</p>
<p>The supercell then tracked into <a href="Goodlettsville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Goodlettsville</a> where another tornado touched down, striking the suburban area at around 2:15 pm CDT (1915 UTC) with considerable force. It hit a residential subdivision in the center of town, with considerable damage reported at <a href="City_Hall" title="wikilink">City Hall</a>, Two local <a href="churches" class="uri" title="wikilink">churches</a>(Bakers Chapel <a href="CME_Church" title="wikilink">CME Church</a> and Metro Baptist Church), and to numerous houses, some of which were demolished. In total, 25 homes were destroyed in Goodlettsville and another 44 homes or businesses were damaged. The tornado then heavily damaged a busy commercial area along <a href="Tennessee_State_Highway_174" title="wikilink">Long Hollow Pike</a>, blowing the roofs off of several buildings and heavily damaging others. It also caused severe damage to the <a href="electricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">electricity</a> network in the area, which was out for several days in some subdivisions in <a href="Goodlettsville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Goodlettsville</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The tornado also caused a traffic nightmare as a direct result of tornado-related accidents on <a href="Interstate_65" title="wikilink">I-65</a> at Exit 97 just before <a href="rush_hour" title="wikilink">rush hour</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> No deaths were reported in <a href="Goodlettsville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Goodlettsville</a> although seven injuries were reported, and public shelters were set up at two locations.</p>
<p><img src="Gallatintornado5.jpg" title="fig:Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" alt="Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" />The tornado continued into <a href="Sumner_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Sumner County</a> just north of <a href="Hendersonville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Hendersonville</a>. It damaged numerous houses in that area before entering and devastating <a href="Gallatin,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Gallatin</a> with <strong>F3</strong> damage at about 2:30 pm CDT (1930 UTC). Several entire subdivisions, primarily along the north shore of <a href="Old_Hickory_Lake" title="wikilink">Old Hickory Lake</a>, were destroyed or flattened, killing nine people and injuring 121.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Three of the deaths were on the southwest end of Gallatin near Old Hickory Lake, and the other six were in the area of <a href="Tennessee_State_Highway_109" title="wikilink">South Water Avenue</a>. Over 700 houses were damaged or destroyed, including about 80 in Hendersonville. The Woodhaven subdivision of Gallatin was later discovered to have been poorly constructed (considering the value of the homes), with boards nailed to the <a href="cinder_block" title="wikilink">cinder blocks</a> at the base of the foundation.</p>
<p><a href="Volunteer_State_Community_College" title="wikilink">Volunteer State Community College</a> suffered extensive damage to numerous buildings, briefly trapping many students before they were rescued with only a few minor injuries. The front lawn of the college was littered with debris from buildings after the tornado. The public relations director for the college, Angie Jowers, stated that having routine tornado drills paid off that day, as no one was killed on the campus. A commercial area was also hit hard, along with three large <a href="car_dealership" title="wikilink">car dealerships</a> near Vol State, which saw hundreds of cars destroyed.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Damage to the campus was estimated at $56 million.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><img src="Gallatintornado6.jpg" title="fig:Damage to a storefront in Gallatin, Tennessee" alt="Damage to a storefront in Gallatin, Tennessee" /></p>
<p><a href="Station_Camp_High_School" title="wikilink">Station Camp High School</a>, a local high school, also received notable damage from this storm. The tornado affected its large athletic complex, tearing parts of the roof off and flooding the gymnasium. Damage was also sustained to student and faculty vehicles.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The tornado lifted shortly thereafter, however the supercell continued eastward and <a href="tornado_warning" title="wikilink">tornado warnings</a> were issues east of Gallatin as well. Total damage from the supercell tornadoes was estimated at over $650 million.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Coincidentally, the outbreak also cut short the first of a two-day emergency preparedness drill to be held on April 7 and 8 in four Middle Tennessee counties: <a href="Davidson_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Davidson</a>, <a href="Williamson_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Williamson</a>, <a href="Sumner_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Sumner</a>, and <a href="Wilson_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Wilson</a>. The second day was canceled.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="warren-county-tornadoes">Warren County tornadoes</h3>
<p><img src="Post.jpg" title="fig:National Weather Service post storm survey" alt="National Weather Service post storm survey" />Two tornado touchdowns were confirmed in <a href="Warren_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Warren County, Tennessee</a>, killing three people and injuring 15.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The first tornado, an <strong>F1</strong> moved across northern Warren County from about 4:45 pm CDT to 5:00 pm CDT.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> It touched down along Lance Road, near Blue Hill Road, where large trees were snapped, uprooted, and blown down. There was also major damage to a large barn, and shingles were pulled from a roof. This tornado continued along a path due east where it crossed the intersection of <a href="Tennessee_State_Route_56" title="wikilink">TN-56</a> and <a href="Tennessee_State_Route_287" title="wikilink">TN-287</a>, causing additional damage along this path.

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p><img src="Gallatintornado3.jpg" title="fig:Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" alt="Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee" />On the night after the tornado hit Gallatin, there were many reports of <a href="looting" class="uri" title="wikilink">looting</a> in the devastated community. A nightly <a href="curfew" class="uri" title="wikilink">curfew</a> was required to combat the looting and maintain order in the community. There were a total of 23 arrests made. The <a href="United_States_National_Guard" title="wikilink">United States National Guard</a> was called in after the tornado hit to help with security and the removal of the excessive debris. It would take 10 days for Volunteer State Community College to re-open after the tornado hit.</p>
<p>The City of Hendersonville did not have <a href="tornado_siren" title="wikilink">tornado sirens</a> at the time of the tornado, but the city installed some soon after the storm.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 26, the <a href="Greater_Nashville_Regional_Council" title="wikilink">Greater Nashville Regional Council</a> awarded the authorities involved in the recovery (including the municipalities of Sumner County) the Marshall S. Stuart Memorial Award for outstanding intergovernmental cooperation after the tornado. The quick response by other local authorities, counties and cities was congratulated.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In early October 2006, an episode of <em><a href="Extreme_Makeover:_Home_Edition" title="wikilink">Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</a></em> featured a family from Hendersonville that had their home being rebuilt after it was destroyed by the tornado.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, insurance issues plus personal injuries held back the recovery for many, and some neighborhoods have been slow to recover. Nonetheless, many homes have been rebuilt in the area.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
