<p><strong>7 World Trade Center</strong> is a building in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> located across from the <a href="World_Trade_Center_site" title="wikilink">World Trade Center site</a> in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a>. The name &quot;7 World Trade Center&quot; has referred to two buildings: the original structure, completed in 1987, and the current structure. The original building was destroyed on <a href="Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Collapse_of_7_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001</a> and replaced with the new 7 World Trade Center, which opened in 2006. Both buildings were developed by <a href="Larry_Silverstein" title="wikilink">Larry Silverstein</a>, who holds a <a href="ground_rent" title="wikilink">ground lease</a> for the site from the <a href="Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>The original 7 World Trade Center was 47 stories tall, clad in red exterior masonry, and occupied a <a href="trapezoid" title="wikilink">trapezoidal</a> footprint. An elevated walkway connected the building to the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> plaza. The building was situated above a <a href="Consolidated_Edison" title="wikilink">Consolidated Edison</a> (Con Ed) power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. In 1988, <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a> signed a long-term lease, and became the main tenants of the building. On <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, 7 WTC was damaged by <a href="debris" class="uri" title="wikilink">debris</a> when the nearby North Tower of the <a href="collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">WTC collapsed</a>. Its structural integrity was further compromised by fires that burned throughout the afternoon and the building collapsed completely at 5:20 p.m. Investigators are currently trying to determine exactly how the combination of local structural damage and fire caused the collapse of the whole structure. A final report is expected in or after July 2008.</p>
<p>The new 7 World Trade Center construction began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. It is 52 stories tall and still situated above the aforementioned power substation. Built on a smaller footprint than the original to allow <a href="Greenwich_Street,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Greenwich Street</a> to be restored from <a href="TriBeCa" class="uri" title="wikilink">TriBeCa</a> through the World Trade Center site and south to <a href="Battery_Park" title="wikilink">Battery Park</a>, the new building is bounded by <a href="Greenwich_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>, <a href="Vesey_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Vesey</a>, <a href="Washington_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, and <a href="Barclay_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Barclay</a> streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current 7 World Trade Center's design placed emphasis on safety, with a <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a> core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns, and incorporates numerous <a href="environmentally_friendly" title="wikilink">environmentally friendly</a> features.</p>

<p>The original 7 World Trade Center was a 47-story building, designed by <a href="Emery_Roth" title="wikilink">Emery Roth &amp; Sons</a>, with a red <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a> <a href="fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade" class="uri" title="wikilink">fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade</a>. The building was 610 feet (186 m) tall, with a <a href="trapezoid" title="wikilink">trapezoidal</a> footprint that was 330 ft (101 m) long and 140 ft (43 m) wide.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Tishman_Realty_&amp;_Construction" title="wikilink">Tishman Realty &amp; Construction</a> managed construction of the building, which began in 1983.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In March 1987, the building opened, becoming the seventh structure of the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>.</p>
<p>The building was constructed above a <a href="Consolidated_Edison" title="wikilink">Con Edison</a> <a href="electrical_substation" title="wikilink">substation</a> that had been on the site since 1967.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The substation had a <a href="caisson_(engineering)" title="wikilink">caisson</a> foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25 stories containing 600,000 sq ft (55,700 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The final design for 7 World Trade Center was for a much larger building covering a larger footprint than originally planned when the substation was built.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The structural design of 7 World Trade Center included features to allow a larger building than originally planned to be constructed. A system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders was located between floors 5 and 7 to transfer loads to the smaller foundation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The fifth floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the seventh floor, the building's structure was a typical tube-frame design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>A shipping/receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7 World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the third floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The spray-on <a href="fireproofing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fireproofing</a> for structural steel elements was <a href="gypsum" class="uri" title="wikilink">gypsum</a>-based <a href="Monokote" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monokote</a> which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and truss, and a three-hour rating for columns.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven, including 12 <a href="transformer" title="wikilink">transformers</a> on the fifth floor. Several generators in the building were used by the Office of Emergency Management, Salomon Smith Barney and others.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Storage tanks contained 24,000 gallons (91,000 L) of <a href="diesel" class="uri" title="wikilink">diesel</a> fuel to supply the generators.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Fuel oil distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> After the <a href="World_Trade_Center_1993_bombings" title="wikilink">World Trade Center bombings</a> of <a href="February_26" title="wikilink">February 26</a>, <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>, New York City mayor <a href="Rudy_Giuliani#Preparedness" title="wikilink">Rudy Giuliani</a> decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7 World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized in light of the events of <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">9/11</a>, the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Each floor had 47,000 sq ft (4,366 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of rentable office space which made the building's floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the City.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In all, 7 World Trade Center had 1,868,000 sq ft (174,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of office space.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Two pedestrian bridges connected the main World Trade Center complex, across Vesey Street, to the third floor of 7 World Trade Center.

<p>In June 1986, before construction was completed, Silverstein signed <a href="Drexel_Burnham_Lambert" title="wikilink">Drexel Burnham Lambert</a> as a tenant to lease the entire 7 World Trade Center building for $3 billion over a term of 30 years.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In December 1986, after the <a href="Ivan_Boesky" title="wikilink">Boesky</a> <a href="insider_trading" title="wikilink">insider-trading</a> scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Spicer &amp; Oppenheim agreed to lease 14 percent of the space, but for more than a year, as <a href="Black_Monday_(1987)" title="wikilink">Black Monday</a> and other factors adversely affected the <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a> real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, Silverstein had lowered the rent and made other concessions.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1988, <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a> withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at <a href="Columbus_Circle" title="wikilink">Columbus Circle</a> in <a href="Midtown_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Midtown</a> and agreed to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7 World Trade Center.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate the needs of Salomon Brothers.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Most of three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors, and more than 350 tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. &quot;Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building - and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation,&quot; said a district manager of <a href="Silverstein_Properties" title="wikilink">Silverstein Properties</a>. The unusual task was possible, said <a href="Larry_Silverstein" title="wikilink">Larry Silverstein</a>, because it was designed to allow for &quot;entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building's structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>As the North Tower collapsed on <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, debris hit 7 World Trade Center, causing heavy damage to the south face of the building.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The bottom portion of the building's south face was heavily damaged by debris, including damage to the southwest corner from the 8th to 18th floors, a large vertical gash on the center-bottom extending at least ten floors, and other damage as high as the 18th floor.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The building was equipped with a <a href="Fire_sprinkler_system" title="wikilink">sprinkler system</a>, but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the <a href="fire_pump" title="wikilink">fire pump</a> to deliver water. Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>In May 2002, the <a href="Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" title="wikilink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the <a href="American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> under leadership of Dr. <a href="W._Gene_Corley" title="wikilink">W. Gene Corley</a>, P.E. FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. According to FEMA, structural elements were exposed to high temperatures for a sufficient period of time to reduce their strength to the point of collapse<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>; nevertheless, it has since been determined that the fires burned out in 20 minutes at any given location.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The report did not reach final conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loss of structural integrity was likely a result of weakening caused by fires on the 5th to 7th floors. The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence. Further research, investigation, and analyses are needed to resolve this issue. [Ch. 5, p. 31.]</p>

<p>NIST has released a video and still-photo analysis of 7 World Trade Center before its collapse that appears to indicate a greater degree of structural damage from falling debris than originally assumed by FEMA. Specifically, NIST's interim report on 7 World Trade Center displays photographs of the southwest fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade of the building that show it to have significant damage. The report also highlights a 10-story gash in the center of the south fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, toward the bottom, extending approximately a quarter of the way into the interior.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> A unique aspect of the design of 7 World Trade Center was that each outer structural column was responsible for supporting 2,000 sq ft (186 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of floor space, suggesting that the simultaneous removal of a number of columns severely compromised the structure's integrity.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Consistent with this theory, news footage shows cracking and bowing of the building's east wall immediately before the collapse, which began at the penthouse floors.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In video of the collapse, taken from the north by <a href="CBS_News" title="wikilink">CBS News</a> and other news media, the first visible sign of collapse is movement in the east penthouse 8.2 seconds before the north wall began to collapse, which took at least another 7 seconds.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

The interior structure was unable to handle the redistributed load, resulting in horizontal progression of the failure across lower floors, particularly the 5th to 7th floors. This resulted in &quot;a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>Once construction of the power substation was complete in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower.
