<p>An <strong>unmanned aerial vehicle</strong> (<strong>UAV</strong>), commonly known as a <strong>drone</strong> and referred to as a <strong>Remotely Piloted Aircraft</strong> (<strong>RPA</strong>) by the <a href="International_Civil_Aviation_Organization" title="wikilink">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO), is an <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a> without a human <a href="Aviator" title="wikilink">pilot</a> aboard. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the <a href="Remote_control_vehicle" title="wikilink">remote control</a> of a <a href="Aviator" title="wikilink">pilot</a> on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a>, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The idea of a pilotless aircraft is not a new concept. The concept of drones dates back to the mid-1800s, when Austrians sent off unmanned, bomb-filled balloons as a way to attack Venice. The drone we see today started innovation in the early 1900s, and was originally used for target practice to train military personnel. It continued to be developed during World War I, when the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company came up with the a pilotless aerial torpedo that would drop and explode at a particular, preset time.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The earliest attempt at a powered unmanned aerial vehicle was <a href="Archibald_Low" title="wikilink">A.

<p>The birth of U.S. UAVs (called RPVs at the time) began in 1959 when <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) officers, concerned about losing <a href="Aviator" title="wikilink">pilots</a> over hostile territory, began planning for the use of <a href="Unmanned_Aircraft" title="wikilink">unmanned</a> flights.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This plan became intensified when <a href="Francis_Gary_Powers" title="wikilink">Francis Gary Powers</a> and his &quot;secret&quot; <a href="Lockheed_U-2" title="wikilink">U-2</a> were shot down over the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> in 1960.

<p>There are two prominent UAV programs within the United States: that of the military and that of the <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). The military&lt;U+2019&gt;s UAV program is overt, meaning that the public recognizes which government operates it and, therefore, it only operates where US troops are stationed. The CIA&lt;U+2019&gt;s program is clandestine.

<p>The CIA&lt;U+2019&gt;s UAV program was commissioned as a result of the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> and the increasing emphasis on operations for intelligence gathering in 2004.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This clandestine program is primarily being used in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. UAVs collect intelligence in these countries by loitering around their target. The CIA&lt;U+2019&gt;s first UAV program is called the Eagle Program. It was led by <a href="Duane_Clarridge" title="wikilink">Duane Clarridge</a>, the director of the <a href="Counterterrorism_Center" title="wikilink">Counterterrorism Center</a>. This program constructed the CIA&lt;U+2019&gt;s first using &lt;U+201C&gt;off the shelf technology,&lt;U+201D&gt; which included items such as garage door openers and model airplanes.</p>
<p>Only on February 26, 1973, during testimony before the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Appropriations" title="wikilink">United States House Committee on Appropriations</a>, the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been utilizing UAVs in <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a> (Vietnam).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were either missing in action (<a href="Missing_In_Action" title="wikilink">MIA</a>) or captured (prisoners of war/<a href="POW" class="uri" title="wikilink">POW</a>). The USAF <a href="100th_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Wing" title="wikilink">100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing</a> had flown approximately 3,435 UAV missions during the war<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF <a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="George_S._Brown" title="wikilink">George S. Brown</a>, Commander, <a href="Air_Force_Systems_Command" title="wikilink">Air Force Systems Command</a>, in 1972, &quot;The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don't want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Later that same year, General <a href="John_C._Meyer" title="wikilink">John C.

<p>During the 1973 <a href="Yom_Kippur_War" title="wikilink">Yom Kippur War</a>, Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli <a href="fighter_jet" title="wikilink">fighter jets</a>. As a result, Israel developed the first UAV with real-time surveillance.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to <a href="Operation_Mole_Cricket_19" title="wikilink">completely neutralize</a> the Syrian <a href="air_defense" title="wikilink">air defenses</a> at the start of the <a href="1982_Lebanon_War" title="wikilink">1982 Lebanon War</a>, resulting in no pilots downed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The first time UAVs were used as proof-of-concept of super-agility post-stall controlled flight in combat flight simulations was with tailless, stealth technology-based, three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight control, jet steering UAVs in Israel in 1987.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies as seen in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. In the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Defense gave a contract to U.S. corporation <a href="AAI_Corporation" title="wikilink">AAI Corporation</a> of <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> along with Israeli company Mazlat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that was jointly developed by American AAI Corporation and Israeli Mazlat, and this type of UAV is still in use. Many of these Pioneer and newly developed U.S. UAVs were used in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs were seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that could be used without risk to aircrews. Initial generations were primarily <a href="surveillance_aircraft" title="wikilink">surveillance aircraft</a>, but some were armed, such as the <a href="General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator" title="wikilink">General Atomics MQ-1 Predator</a>, which utilized <a href="AGM-114_Hellfire" title="wikilink">AGM-114 Hellfire</a> <a href="air-to-ground_missile" title="wikilink">air-to-ground missiles</a>. An armed UAV is known as an <a href="unmanned_combat_air_vehicle" title="wikilink">unmanned combat air vehicle</a> (UCAV).</p>
<p>As a tool for <a href="search_and_rescue" title="wikilink">search and rescue</a>, UAVs can help find humans lost in the wilderness, trapped in collapsed buildings, or adrift at sea.</p>
<p>In February 2013, it was reported that UAVs were used by at least 50 countries, several of which made their own: for example, Iran, Israel and <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2008, the United States Air Force employed 5,331 UAVs, which is twice its number of manned planes.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Out of these, the <a href="MQ-1_Predator" title="wikilink">Predators</a> are the most commendable. Unlike other UAVs, the Predator was armed with <a href="Hellfire_missiles" title="wikilink">Hellfire missiles</a> so that it can terminate the target that it locates (Carafano &amp; Gudgel, 2007). This was done after Predators sighted <a href="Osama_Bin_Laden" title="wikilink">Osama Bin Laden</a> multiple times but could not do anything about it other than send back images. In addition, the <a href="Predator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Predator</a> is capable of orchestrating attacks by pointing lasers at the targets (Singer, 2009b). This is important, as it puts a robot in a position to set off an attack. Their overall success is apparent because from June 2005 to June 2006 alone, Predators carried out 2,073 missions and participated in 242 separate raids (Singer, 2009a).</p>
<p>In contrast to the <a href="MQ-1_Predator" title="wikilink">Predator</a>, which is remotely piloted via satellites by pilots located 7,500 miles away, the <a href="Global_Hawk" title="wikilink">Global Hawk</a> operates virtually autonomously.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The user merely hits the button for &lt;U+2018&gt;take off&lt;U+2019&gt; and for &lt;U+2018&gt;land&lt;U+2019&gt;, while the UAV gets directions via GPS and reports back with a live feed. Global Hawks have the capability to fly from San Francisco and map out the entire state of Maine before having to return.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In addition, some UAVs have become so small that they can be launched from one&lt;U+2019&gt;s hand and maneuvered through the street.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> These UAVs, known as <a href="RQ-11_Raven" title="wikilink">Ravens</a>, are especially useful in urban areas, such as Iraq, in order to discover insurgents and potential ambushes the next block up (Carafano &amp; Gudgel, 2007). UAVs are especially useful because they can fly for days at a time. According to Carafano &amp; Gudgel, insurgents are loathe to stay in the open for more than a few minutes at a time for fear of UAVs locating them (2007)</p>

<p>The term <strong>unmanned aircraft system</strong> (<strong>UAS</strong>) emphasizes the importance of other elements beyond an aircraft itself. A typical UAS consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>unmanned aircraft (UA);</li>
<li>control system, such as <a href="Ground_Control_Station" title="wikilink">Ground Control Station</a> (GCS);</li>
<li>control link, a specialized <a href="datalink" class="uri" title="wikilink">datalink</a>; and</li>
<li>other related support equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <a href="RQ-7_Shadow" title="wikilink">RQ-7 Shadow</a> UAS consists of four UAs, two GCSs, one portable GCS, one Launcher, two Ground Data Terminals (GDTs), one portable GDT, and one Remote Video Terminal. Certain military units are also fielded with a maintenance support vehicle.</p>
<p>Because of this systemic approach, unmanned aircraft systems have not been included in the United States Munitions List Category VIII &lt;U+2013&gt; Aircraft and Associated Equipment. Vice versa, the &lt;U+201C&gt;Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems&lt;U+201D&gt; are clearly mentioned at paragraph 121-16 Missile Technology Control Regime Annex of the United States Munitions List. More precisely, the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex levels rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems together.</p>

<h4 id="unmanned-aircraft-system">Unmanned aircraft system</h4>
<p>An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) includes ground stations and other elements besides the actual aircraft. The term was first officially used by the FAA in early 2005 and subsequently adopted by DoD that same year in their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2030.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Many people have mistakenly used the term Unmanned <em>Aerial</em> System or Unmanned <em>Air Vehicle</em> System, as these designations were in provisional use at one time or another. The inclusion of the term <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a> emphasizes that regardless of the location of the pilot and flightcrew, the operations must comply with the same regulations and procedures as do those aircraft with the pilot and flightcrew on board. The official acronym <em>UAS</em> is also used by the <a href="International_Civil_Aviation_Organization" title="wikilink">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) and other government aviation regulatory organizations.</p>
<p><img src="Predator_and_Hellfire.jpg" title="fig:Predator launching a Hellfire missile" alt="Predator launching a Hellfire missile" /> The military role of unmanned aircraft systems is growing at unprecedented rates. In 2005, tactical- and theater-level unmanned aircraft alone had flown over 100,000 flight hours in support of <a href="Operation_Enduring_Freedom" title="wikilink">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> and <a href="Operation_Iraqi_Freedom" title="wikilink">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a>, in which they are organized under <a href="Task_Force_Liberty" title="wikilink">Task Force Liberty</a> in Afghanistan and <a href="Task_Force_ODIN" title="wikilink">Task Force ODIN</a> in Iraq. Rapid advances in technology are enabling more and more capability to be placed on smaller airframes, which is spurring a large increase in the number of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) being deployed on the battlefield. The use of SUAS in combat is so new that no formal DoD wide reporting procedures have been established to track SUAS flight hours. As the capabilities grow for all types of UAS, nations continue to subsidize their research and development, leading to further advances and enabling them to perform a multitude of missions. UAS no longer only perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, although this still remains their predominant type. Their roles have expanded to areas including <a href="electronic_attack" title="wikilink">electronic attack</a>, strike missions, <a href="suppression_of_enemy_air_defenses" title="wikilink">suppression</a> or destruction of enemy air defense, network node or communications relay, <a href="search_and_rescue" title="wikilink">combat search and rescue</a>, and derivations of these themes. These UAS range in cost from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars, with aircraft ranging from less than one pound to over 40,000 pounds.</p>
<p>When the Obama administration announced in December 2009 the deployment of 30,000 new troops in Afghanistan, there was already an increase of attacks by unmanned Predator UAVs against Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and <a href="Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas" title="wikilink">Pakistan's tribal areas</a>, of which one probably killed a key member of al-Qaeda. However, neither <a href="Osama_bin_Laden" title="wikilink">Osama bin Laden</a> nor <a href="Ayman_al-Zawahiri" title="wikilink">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a> was the likely target, according to reports. According to a report of the <a href="New_America_Foundation" title="wikilink">New America Foundation</a>, armed UAV strikes had dramatically increased under President Obama &lt;U+2013&gt; even before his deployment decision. There were 43 such attacks between January and October 2009. The report draws on what it deems to be <em>&quot;credible&quot;</em> local and national media stories about the attacks. This can be compared to a total of 34 in all of 2008, which was President Bush's last full year in office. Between 2006 and 2009, UAV-launched missiles allegedly had killed between 750 and 1,000 people in Pakistan, according to the report. Of these, about 20 people were said to be leaders of al-Qaeda, Taliban, and associated groups. Overall, 66% to 68% of the people killed were militants, and 31% to 33% were civilians. U.S. officials disputed the percentage for civilians.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The U.S. Air Force has recently begun referring at least to larger UAS like Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to highlight the fact that these systems are always controlled by a human operator at some location.</p>
<p>However, artificial intelligence is advancing to the point where the aircraft are easily capable of taking off, landing, and flying themselves. Then they simply have to be instructed as to their mission. The military distinguishes between &quot;man <em>in</em> the loop&quot;(piloted) and &quot;man <em>on</em> the loop&quot; (supervised) systems, with &quot;fully autonomous&quot; (issued orders) growing organically from the second into a third category. A.I. systems have been capable of making decisions and planning sequences of actions for decades; as of 2013, few fully autonomous systems have been constructed, but this is more a matter of convenience and technical implementation than of any fundamental barrier.</p>
<p>To distinguish UAVs from <em>missiles</em>, a UAV is defined as a &quot;powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Therefore, <a href="cruise_missile" title="wikilink">cruise missiles</a> are not considered UAVs because, like many other guided missiles, the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, even though it is also unmanned and in some cases remotely guided.</p>
<p>As of January 2014, the U.S. military operates a large number of unmanned aerial systems: 7,362 <a href="RQ-11_Raven" title="wikilink">RQ-11 Ravens</a>; 990 <a href="AeroVironment_Wasp_III" title="wikilink">AeroVironment Wasp IIIs</a>; 1,137 <a href="AeroVironment_RQ-20_Puma" title="wikilink">AeroVironment RQ-20 Pumas</a>; and 306 <a href="RQ-16_T-Hawk" title="wikilink">RQ-16 T-Hawk</a> small UAS systems and 246 <a href="MQ-1_Predator" title="wikilink">MQ-1 Predators</a> and <a href="MQ-1C_Grey_Eagle" title="wikilink">MQ-1C Grey Eagles</a>; 126 <a href="MQ-9_Reaper" title="wikilink">MQ-9 Reapers</a>; 491 <a href="RQ-7_Shadow" title="wikilink">RQ-7 Shadows</a>; and 33 <a href="RQ-4_Global_Hawk" title="wikilink">RQ-4 Global Hawk</a> large systems.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Beyond the military applications of UAVs with which &quot;drones&quot; became most associated, numerous civil aviation uses have been developed, including aerial surveying of crops, acrobatic aerial footage in filmmaking, search and rescue operations,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> inspecting power lines and pipelines, and counting wildlife,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> delivering medical supplies to remote or otherwise inaccessible regions,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> with some manufacturers <a href="rebranding" class="uri" title="wikilink">rebranding</a> the technology as &quot;unmanned aerial systems&quot; (UASs) in preference over &quot;drones.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Drones have also been used by animal-rights advocates to determine if illegal hunting is taking place, even on private property.

<h3 id="remote-sensing">Remote sensing</h3>
<p>UAV remote sensing functions include <a href="electromagnetic_spectrum" title="wikilink">electromagnetic spectrum</a> sensors, gamma ray sensors, biological sensors, and chemical sensors. A UAV's <a href="electromagnetic_sensor" title="wikilink">electromagnetic sensors</a> typically include <a href="visual_spectrum" title="wikilink">visual spectrum</a>, <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a>, or <a href="near_infrared" title="wikilink">near infrared</a> cameras as well as radar systems. Other electromagnetic wave detectors such as microwave and ultraviolet spectrum sensors may also be used but are uncommon. Biological sensors are sensors capable of detecting the airborne presence of various microorganisms and other biological factors. <a href="Chemical_sensors" title="wikilink">Chemical sensors</a> use <a href="Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">laser spectroscopy</a> to analyze the concentrations of each <a href="Chemical_element" title="wikilink">element</a> in the air.</p>
<h3 id="commercial-aerial-surveillance">Commercial aerial surveillance</h3>
<p>Aerial surveillance of large areas is made possible with low cost UAV systems. Surveillance applications include livestock monitoring, wildfire mapping, pipeline security, home security, road patrol, and anti-piracy. The trend for the use of UAV technology in commercial aerial surveillance is expanding rapidly with increased development of automated object detection approaches.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="commercial-and-motion-picture-filmmaking">Commercial and motion picture filmmaking</h3>
<p>In both Europe and the United States, UAV videography is a legal gray area. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and their European equivalents have not issued formal regulations and guidelines surrounding drones in the private sector. Much like how the explosive growth of crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo has caused headaches for legislators, UAV technology has advanced too quickly for bureaucrats to handle.</p>
<p>The FAA is debating offering guidelines for drone operators in the private sector by 2015, and European regulators are meeting on February 9 to iron out rules for UAVs in EU airspace. Domestically, lobbyists are petitioning the agency to give wide leeway to the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial photography, videography, and surveillance purposes. At the same time, lobbyists for occupations that stand to lose business to drones such as commercial pilots are petitioning the FAA to restrict drone use as well.</p>
<p>Colin Guinn of DJI Innovations, a Texas-based retail UAV manufacturer, told Co.Create that FAA regulations generally permit hobbyist drone use when they are flown below 400 feet, and within the UAV operator&lt;U+2019&gt;s line of sight. For commercial drone camerawork inside the United States, industry sources told us that use is largely at the de facto consent &lt;U+2013&gt; or benign neglect &lt;U+2013&gt; of local law enforcement. Use of UAVs for filmmaking is generally easier on large private lots or in rural and exurban areas with fewer space concerns. In certain localities such as Los Angeles and New York, authorities have actively interceded to shut down drone filmmaking efforts due to concerns driven by safety or terrorism.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>On 2 June 2014, the <a href="Federal_Aviation_Administration" title="wikilink">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) said it had received a petition from the <a href="Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Motion Picture Association of America</a> seeking approval for the use of drones in video and filmmaking. Low-cost drones could be used for shots that would otherwise require a helicopter or a manned aircraft, which would reduce costs argued seven companies behind the petition. Drones are already used by movie makers and media in other parts of the world. The FAA is required by <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> to come up with rules for commercial use of drones by 2015.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>
<p>Drones are starting to be used in sports photography and cinematography. For example, they were used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi for filming skiing and snowboarding events. Some advantages of using unmanned aerial vehicles in sports are that they allow video to get closer to the athletes, they are more flexible than cable-suspended camera systems.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 28, 2014, a North Dakota cattle rancher was sentenced to three years in prison, with all but six months suspended, for terrorizing police officers who were trying to arrest him at his property in 2011. The case garnered national attention because it was the first time a law-enforcement agency had used an unmanned aerial vehicle to assist in carrying out an arrest.

<h3 id="oil-gas-and-mineral-exploration-and-production">Oil, gas and mineral exploration and production</h3>
<p>UAVs can be used to perform geophysical surveys, in particular geomagnetic surveys<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> where the processed measurements of the Earth's differential magnetic field strength are used to calculate the nature of the underlying magnetic rock structure. A knowledge of the underlying rock structure helps trained geophysicists to predict the location of mineral deposits. The production side of oil and gas exploration and production entails the monitoring of the integrity of oil and gas pipelines and related installations. For above-ground pipelines, this monitoring activity could be performed using digital cameras mounted on one or more UAVs.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The <a href="InView_Unmanned_Aircraft_System" title="wikilink">InView UAV</a> is an example of a UAV developed for use in oil, gas, and mineral exploration and production activities.</p>

<h3 id="scientific-research">Scientific research</h3>
<p>Unmanned aircraft are especially useful in penetrating areas that may be too dangerous for manned aircraft. The <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) began utilizing the <a href="Insitu_Aerosonde" title="wikilink">Aerosonde</a> unmanned aircraft system in 2006 as a <a href="hurricane" class="uri" title="wikilink">hurricane</a> hunter. AAI Corporation subsidiary <a href="Aerosonde_Ltd" title="wikilink">Aerosonde Pty Ltd</a>. of <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>, Australia, designs and manufactures the 35-pound system, which can fly into a hurricane and communicate near-real-time data directly to the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>. Beyond the standard barometric pressure and temperature data typically culled from manned hurricane hunters, the Aerosonde system provides measurements far closer to the water&lt;U+2019&gt;s surface than previously captured. NASA later began using the <a href="Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk" title="wikilink">Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk</a> for extended hurricane measurements.</p>
<p>Further applications for unmanned aircraft can be explored once solutions have been developed for their accommodation within national airspace, an issue currently under discussion by the <a href="Federal_Aviation_Administration" title="wikilink">Federal Aviation Administration</a>. UAVSI, the UK manufacturer, also produces a variant of their Vigilant light UAS (20 kg) designed specifically for scientific research in severe climates, such as the Antarctic.</p>
<p>There have also been experiments with using UAVs as a construction and artwork tool<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> at locations such as the ETH Zurich.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="MQ-1_Predator" title="wikilink">MQ-1 Predator</a> UAVs armed with <a href="AGM-114_Hellfire" title="wikilink">Hellfire missiles</a> are increasingly used by the U.S. as platforms for hitting ground targets. Armed Predators were first used in late 2001 from bases in <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, mostly aimed at assassinating high profile individuals (terrorist leaders, etc.) inside Afghanistan. Since then, there have been many reported cases of such attacks taking place in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The advantage of using an unmanned vehicle rather than a manned aircraft in such cases is to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment should the aircraft be shot down and the pilots captured, since the bombings take place in countries deemed friendly and without the official permission of those countries.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

This marked the first use of an armed Predator as an attack aircraft outside of a theater of war such as Afghanistan.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The U.S. has claimed that the Predator strikes killed at least nine senior al-Qaeda leaders and dozens of lower-ranking operatives, depleting its operational tier in what U.S. officials described as the most serious disruption of al-Qaeda since 2001.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> It was claimed that the Predator strikes took such a toll on al-Qaeda that militants began turning violently on one another out of confusion and distrust.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said: &quot;They have started hunting down people who they think are responsible&quot; for security breaches. &quot;People are showing up dead, or disappearing.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>An attack by the US in December 2013, in a wedding procession in Yemen, killed 12 men and wounded at least 15 other people, including the bride. US and Yemeni officials said the dead were members of the armed group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch the casualties were civilians. Witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch that no members of AQAP were in the procession and provided names and other information about those killed and wounded. They said the dead included the groom&lt;U+2019&gt;s adult son and the bride received superficial face wounds. The local governor and military commander called the casualties a &lt;U+201C&gt;mistake&lt;U+201D&gt; and gave money and assault rifles to the families of those killed and wounded &lt;U+2013&gt; a traditional gesture of apology in Yemen.

<p>UAVs will likely play an increased role in search and rescue in the United States. This was demonstrated by the use of UAVs during the 2008 hurricanes that struck Louisiana and Texas. Micro UAVs, such as the <a href="Aeryon_Scout" title="wikilink">Aeryon Scout</a>, have been used to perform Search and Rescue activities on a smaller scale, such as the search for missing persons.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> For example, Predators, operating between 18,000&lt;U+2013&gt;29,000 feet above sea level, performed search and rescue and damage assessment.

The Predator's SAR is a sophisticated all-weather sensor capable of providing photographic-like images through clouds, rain or fog, and in daytime or nighttime conditions, all in real-time. A concept of coherent change detection in SAR images allows for exceptional search and rescue ability: photos taken before and after the storm hits are compared, and a computer highlights areas of damage.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

<p>Development costs for American military UAVs, as with most military programs, have tended to overrun their initial estimates.

<p>One of the main barriers to rapid full-scale growth of commercial unmanned aircraft is the concern for safety. As a myriad of certification agencies scramble to keep up with the unique demands of this fast-growing industry, one thing is clear &lt;U+2013&gt; where applicable, pertinent certification standards for manned aircraft are starting to apply. For the complex electronics that provide communication and control of these systems, this means a swift move towards compliance with <a href="DO-178C" class="uri" title="wikilink">DO-178C</a> and <a href="DO-254" class="uri" title="wikilink">DO-254</a> for software and hardware development.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In most cases, the unmanned aircraft can only be operated as part of a system, hence the term &lt;U+201C&gt;unmanned aircraft system&lt;U+201D&gt; or UAS.

Within the United States, the Congress passed a bill in 2012 that mandated the FAA create a plan for allowing UAS into commercial airspace. Subsequently, the FAA issued &lt;U+201C&gt;the Integration of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) Roadmap&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2014, obtaining an <a href="Airworthiness_certificate#Special_Airworthiness_Certificates" title="wikilink">experimental airworthiness certificate</a> for a particular UAS is the only way <em>civil operators</em> of unmanned aircraft are accessing the <a href="National_Airspace_System" title="wikilink">National Airspace System</a> of the United States.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> <a href="FAA_Order_8130.34" title="wikilink">FAA Order 8130.34</a>, <em>Airworthiness Certification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems</em>, establishes procedures for issuing this certification, and as such establishes guidance standards for certification aspects of development and operation, which may be addressed by adoption of such standards as <a href="ARP4754" title="wikilink">ARP4754A</a>, and <a href="DO-178C" class="uri" title="wikilink">DO-178C</a>.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>The FAA roadmap is, in essence, maturation of the acceptance of UAVs from this &lt;U+201C&gt;experimental&lt;U+201D&gt; aircraft certification to requiring the same standard airworthiness <a href="Type_certificate" title="wikilink">type certification</a> of manufacturing design as is now required of conventional manned aircraft.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<p>Early UAVs used during the Vietnam War captured video that was recorded to film or tape on the aircraft. These aircraft often flew either in a straight line or in preset circles collecting video until they ran out of fuel and landed. After landing, the film was recovered for analysis. Because of the simple, repetitive nature of these operations, the aircraft were often called &quot;drones&quot;. As new radio control systems became available, UAVs were often remote controlled, and the term &quot;remotely piloted vehicle&quot; came into vogue. Today's UAVs often combine remote control and computerized automation. More sophisticated versions may have built-in control or guidance systems to perform low-level human pilot duties, such as speed and flight-path stabilization, and simple scripted navigation functions, such as waypoint following. In news and other discussions, the term &quot;drone&quot; is still often mistakenly used to refer to these more sophisticated aircraft.</p>
<p>Most early UAVs were not autonomous at all. The field of air-vehicle autonomy is a recently emerging field, largely driven by the military to develop battle-ready technology.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Compared to the manufacturing of UAV flight hardware, the market for autonomy technology is fairly immature and undeveloped.</p>
<p>Autonomy technology that is important to UAV development falls under the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Sensor_fusion" title="wikilink">Sensor fusion</a>: Combining information from different sensors for use on board the vehicle including the automatic interpretation of ground imagery <a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></li>
<li>Communications: Handling communication and coordination between multiple agents in the presence of incomplete and imperfect information</li>
<li>Path planning: Determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting certain objectives and mission constraints, such as obstacles or fuel requirements</li>
<li>Trajectory Generation (sometimes called <a href="Motion_planning" title="wikilink">Motion planning</a>): Determining an optimal control maneuver to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another</li>
<li>Trajectory Regulation: The specific control strategies required to constrain a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory</li>
<li>Task Allocation and Scheduling: Determining the optimal distribution of tasks amongst a group of agents within time and equipment constraints</li>
<li>Cooperative Tactics: Formulating an optimal sequence and spatial distribution of activities between agents in order to maximize the chance of success in any given mission scenario</li>
</ul>
<p>Autonomy is commonly defined as the ability to make decisions without human intervention. To that end, the goal of autonomy is to teach machines to be &quot;smart&quot; and act more like humans. The keen observer may associate this with the developments in the field of <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a> made popular in the 1980s and 1990s, such as <a href="expert_system" title="wikilink">expert systems</a>, <a href="neural_network" title="wikilink">neural networks</a>, <a href="machine_learning" title="wikilink">machine learning</a>, <a href="natural_language_processing" title="wikilink">natural language processing</a>, and vision. However, the mode of technological development in the field of autonomy has mostly followed a bottom-up approach, such as <a href="hierarchical_control_system" title="wikilink">hierarchical control systems</a>,<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> and recent advances have been largely driven by the practitioners in the field of <a href="Control_(science)" title="wikilink">control science</a>, not computer science. Similarly, autonomy has been and probably will continue to be considered an extension of the controls field.</p>
<p>To some extent, the ultimate goal in the development of autonomy technology is to replace the human pilot. It remains to be seen whether future developments of autonomy technology, the perception of the technology, and, most importantly, the political climate surrounding the use of such technology will limit the development and utility of autonomy for UAV applications. Also as a result of this, <a href="synthetic_vision" title="wikilink">synthetic vision</a> for piloting has not caught on in the UAV arena as it did with manned aircraft. NASA utilized synthetic vision for test pilots on the <a href="HiMAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">HiMAT</a> program in the early 1980s (see photo), but the advent of more autonomous UAV autopilots greatly reduced the need for this technology.</p>
<p>Interoperable UAV technologies became essential as systems proved their mettle in military operations, taking on tasks too challenging or dangerous for troops. NATO addressed the need for commonality through STANAG (Standardization Agreement) 4586. According to a NATO press release, the agreement began the ratification process in 1992. Its goal was to allow allied nations to easily share information obtained from unmanned aircraft through common ground control station technology. Aircraft that adhere to the <a href="STANAG" class="uri" title="wikilink">STANAG</a> 4586 protocol are equipped to translate information into standardized message formats; likewise, information received from other compliant aircraft can be transferred into vehicle-specific messaging formats for seamless interoperability. Amendments have since been made to the original agreement based on expert feedback from the field and an industry panel known as the Custodian Support Team. Edition Two of STANAG 4586 is currently under review. There are many systems available today that are developed in accordance with STANAG 4586, including products by industry leaders such as AAI Corporation, <a href="CDL_Systems" title="wikilink">CDL Systems</a>, and Raytheon, all three of which are members of the Custodian Support Team for this protocol.</p>
<h3 id="endurance">Endurance</h3>
<p>Because UAVs are not burdened with the physiological limitations of human pilots, they can be designed for maximized on-station times. The maximum flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles varies widely. Internal combustion engine aircraft endurance depends strongly on the percentage of fuel burned as a fraction of total weight (the <a href="Louis_Charles_Breguet" title="wikilink">Breguet</a> endurance equation) and so is largely independent of aircraft size.</p>
<p><img src="UAV-741-F.jpg" title="fig:UEL UAV-741 Wankel engine for UAV operations" alt="UEL UAV-741 Wankel engine for UAV operations" /> Because of the small size, weight, very low vibration and high power to weight ratio, <a href="Wankel_engine" title="wikilink">Wankel rotary engines</a> are increasingly being used in UAV aircraft.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The engine is approximately one third of the size and weight of a piston engine of equivalent power output, which offers significant advantages for UAV aircraft.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Additionally: the engine rotors cannot seize, since rotor casings expand more than rotors; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent; it does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power and having no reciprocating parts, there is less vulnerability to damage when the engines revolves higher than the designed maximum running operation. The attributes of the Wankel engine transpire into less fuel usage in UAVs giving greater range or a higher payload.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>Solar-electric UAVs hold potential for unlimited flight, a concept originally championed by the <a href="AstroFlight_Sunrise" title="wikilink">AstroFlight Sunrise</a> in 1974<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a><a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> and the much later Aerovironment <a href="Helios_Prototype" title="wikilink">Helios Prototype</a>, which was destroyed in a 2003 crash.</p>
<p>Electric UAVs kept aloft indefinitely by laser power-beaming<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> technology represent another proposed solution to the endurance challenge. This approach is advocated by <a href="Jordin_Kare" title="wikilink">Jordin Kare</a> and Thomas Nugent.</p>
<p>One of the major problems with UAVs is the lack of inflight refueling capability. In 2012, the US Air Force was promoting research that should end in an inflight UAV refueling capability.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> A UAV-UAV simulated refuelling flight using two <a href="Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk" title="wikilink">Global Hawks</a> was achieved in 2012.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the uses for a high endurance UAV would be to &quot;stare&quot; at the battlefield for a long period of time to produce a record of events that could then be played backwards to track where improvised explosive devices (<a href="Improvised_explosive_device" title="wikilink">IEDs</a>) came from. Air Force Chief of Staff <a href="John_P._Jumper" title="wikilink">John P. Jumper</a> started a program to create these persistent UAVs, but this was stopped once he was replaced.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (<a href="DARPA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DARPA</a>) revealed a program to develop technology for a UAV with an endurance capability of over 5 years. The program, entitled VULTURE (Very-high altitude, Ultra-endurance, Loitering Theater Unmanned Reconnaissance Element<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a>), entered Phase II on September 14, 2010, with a contract signed with Boeing for development of the <a href="Boeing_SolarEagle" title="wikilink">SolarEagle</a> flight demonstrator.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>

<p>An August 2013 Brookings Institution study reported that in the U.S. Air Force there were approximately 1,300 remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilots, 8.5 percent of total Air Force pilots, up from 3.3 percent in 2008.<a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424"><sup>424</sup></a> The study indicated that the U.S. military's combat air patrol (CAP) daily missions requirement is growing at a faster pace than RPA pilots can be trained, with an attrition rate during RPA flight screening being three times that of traditional pilots and a 13% lower promotion rate to Major than other officers.<a href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425"><sup>425</sup></a></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="public-opinion-in-the-us">Public opinion in the US</h2>
<p>In February 2013, <a href="Fairleigh_Dickinson_University" title="wikilink">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>'s PublicMind poll found that 48% of American voters believe it is &quot;illegal for the U.S. government to target its own citizens living abroad with drone attacks. Just 24% say that it's legal.&quot;<a href="#fn433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433"><sup>433</sup></a> &quot;The public clearly makes an assumption very different from that of the Obama administration or Mr. Brennan: the public thinks targeting American citizens abroad is out of bounds,&quot; Peter Woolley, founding director of PublicMind and professor of political science at FDU, said to CNN.<a href="#fn434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref434"><sup>434</sup></a></p>
<p>In the same poll, however, by a wide six-to-one margin (75% vs.13%), voters approved of the U.S. military using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad &lt;U+201C&gt;on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.&lt;U+201D&gt; Republicans, men, and whites approve more strongly than Democrats, women, and non-whites, but approval is robust in all demographic categories. Voters also approve of the CIA using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad by a strong three-to-one margin (65% vs. 21%), but this approval is significantly less than approval for the U.S. military carrying out such attacks.<a href="#fn435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435"><sup>435</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite this broad-based public support, there are a number of vocal critics of the increasing use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/opinion/17exum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> that &quot;according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians. This is 50 civilians for every militant killed, a hit rate of 2 percent.&quot; Other studies have put the civilian casualty rate anywhere between 4 and 35 percent.<a href="#fn436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref436"><sup>436</sup></a> It is difficult to reconcile these figures because the drone strikes are often in areas that are inaccessible to independent observers and the data includes reports by local officials and local media, neither of whom are reliable sources. Critics also fear that by making killing seem clean and safe, so-called surgical UAV strikes will allow the United States to remain in a perpetual state of war. However, others maintain that drones &quot;allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare&quot; and are subject to Congressional oversight.<a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437"><sup>437</sup></a> Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike, thus &quot;the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all.&quot;<a href="#fn438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref438"><sup>438</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="lobbying-in-the-us">Lobbying in the US</h2>
<p>&quot;Movie makers, real-estate agents, criminal-defense lawyers and farmers are among at least 68 groups with a newfound political interest in drones according to Center for Responsive Politics data compiled by Bloomberg&quot;.<a href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439"><sup>439</sup></a> At least 28 universities and local government agencies as well as Amazon hope to use drones civilly someday. limited commercial operations for drones weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) is a proposal due to be decided upon by the end of the year. In June 2014, the <a href="Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Motion Picture Association of America</a> stated its support of an FAA exemption for the use of small drones in limited low risk scenarios in film and television productions.<a href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440"><sup>440</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="morality">Morality</h2>
<p>The &lt;U+201C&gt;unmanned&lt;U+201D&gt; aspect of UAVs is primarily what sets them apart from manned aircraft. This aspect also raises certain moral concerns. Some believe that the asymmetry of fighting humans with machines that are controlled from a safe distance lacks integrity and honor that was once valued during warfare. Others feel that if such technology is available, then there is a moral duty to employ it in order to save as many lives as possible.<a href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref441"><sup>441</sup></a> Another potential moral issue with UAVs is that because they do not allow for pilot casualties, some fear that they will be used more frivolously, and that human lives affected by UAV-based strikes will not be regarded with as much consideration as with manned aerial attacks.</p>
<h3 id="civilian-death">Civilian death</h3>
<p>Some critics emphasize that the use of drones promotes not only a physical, but emotional disengagement from on the ground combat, for example, which is historically the foundation of military combat. This has a number of implications. Individuals taking on a critique of drone use challenge the supposed sense of morality and ethics that is taken on when justifying drone use. The evolution of new types of warfare creates a growing detachment from direct combat via the increased use of drones, and distances combatants from the consequences of their actions. Therefore, the use of drones is often associated with the idea that it is more ethical; the minimization of U.S. casualties due to this distancing, for example, is another reason drone use is increasingly looked at as an improved technique of war. Critics argue this detachment is failing to address the reality of innocent civilians being killed through this war strategy.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>The use of drones can be understood as a manifestation and extension of the technological revolution in military affairs (RMA) discourse. The hegemonic masculinities in the American military influenced the development of technology as it became more prevalent following the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>.<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442"><sup>442</sup></a> The entrenchment of this masculinity is even apparent in the present day, as women quite often have inferior positions to men in technology research, development, and use. These concerns are not only limited to drone use; <a href="cyborgs" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyborgs</a> are also a manifestation of technology and new wars developing from RMA. These new types of technologies create new ways in which soldiers are conceptualized. Traditionally, soldiers were considered to be physical combatants, whereas now, technology in warfare blurs the distinction between autonomous users and who is representative of a soldier.<a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443"><sup>443</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>One of the more mobilized groups engaged in this dialogue is <a href="Code_Pink" title="wikilink">Code Pink</a>, a grassroots peace movement concerned with global social justice. This is a group primarily composed of women and led by women, seeking to mobilize against the United States military and the particular wars or battle campaigns they associate themselves with, either economically or militarily.<a href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444"><sup>444</sup></a> For example, Code Pink has facilitated a number of summits and campaigns against drones internationally and domestically.</p>
<h2 id="legality">Legality</h2>
<p>A confidential Justice Department memo concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be &lt;U+201C&gt;senior operational leaders&lt;U+201D&gt; of <a href="Al-Qaeda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Qaeda</a> or &lt;U+201C&gt;an associated force&lt;U+201D&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445"><sup>445</sup></a> The secrecy surrounding such strikes is quickly emerging as a central issue in the hearing of <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> counterterrorism adviser <a href="John_O._Brennan" title="wikilink">John O. Brennan</a>, a key architect of the UAV campaign, to be CIA director. Brennan was the first administration official to publicly acknowledge UAV-based strikes in a speech last year, calling them &lt;U+201C&gt;consistent with the inherent right of self-defense.&lt;U+201D&gt; In a separate talk at the Northwestern University Law School, Attorney General <a href="Eric_Holder" title="wikilink">Eric Holder</a> specifically endorsed the constitutionality of targeted killings of Americans, saying they could be justified if government officials determine that the target poses &lt;U+201C&gt;an imminent threat of violent attack.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446"><sup>446</sup></a> But the confidential Justice Department &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="white_paper" title="wikilink">white paper</a>&lt;U+201D&gt; introduces a more expansive definition of self-defense or imminent attack than described by Brennan or Holder in their public speeches It refers, for example, to what it calls a &lt;U+201C&gt;broader concept of imminence&lt;U+201D&gt; than actual intelligence about any ongoing plot against the U.S. homeland. &quot;The condition that an operational leader presents an &lt;U+2018&gt;imminent&lt;U+2019&gt; threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future,&lt;U+201D&gt; the memo states.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref447"><sup>447</sup></a> Instead, an &lt;U+201C&gt;informed, high-level&lt;U+201D&gt; official of the U.S. government may determine that the targeted American has been &lt;U+201C&gt;recently&lt;U+201D&gt; involved in &lt;U+201C&gt;activities&lt;U+201D&gt; posing a threat of a violent attack and &lt;U+201C&gt;there is no evidence suggesting that he has renounced or abandoned such activities.&lt;U+201D&gt; (The memo does not define &lt;U+201C&gt;recently&lt;U+201D&gt; or &lt;U+201C&gt;activities.&lt;U+201D&gt;)</p>
<p>As in Holder&lt;U+2019&gt;s speech, the confidential memo lays out a three-part test that would make targeted killings of American lawful: in addition to the suspect being an imminent threat, capture of the target must be &lt;U+201C&gt;infeasible, and the strike must be conducted according to &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="laws_of_war" title="wikilink">laws of war</a> principles.&lt;U+201D&gt; But the memo elaborates on some of these factors in ways that go beyond what the attorney general said publicly. For example, it states that U.S. officials may consider whether an attempted capture of a suspect would pose an &lt;U+201C&gt;undue risk&lt;U+201D&gt; to U.S. personnel involved in such an operation. If so, U.S. officials could determine that the capture operation of the targeted American would not be feasible, making it lawful for the U.S. government to order a killing instead, the memo concludes. The undated memo is entitled &lt;U+201C&gt;Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of <a href="Al_Qaeda" title="wikilink">Al Qaeda</a> or An Associated Force.&lt;U+201D&gt; It was provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees in June 2013 by administration officials on the condition that it be kept confidential and not discussed publicly.<a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448"><sup>448</sup></a> Although not an official legal memo, the white paper was represented by administration officials as a policy document that closely mirrors the arguments of classified memos on targeted killings by the Justice Department&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Office_of_Legal_Counsel" title="wikilink">Office of Legal Counsel</a>, which provides authoritative legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies. The administration has refused to turn over to Congress or release those memos publicly or to even publicly confirm their existence. A source with access to the white paper, which is not classified, provided a copy to <a href="NBC_News" title="wikilink">NBC News</a>.<a href="#fn449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref449"><sup>449</sup></a></p>
<p>The white paper also includes a more extensive discussion of why targeted strikes against Americans does not violate constitutional protections afforded to American citizens as well as a U.S. law that criminalizes the killing of U.S. nationals overseas. It also discusses why such targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate a U.S. executive order banning assassinations. &lt;U+201C&gt;A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination,&lt;U+201D&gt; the white paper reads. &lt;U+201C&gt;In the Department&lt;U+2019&gt;s view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450"><sup>450</sup></a></p>
