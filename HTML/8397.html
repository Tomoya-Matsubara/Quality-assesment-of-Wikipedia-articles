<p>The <strong>1945 Homestead hurricane</strong> was the most intense <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> to <a href="Landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">strike</a> the U.S. state of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> since <a href="1935_Labor_Day_hurricane" title="wikilink">1935</a>. The ninth <a href="tropical_cyclone_scales" title="wikilink">tropical storm</a>, third hurricane, and third <a href="Saffir-Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a> of the <a href="1945_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">season</a>, it developed <a href="boxing_the_compass" title="wikilink">east-northeast</a> of the <a href="Leeward_Islands" title="wikilink">Leeward Islands</a> on September 12. Moving briskly west-northwestward, the storm became a major hurricane on September 13. The system moved over the <a href="Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" title="wikilink">Turks and Caicos Islands</a> the following day and then <a href="Andros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andros</a> on September 15. Later that day, the storm peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the modern-day <a href="Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir&lt;U+2013&gt;Simpson hurricane wind scale</a> with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Late on September 15, the hurricane made landfall on <a href="Key_Largo,_Florida" title="wikilink">Key Largo</a> and then in southern <a href="Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami-Dade County</a>.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the hurricane began to weaken while moving across Florida, falling to Category 1 intensity only several hours after landfall late on September 15. Eventually, it curved north-northeastward and approached the east coast of Florida again. Late on September 16, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near <a href="St._Augustine,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a> and weakened to a tropical storm early on the following day. The cyclone made another landfall near the <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>-<a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> state line later on September 17. The system continued to weaken and transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> near the border of <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> early on September 18.</p>
<p>The storm caused significant damage and 22 deaths in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas. In Florida, the hardest hit area was <a href="Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami-Dade County</a>. Most of the city of <a href="Homestead,_Florida" title="wikilink">Homestead</a> was destroyed, while at the <a href="Richmond_Naval_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Richmond Naval Air Station</a>, a fire ignited during the storm burned down three hangers worth $3 million (1945 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>) each. Throughout the state, the strong winds destroyed 1,632 residences and damaged 5,372 homes others. Four people died, including the fire chief of the Richmond station. In <a href="the_Carolinas" title="wikilink">the Carolinas</a>, the storm produced heavy rainfall, causing flash flooding, particularly along the <a href="Cape_Fear_River" title="wikilink">Cape Fear River</a> in North Carolina. Overall, the hurricane resulted in 26 fatalities and about $60 million in damage.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The hurricane was first observed on September 12 about 235 mi (380 km) east-northeast of <a href="Barbuda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbuda</a> in the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser Antilles</a>. Around that time, the winds were estimated at 75 mph (120 km/h), and later that day, the <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> recorded peripheral winds of 54 mph (87 km/h). Moving quickly to the west-northwest, the hurricane quickly intensified while passing north of Puerto Rico, reaching the equivalent of a modern-day <a href="Tropical_cyclone_scales#Atlantic_and_East_Pacific" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a> with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). The strength was based on another Hurricane Hunters mission reporting flight-level winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After passing north of Hispaniola, the hurricane turned moved toward the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, approaching or passing over <a href="Grand_Turk_Island" title="wikilink">Grand Turk Island</a> at 0530 <a href="Coordinated_Universal_Time" title="wikilink">UTC</a> on September 14. A station on the island observed a <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of  during the passage, and nearby <a href="Clarence_Town" title="wikilink">Clarence Town</a> reported winds of 104 mph (168 km/h). While moving through the Bahamas, the hurricane turned more to the northwest. It was a smaller than average storm, and continued intensifying while moving toward southeastern Florida.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>At 1930 UTC on September 15, the hurricane made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on <a href="Key_Largo" title="wikilink">Key Largo</a>, and about a half hour later struck the Florida mainland.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The center passed very close to <a href="Homestead_Air_Reserve_Base" title="wikilink">Homestead Air Reserve Base</a> about an hour after landfall, where a central <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of  was recorded.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The observation suggested a landfall pressure of , and based on its small size and peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h); equivalent to a <a href="List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes" title="wikilink">Category 4</a> on the current <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Wind_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a>. This estimate was backed up by gust of 138 mph (222 km/h) at <a href="Carysfort_Reef_Light" title="wikilink">Carysfort Reef Light</a>. The hurricane weakened over Florida while curving to the north and north-northeast, although the proximity to water and the passage over the <a href="Everglades" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everglades</a> limited substantial weakening. Hurricane force winds spread across much of Florida until the storm emerged into the western Atlantic near <a href="St._Augustine,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a> late on September 16. At around 0000 UTC the next day, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. About 11 hours later, it made another landfall near the border between <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> and <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a> with winds of 70 mph (120 km/h).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After continuing through the southeast United States, the storm became <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> near the border of <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> midday on September 18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September 19 while it was near <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and along the coast of Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September 19, the storm moved across <a href="Nova_Scotia" title="wikilink">Nova Scotia</a>, passing southeast of <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> the next day. It was last observed late on September 20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
