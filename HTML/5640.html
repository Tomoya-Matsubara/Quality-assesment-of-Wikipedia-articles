<p><strong>Hungarian comics</strong> are <a href="comics" class="uri" title="wikilink">comics</a> made in <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> and by the <a href="Hungary#Ethnic_Hungarians_in_neighbouring_countries" title="wikilink"> Hungarian diaspora of the surrounding countries</a>. When dealing with Hungarian comics, one cannot separate comics made by Hungarians from translated foreign matter, since in some eras most of the publications come from the latter group and influence comics fandom and the general picture about comics in the country.</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
<p>The Hungarian word for comics is <em>k&lt;U+00E9&gt;preg&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny</em>, a combined word from <em>k&lt;U+00E9&gt;p</em> (picture) and <em>reg&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny</em> (novel). The words <em>comics</em> (referring to <a href="American_comics" title="wikilink">American comics</a>), <em><a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a></em> (referring to mainly Japanese comics), <em>bd / bande dessin&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> (referring to <a href="Franco-Belgian_comics" title="wikilink">Franco-Belgian comics</a>) are sometimes used in Hungarian context, but are not general except for the case of manga.</p>

<p>(The history of Hungarian comics is best divided along political eras, because of the great influence politics made on comics.)</p>

Pages were filled with <a href="caricature" title="wikilink">caricatures</a> and &quot;<em>pictorial stories</em>&quot; (k&lt;U+00E9&gt;pt&lt;U+00F6&gt;rt&lt;U+00E9&gt;netek, k&lt;U+00E9&gt;pes t&lt;U+00F6&gt;rt&lt;U+00E9&gt;netek), the European predecessor of modern comics. A short story was told in few sequential pictures, and the text (many times in rhyming poetic form) was placed beneath the images. Many similar journals existed besides &lt;U+00DC&gt;st&lt;U+00F6&gt;k&lt;U+00F6&gt;s. Hungary had a flourishing caricature culture at the time, and many of the greatest artists also drew these early types of comics.</p>

American comics flooded all kinds of newspapers, magazines. <em>H&lt;U+00E1&gt;ri J&lt;U+00E1&gt;nos</em> (see image) (1936-1937<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>), a magazine for children is considered to be the first Hugnarian comic book magazine, with comic strips on every page. <a href="Disney_comics" title="wikilink">Walt Disney strips</a>, Secret Agent X-09, <a href="Little_Nemo_in_Slumberland" title="wikilink">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a> (Kis N&lt;U+00E9&gt;m&lt;U+00F3&gt; &lt;U+00C1&gt;lomorsz&lt;U+00E1&gt;gban), <a href="George_McManus" title="wikilink">George McManus</a> strips and many others marked this period. Not as many Hungarian comics were made in this period, while &lt;U+2013&gt; for example &lt;U+2013&gt; Yugoslavia, the southern neighbor, claims this period to be their Golden Age.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>During this period the <a href="Treaty_of_Trianon" title="wikilink">truncated Hungary</a> was an ally of Germany. In 1937 the Minister of Justice began restricting the great amount of pulp literature and yellow press. In 1938 a decree ordered the whole press under the control of the Government. In the same year the &quot;First Jewish Law&quot; was issued.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Among others the goal of these two were to &lt;U+201C&gt;clean&lt;U+201D&gt; Hungary&lt;U+2019&gt;s cultural life, to eliminate pulp literature. As the &lt;U+00DA&gt;js&lt;U+00E1&gt;g, a Hungarian extremist newspaper, commented in 1938: <em>&quot;These are not at all capable to nurture Hungarian self-knowledge, Hungarian honesty, Hungarian heroism, consequentially to nurture the Hungarian folk, national and racial self-knowledge.&quot;</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Since most of the comics were published in the mostly Jewish owned <a href="Yellow_journalism" title="wikilink"> yellow press</a>, comics vanished after the law took effect. The situation became even worse after the German troops marched in Hungary: all leftist and liberal media was banned. The only comics of the time were antisemitic ones from magazines as the militant Harc (&quot;<em>Combat</em>&quot;) or anticommunist ones from newspapers as Egyed&lt;U+00FC&gt;l vagyunk (&quot;<em>We are alone</em>&quot;). <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Magveto.jpg" title="fig:A cover from communist peasant youth magazine, with collectivist propaganda comics. A typical example from the late 1940&#39;s." alt="A cover from communist peasant youth magazine, with collectivist propaganda comics. A typical example from the late 1940&#39;s." />In the post war period, Hungary&lt;U+2019&gt;s cultural-politics were heavily influenced by the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. In the first few years comics returned to the newspapers and other magazines: first humorous children comics in 1945, then communist propaganda strips in 1948. The Hungarian term for comics &lt;U+2013&gt; <em>k&lt;U+00E9&gt;preg&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; became widespread during this short period. In 1950 &lt;U+2013&gt; according to a famous anecdote &lt;U+2013&gt; during a visit to Budapest, Finogenov, an influential aesthete from Moscow, called comic books an &lt;U+201C&gt;imperialist vestige&lt;U+201D&gt;. Within a few days Hungarian prime minister, <a href="M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ty&lt;U+00E1&gt;s_R&lt;U+00E1&gt;kosi" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ty&lt;U+00E1&gt;s R&lt;U+00E1&gt;kosi</a> withdrew all the &lt;U+201C&gt;western cultural trash&lt;U+201D&gt; from the press.</p>
<p>Furthermore Dr. Frederick Wertham&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Seduction_of_the_Innocent" title="wikilink">Seduction of the Innocent</a> attracted some attention on the eastern side of the iron curtain. His anti-comics accusations echoed in Hungarian newspaper articles. Some of these were written by Hungarian journalists, but some were translations of American articles (at least signed by American names).</p>
<p>In 1954 <em>Ern&lt;U+0151&gt; Z&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00E1&gt;d</em>, one of Hungary&lt;U+2019&gt;s all-time greatest comic book artists, dared to bring back comics with his adaptation of <a href="Vladimir_Obruchev" title="wikilink">Vladimir Obruchev</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s Plutonia (<em>Az &lt;U+00C9&gt;szaki-sarkr&lt;U+00F3&gt;l a F&lt;U+00F6&gt;ld belsej&lt;U+00E9&gt;be</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; From the North Pole to the Center of the Earth in English). This was published in <em>Pajt&lt;U+00E1&gt;s</em>, a magazine for the <a href="Pioneer_movement" title="wikilink">Pioneer movement</a> (the communist co-ed equivalent for scouting). 1955 was a milestone in Hungarian comic book history, since this was the year when graphic illustrator <em>S&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndor Gugi</em> convinced <em>Tibor Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th</em> (Later Tibor Cs. Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th) to create some comics together. It was also Gugi&lt;U+2019&gt;s idea to produce comics that adapt classic literature. No one could call adaptations of famous and recognized literary works &lt;U+201C&gt;decadent western trash&lt;U+201D&gt;, so comics received a green light at the time. Adaptational comics, what started out as a trick, became dominant for decades. S&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndor Gugi left the field relatively early, but Tibor Cs. Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th produced a vast of comics scripts for some very talented artists such as <em>Imre Seb&lt;U+0151&gt;k</em>, <em>P&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros</em> and <em>Ern&lt;U+0151&gt; Z&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00E1&gt;d</em>. These three had their own easily recognizable style and are considered the greatest comic artists of Hungary.</p>
<p>At the time comics were not published in separate comic books, but sequentially in newspapers (e.g. N&lt;U+00E9&gt;pszava), magazines (e.g. K&lt;U+00E9&gt;pes &lt;U+00DA&gt;js&lt;U+00E1&gt;g, Pajt&lt;U+00E1&gt;s), and the crossword puzzle magazine F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les. F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les later became the flagship of Hungarian comic publishing. In December 1956, a few weeks after the soviet tanks ended the <a href="Hungarian_Revolution_1956" title="wikilink"> Revolution of 1956</a>, Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy G&lt;U+00E1&gt;l and some journalists started conceiving a new, entertaining weekly magazine based on previous magazines such as Pesti Iz&lt;U+00E9&gt; and F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les Bagoly. The magazine based on crossword puzzles, articles and comics became a large success. Some say the magazine had a role in healing the wounds.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Lathatatlan_legio.jpg" title="fig:A page illustrating adaptational comics with too much textual information (Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt;/Cs.Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th/Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros: A l&lt;U+00E1&gt;thatatlan ember)" alt="A page illustrating adaptational comics with too much textual information (Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt;/Cs.Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th/Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros: A l&lt;U+00E1&gt;thatatlan ember)" />Adaptational comics still are a basis of controversies and debates. Although in most cases the art was beautiful, the panels were heavily packed with narrative texts &lt;U+2013&gt; a trademark of Tibor Cs. Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th. By the early sixties this comics type fell into a complex trap from which it couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t escape until recent times. On one hand intellectuals criticized these works for the lack of originality, novelty and artistry<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, while another major accusation was that comics in general brake reading habits<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. But adaptational comics provided a safe relationship with the cultural-political leadership, and were still popular, comic book import was close to zero, so nothing forced comic artists to move on further.</p>
<p>Although this compromise made the production of comics possible &lt;U+2013&gt; at least until some extent. In many other countries of the Ex-Eastern Bloc (e.g. <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>) the situation was even worse with almost absolutely no comics of their own. However it should be noted that some other Eastern Bloc counties at that time had substantial comic book culture: Yugoslavia, Poland. (Yugoslavia was not influenced directly by the Soviet Union.) For further readings on Ex-Eastern bloc comics culture: <a href="Serbian_comics" title="wikilink">Serbian comics</a>, <a href="Polish_comics" title="wikilink">Polish comics</a>, <a href="Czech_comics" title="wikilink">Czech comics</a></p>

Luckily Z&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00E1&gt;d was not just a great artist, but also a talented storyteller: these comics came much closer to the medium&lt;U+2019&gt;s own language. He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention. He was invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio &lt;U+2013&gt; due to Hungarian bureaucracy &lt;U+2013&gt; has arrived late. Furthermore the works has been stolen from the festival. By the late seventies the classic three of Hungarian comics disappeared: Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros died in 1975, Seb&lt;U+0151&gt;k died in 1980 and Z&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00E1&gt;d retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics&lt;U+2019&gt; golden age.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time very few foreign comics were allowed to be published for the Hungarian market. The exceptions were mainly comics from the Eastern bloc or comics with socialist/communist background. The exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozaik: The East German <a href="Mosaik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mosaik</a> was first published in 1971 and ran as a monthly comic book series from 1973 until 1990. It became very popular and still has many hardcore fans. The issues were printed in GDR, and according to an anecdote, Hungary gave fruits and vegetables in trade for the Mozaiks. The title returned to the newsstands in 2001 and is still published alongside of many special issues for collectors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pif and Vailant: These were imported from France and sold at newspaper stands. This was allowed because the biweekly magazine belonged to the communist L'Humanit&lt;U+00E9&gt; newspaper group.</li>
<li>In the seventies some French (mainly from Vaillant) and Italian (mainly Bonelli western) comics were published in F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les, Pajt&lt;U+00E1&gt;s, etc.</li>
<li>Danish and Finnish editions of American superhero comics were printed in Hungary&lt;U+2019&gt;s Kossuth nyomda. A large number of these forbidden fruits were sold/traded on flee markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an environment much more liberal, the Hungarian minorities of Yugoslavia published many comics. The most important publisher of the time was Forum Marketprint, which presented <em>Buksi</em> magazine in the sixties. This became so popular, that the Serbo-Croatian version soon followed, and eventually outlived it.</p>

<p>The less harsh tone of the eighties (i.e. <a href="Glasnost" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasnost</a>) brought some changes in the field of comics. Some foreign comics were allowed to be published in Hungarian, not just comics from the <a href="Eastern_Bloc" title="wikilink">Eastern Bloc</a> (e.g. Mozaik) or communist French comics (Vaillant, <a href="Pif_Gadget" title="wikilink">Pif Gadget</a>), but some politically &lt;U+201C&gt;harmless&lt;U+201D&gt; series as <a href="Asterix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asterix</a> and <a href="Lucky_Luke" title="wikilink">Lucky Luke</a> (in Alfa), <a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a> (started in 1987), Miki eg&lt;U+00E9&gt;r (<a href="Mickey_Mouse" title="wikilink">Mickey Mouse</a> from 1988) and Swedish <em>Bobo</em> and <em>G&lt;U+00F3&gt;li&lt;U+00E1&gt;t</em> (both from 1986), <em>Tumak</em>, <em>Pink Panther, Nils Holgerson</em>, etc. One of the most important magazines of the era was Kock&lt;U+00E1&gt;s, that selected stories from Pif and its predecessor Vaillant.</p>
<p><img src="Titkok_bolygoja-fazekas.jpg" title="fig:A page from Titkok bolyg&lt;U+00F3&gt;ja (1982), a fantasy/sci-fi comics by Attila Fazekas" alt="A page from Titkok bolyg&lt;U+00F3&gt;ja (1982), a fantasy/sci-fi comics by Attila Fazekas" /> <img src="Miskati-rusz.jpg" title="fig:A page from Miskati k&lt;U+00F6&gt;zbel&lt;U+00E9&gt;p (1988), a children&#39;s/youth comic book by L&lt;U+00ED&gt;via Rusz" alt="A page from Miskati k&lt;U+00F6&gt;zbel&lt;U+00E9&gt;p (1988), a children&#39;s/youth comic book by L&lt;U+00ED&gt;via Rusz" />Again, comics published for the Hungarian minorities in Yugoslavia ranged on a much larger scale (Hagar, larger selection of Asterix and Lucky Luke, Prince Valiant, Biblical comics etc.). These were popular on both sides of the border, imported both legally and illegally to Hungary.</p>
<p>Most importantly this was the period when the individual comic book and European album formats came into use. This was the case for both Hungarian creations and translations. The two basic formats of the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small (cca. 15 x 21.5 cm), cheap, black and white comic books. These were usually reissues of stories that ran in 4 page installments in F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les. Even the size was the same. Later Attila Fazekas made comics that were published originally in this format. Most notable of these reissues was the Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt; sorozat sequel, that collected then already classic adaptations of Jen&lt;U+0151&gt; Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s novels. Despite the fact that these were drastically reedited by Tibor Cs. Horv&lt;U+00E1&gt;th they were very popular, bringing these stories close to another young generation. Among the comics most loved were P&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros&lt;U+2019&gt; art, that captured Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s absurd and grotesque humor.</li>
<li>Large colored albums. These were mainly Ern&lt;U+0151&gt; Z&lt;U+00F3&gt;r&lt;U+00E1&gt;d&lt;U+2019&gt;s comics. In some cases they were also reissues, but redesigned, colored by the artist himself. They were published in two unanimous series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important, but short comics were published in the sci-fi anthology, <a href="Galaktika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galaktika</a>. Some of today&lt;U+2019&gt;s artists made their first works here (<em>Marabu, Mih&lt;U+00E1&gt;ly Vass, Istv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Fujkin</em>). The anthology also published foreign comics as [[Conan], The Adventures of <a href="Funky_Koval" title="wikilink">Funky Koval</a> (Funky Koval kalandjai by polish <a href="Maciej_Parowski" title="wikilink">Maciej Parowski</a>, J.

<p>In the 1970s and &lt;U+2018&gt;80s some famous cartoonists (<a href="Attila_Dargay" title="wikilink">Attila Dargay</a>, <a href="Marcell_Jankovics" title="wikilink">Marcell Jankovics</a>) made ventures in the comic medium. Both of them were talented comic book creators, but both of them rather considered cartoons as their main field. Jankovics even went as far as publicly despising comics.</p>
<p>During this era comics also infiltrated the underground scene (concert posters, <a href="fanzines" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanzines</a>, <a href="samizdat" class="uri" title="wikilink">samizdat</a> press), a field publicly still unrevealed.</p>

The art shows Fekete&#39;s early style he gave up for a less detailed and more cartoon-like style." />The early nineties were a very chaotic, but exciting and optimistic era in terms of comics. After no one has been told what is and is not to be published, many saw great opportunities in releasing comics. In these years a large variety of comics came into the country (not as direct import, but in the form of translations): all kinds of European, American comics. Unfortunately these companies were more enthusiastic, than strong in capital, and had no experience in the whereabouts of <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a> as such. Therefore most of them disappeared after a few months or years. By 1992 such great series as <em>Men&lt;U+0151&gt; Man&lt;U+00F3&gt;</em> (<a href="Italian_comics" title="wikilink">Italian comics</a> for teenage readers), Krampusz (Italian comics for adult readers), Hepiend Magazin (Conan, <a href="Punisher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Punisher</a>), Vampi (European and American horror, <a href="fantasy_comics" title="wikilink">fantasy</a>, <a href="erotic_comics" title="wikilink">erotic comics</a>) vanished. Besides the inexperience of the small publishing companies, the comics reading audience might not have been ready for these type of comics. In many cases their true value was only discovered in recent years.</p>
<p>This was not the case for <a href="superhero" class="uri" title="wikilink">superhero</a> comics. In the last days of the <a href="People&lt;U+2019&gt;s_Republic_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">People&lt;U+2019&gt;s Republic of Hungary</a> American superhero comics finally were allowed. The first superhero story was published in 1989, in a special issue of Alfa magazine. This was the Revenge of the Living Monolith (A monolit bossz&lt;U+00FA&gt;ja), a Marvel team-up story. Also in 1989, after a few years of publishing foreign children comics (Bobo, G&lt;U+00F3&gt;li&lt;U+00E1&gt;t, Pink Panther, Tumak, Pejk&lt;U+00F3&gt;, etc.) <a href="Semic_Interprint" title="wikilink">Interprint</a> plunged into superhero comics. First <a href="The_Phantom" title="wikilink">The Phantom</a>, than <a href="Spider-Man" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spider-Man</a>. (In 1991 Interprint joined the Swedish Semic group, which resulted in Semic-Interprint.) The company started <a href="Batman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batman</a> in January 1990 and <a href="Superman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superman</a> same year later. DC comics were not as popular as Marvel superheroes, so the titles merged and were made bimonthly in 1992 as <em>&quot;Superman &lt;U+00E9&gt;s Batman&quot;</em>. X-men started in June 1992 and Marvel Extra (a compilation of all sorts of Marvel superhero stories) in February 1993.</p>
<p>Hungarian comic book artists found themselves in a very new and alien situation: while comics were living their heyday, young readers&lt;U+2019&gt; interest drifted from Hungarian comics to the much more modern and spectacular superhero comics. Attila Fazekas who&lt;U+2019&gt;s Star Wars adaptations sold around 200 thousand a decade earlier, now tries every way to remain on the surface. He produced and published his own magazine, <em>Botond</em>. These comic books comprised all kinds of stories, from historical to action. Every issue had a story of Botond, a character based on Hungarian legends and Asterix. He also tried out erotic (or rather porno) comics &lt;U+2013&gt; with surprisingly small success.</p>
<p>With no major outlet, Hungarian comics started to fade. To this day many directly accuse Semic Interprint and its monthly dump of superhero comics for this phenomena. As the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s leading comic book publisher, Semic Interprint never published a Hungarian comic book in these fragile years (cf. after WWII France - and many other West European countries - had an anti-American self-protective law, a foundation of their flourishing comics culture). Others protect it on the basis of free market.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In march 1994 Semic Interprint launched the bimonthly Kret&lt;U+00E9&gt;n (Cretin). This absurd and satirical humor magazine is somewhat like <a href="Mad_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Mad</a> or <a href="Fluide_Glacial" title="wikilink">Fluide Glacial</a>. In this magazine many talented artists introduced themselves to a larger audience (Zsolt H. Garisa, Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n &lt;U+201C&gt;Zerge&lt;U+201D&gt; Varga, Imre &lt;U+201C&gt;Feki&lt;U+201D&gt; Fekete, Csete, Gergely G&lt;U+00F6&gt;nd&lt;U+00F6&gt;cs, etc.). It can be considered the most important and prestigious outlet for Hungarian comics at the time.</p>
<p>F&lt;U+00FC&gt;les and new crossword puzzle magazines are still popular in Hungary, but comics reader&lt;U+2019&gt;s attention has drifted away from these, leaving the collecting of the comics published in these to hardcore, and mostly veteran fans.</p>
<p>In 1996 <a href="Marvel_comics#1990s" title="wikilink">Marvel went bankrupt</a> and drastically raised the royalties collected upon translations, therefore Hungarian Marvel titles were canceled in December 1996 (Marvel Extra) and January 1997 (X-Men). However the most popular title, Csod&lt;U+00E1&gt;latos P&lt;U+00F3&gt;kember (Amazing Spider-Man), managed to survive. In the same year <a href="Semic_Interprint" title="wikilink">Semic Interprint</a> started publishing Spawn as a bimonthly with two stories in each issue. In 1999, after its tenth year, 120th issue the company doubled the magazine&lt;U+2019&gt;s number of pages (from 32 to 76) and price too. Every issue contained three complete Spider-Man stories (The Amazing Spider-Man, Peter Parker Spider-Man, Webspinners Tales of Spider-Man &lt;U+2013&gt; all starting out from #1). The stories did not fulfill the Hungarian needs and the price seemed to be too high, resulting in the canceling of the title at the end of the year, along with Spawn. The bimonthly, not so popular Superman &lt;U+00E9&gt;s Batman managed to continue until December 2001, as the only superhero title published in Hungarian.</p>
<p>In 2001 Csod&lt;U+00E1&gt;latos P&lt;U+00F3&gt;kember has been relaunched, but instead of continuing with Spider-Man continuity, it served a younger audience with the translations of <a href="Ultimate_Spider-Man" title="wikilink">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>. Leaving Kret&lt;U+00E9&gt;n and the bimonthly Star Wars out of account, Semic Interprint shifted to children&lt;U+2019&gt;s audience with other flagship titles such as Dragon Ball (cancelled soon after), Garfield, D&lt;U+00F6&gt;rm&lt;U+00F6&gt;g&lt;U+0151&gt; D&lt;U+00F6&gt;m&lt;U+00F6&gt;t&lt;U+00F6&gt;r. Children comics were the main profile of major publishers like Egmont (Tom &lt;U+00E9&gt;s Jerry, Donald Kacsa magazin) and smaller companies such as Abrafaxe Kft. (Mozaik, later continued by N-Press, than Ratius).</p>
<h3 id="recent-revival-of-comics-2004-">Recent revival of comics (2004-)</h3>
<p>By 2003 a generation reached their adolescence with no substantial comic book intake, and the generation that once grew up on superhero comics was left with hardly any comics since the late nineties. Remaining hardcore fans began to organize into web communities on forums and a new scene developed on the basis of scanlations. In English speaking countries <a href="scanlations" class="uri" title="wikilink">scanlations</a> usually refer to manga, but in Hungary fan translations and lettering started with Marvel superhero type comics, and then moved on to other types. Different websites specialized in different genres, types (European, superhero, independent, manga, underground, etc.). The most notable achievement of the Hungarian scanlating scene was that it brought together the fans, forming a base of comics fandom. Kepregeny.net started out as a scanlating and scanning website, and a center for all kinds of comics fans. Its forum provided a platform for fans and professionals (artists, ex editors, retailers etc.) to meet and discuss all kinds of issues. Many projects were eventually launched from there, and to this day it still is a place for fan talk and professional debate. Throughout the years the forum, news section and the later added article section (a database collecting every comics related article published in the press) made the website grow out its original semi legal content and in 2007 it finally became fully legal with pulling off downloadable comics.</p>
<p>2004 can be regarded as the breakthrough year in comics publishing. In February the Complete <a href="Maus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maus</a> was released by Ulpius-h&lt;U+00E1&gt;z, a larger publishing house. (The first book of Maus has already been published in the early nineties.) Besides the release of the <a href="graphic_novel" title="wikilink">graphic novel</a>, Ulpius organized an exhibition which exposed pages from Maus in Budapest&lt;U+2019&gt;s subway carts, seen by one million passengers a day. The project became successful, and attracted large media attention. This project was timed for the 50th anniversary commemoration of the German occupation in March 1944, resulting in the deportation of 800,000 Hungarian Jews and other minorities. (This also is revealed in the graphic novel.)</p>
<p>Another milestone of the year was the publication of the Belgian album series, <a href="XIII_(comic_book)" title="wikilink">XIII</a>]. This, along with <a href="Largo_Winch" title="wikilink">Largo Winch</a> has already been introduced to the Hungarian audience in 1995 as part of the X-07 black and white series in American comic book format.</p>
<p>That year also brought some changes in Hungarian comics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endre Sarl&lt;U+00F3&gt;s&lt;U+2019&gt; Szigetv&lt;U+00E1&gt;r ostroma (a historical album about the <a href="Battle_of_Szigetv&lt;U+00E1&gt;r" title="wikilink">Turkish siege of Szigetv&lt;U+00E1&gt;r</a> in 1556) was published and sold at newspaper stands. Unfortunately the pages originally composed in landscape format, were reorganized to portrait A4 format and were paired with weak lettering.</li>
<li>Attila Fazekas&lt;U+2019&gt; Botond revived after an 11 year hiatus.</li>
<li>After a long time the first underground comic book anthology, PTSD antol&lt;U+00F3&gt;gia appeared.</li>
<li>A group of graphic artists joined forces as Magyar K&lt;U+00E9&gt;preg&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny Akad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mia (Hungarian Comics Academy &lt;U+2013&gt; a rather self-ironic name).</li>
<li>K&lt;U+00E9&gt;pes Kiad&lt;U+00F3&gt;, the publishing company of P&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros&lt;U+2019&gt; son and grandson started into a series in which the original Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros and Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt; classic comics were rearranged into European styled colored albums. The texts were rewritten, the drawings supplemented and corrected where needed, and colored by the team of Zsolt H. Garisa and Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n &lt;U+201C&gt;Zerge&lt;U+201D&gt; Varga. This series has started in 2003, but 2004 brought larger recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since than many smaller publishers, usually based around one or few fans themselves, made ventures in releasing comics. These companies provide a very broad variety of comics, some specializing on smaller territories (manga, American mainstream), others representing a larger scale. In 2005 most of these companies forged into the <em>Magyar K&lt;U+00E9&gt;preg&lt;U+00E9&gt;nykiad&lt;U+00F3&gt;k Sz&lt;U+00F6&gt;vets&lt;U+00E9&gt;ge</em> (Hungarian Comic Publishers&lt;U+2019&gt; Association), based more on mutual interests and friendship, rather than strict rules and codes. Organizing festivals and fairs can be considered as the organization&lt;U+2019&gt;s biggest success.</p>
<p>Publishers soon realized that in most cases the newspaper market is far from ideal for comics, however it might be feasible on the book market. This however is a phenomena seen in many other comic cultures. In the last few years only three companies made efforts on the newspaper market: <a href="Panini_Comics" title="wikilink">Panini Comics Italy</a> (4, then 2 Marvel titles) and K&lt;U+00E9&gt;pes Kiad&lt;U+00F3&gt; (a black and white budget magazine called <em>Edu&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd fapados k&lt;U+00E9&gt;preg&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny&lt;U+00FA&gt;js&lt;U+00E1&gt;g</em>) both failed at it, however Pesti k&lt;U+00F6&gt;nyv still sends its Lucky Lukes to the newspaper stands. Bookstores have a constantly growing variety on graphic novels, trade paperbacks, albums, etc. This phenomena is still new for many Hungarians, since they were used to searching for comics at the newspaper stands/shops, tobacconists, etc.</p>
<p>In a country with a population around 10 million, these &lt;U+201C&gt;books&lt;U+201D&gt; are published in 2 to 5000 copies, which is extremely low, causing relatively high prices. Despite the low number of copies, comics and the theme of its revival has been a frequent topic of the media. In spite of this, prejudice concerning comics fade very slowly.</p>
<p>Also during this period, comics&lt;U+2019&gt; own offline printed media has been born in the form of semi fanzine-semi professional papers as <em>Panel</em>, <em>Bubor&lt;U+00E9&gt;kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;moz&lt;U+00F3&gt;</em> (Bubble-peeler).</p>
<p>The first significant amount of <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> were published in the last quarter of 2006 and by the end of 2007, it flooded the comics market, being the most popular among them. Unlike the second most popular type of comics &lt;U+2013&gt; superheroes &lt;U+2013&gt; manga fans have their own fan groups, conventions, and are less interested in other type of comics.</p>

<ul>
<li>A: Hungarian comics are much less popular than translations of American (superhero) comics and manga. (In a country, where the most popular titles are published in 2-5000 copies.)</li>
<li>B: Royalties for foreign comics are cheaper, than the sum of writing, penciling, inking, coloring, lettering etc. a new comic book.</li>
<li>C: Devoted publishers can only afford very short stories from professional artists.</li>
<li>D: Publishers can only afford cheaper workforce.</li>
<li>E: Professional artists drift towards advertisement graphics, animation and other territories.</li>
<li>F: Professional artists do not become professional <a href="comics_artists" title="wikilink">comics artists</a>.</li>
<li>G: If artists manage to create comics in their free time, it's either &quot;experimental&quot; or has its faults resulting from lack of experience in the field.</li>
<li>H: Fans are not fulfilled by short, experimental, mediocre comics, and turn their attention to other directions as Hungarian comics.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>However some editors and journalists<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> believe, in Hungary Hungarian comics have the potential of recruiting more comics fans and reaching a cult status. Editor, Antal Bayer speculates in a forum comment: ''&quot;At the same time, I'm convinced that a really &quot;up-to-date&quot; Hungarian comic could reach the cult status, then maintain massive popularity. We've seen how <em>Napirajz</em> moved the people, but we need something more than that for breakthrough. I can hardly wait for the Hungarian comic book, that's received with such enthusiasm as the latest Rejt&lt;U+0151&gt;/Korcsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros reissue.&quot;'' <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
