<p><strong><em>Hulk</em></strong> (also known as <strong><em>The Hulk</em></strong>) is a <a href="2003_in_film" title="wikilink">2003</a> <a href="superhero_film" title="wikilink">superhero film</a> based on the <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional</a> <a href="Marvel_Comics" title="wikilink">Marvel Comics</a> <a href="Hulk_(comics)" title="wikilink">character of the same name</a>. <a href="Ang_Lee" title="wikilink">Ang Lee</a> directed the film, which stars <a href="Eric_Bana" title="wikilink">Eric Bana</a> as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well as <a href="Jennifer_Connelly" title="wikilink">Jennifer Connelly</a>, <a href="Sam_Elliott" title="wikilink">Sam Elliott</a>, <a href="Nick_Nolte" title="wikilink">Nick Nolte</a> and <a href="Josh_Lucas" title="wikilink">Josh Lucas</a>. The film explores the origins of the Hulk, which is mainly attributed to Banner's father's experiments on himself, and passing these genes on to his son.</p>
<p>Development for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be directed by <a href="Joe_Johnston" title="wikilink">Joe Johnston</a> and then <a href="Jonathan_Hensleigh" title="wikilink">Jonathan Hensleigh</a>. More scripts had been written by Hensleigh, <a href="John_Turman" title="wikilink">John Turman</a>, <a href="Michael_France" title="wikilink">Michael France</a>, <a href="Zak_Penn" title="wikilink">Zak Penn</a>, <a href="J._J._Abrams" title="wikilink">J. J.

The film was released with mixed reviews, and was a financial failure at the box office. This eventually lead to the 2008 film <em><a href="The_Incredible_Hulk_(film)" title="wikilink">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> (which is a <a href="reboot_(fiction)" title="wikilink">reboot</a>).</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Brian_Banner" title="wikilink">David Banner</a> is a <a href="genetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">genetics</a> researcher who experiments on himself, trying to improve human DNA. Once his wife gives birth to their son Bruce, David realizes his mutant DNA has been passed on and attempts to find a cure for his son's condition. The government, represented by <a href="&quot;Thunderbolt&quot;_Ross" title="wikilink">Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross</a>, shuts down his research after learning of his dangerous experiments. David, in a fit of rage, causes a massive explosion of the facilities' gamma reactor, and accidentally kills his wife. He is then put into a mental hospital, while 4-year-old Bruce is sent into foster care and adopted, taking on the last name of Krenzler, believing his biological parents are deceased. The events leave Bruce unable to conjure the memories into reality.</p>
<p>Years later, Bruce is a brilliant researcher freshly graduated at the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a>. The <a href="military-industrial_complex" title="wikilink">military-industrial complex</a>, represented by the unscrupulous <a href="Major_Glenn_Talbot" title="wikilink">Major Talbot</a>, becomes interested in the research to build regenerating <a href="soldier" title="wikilink">soldiers</a>. David reappears and begins infiltrating Bruce's life, working as a janitor in the lab building. Ross, now an Army general, also begins to investigate. Ross, the estranged father of Bruce's ex-girlfriend and co-researcher <a href="Betty_Ross" title="wikilink">Betty Ross</a>, becomes concerned both for his daughter's safety around Bruce, but also because Bruce is working in the same field as the father he does not remember.</p>
<p>Bruce succumbs to a scientific experiment accident. Afterwards, we see Bruce sitting in a hospital bed telling Betty that he's never felt better, which she can't fathom due to the fact that the nanomeds have killed everything else they've touched. The radiation has intertwined with Bruce's already-altered DNA. That night, his father confronts him, revealing their relationship and hinting at the mutation inside Bruce. Using Bruce's DNA, he begins experimentation on animals. Soon after, the building rage within him stemming from all of the stresses building up around him activates his gamma-radiated DNA, transforming Bruce into the <a href="Hulk_(comics)" title="wikilink">Hulk</a>.</p>
<p>After the destruction at the lab, Bruce is found unconscious and at home by Betty. Bruce barely remembers his transformation, a sensation similar to birth. Ross arrives, suspicious, and places him under house arrest as well as taking over Bruce and Betty's lab. That night, David phones Bruce and tells him he has unleashed three mutant dogs to Betty's house. Enraged and attacked by Talbot, Bruce transforms again and, after seriously injuring Talbot and his henchmen, fights and kills all three dogs and saves Betty. The next morning, Bruce is tranquilized and taken to an enormous underground base in the desert. Betty tries to convince her father to allow her to attempt to help Bruce control his transformations, but Ross remains extremely skeptical, believing Bruce is &quot;damned&quot; to follow in his father's footsteps. In the meantime, David breaks into the lab and subjects himself to the nanomeds and the gammasphere, gaining the ability to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he can touch.</p>
<p>Talbot, seeing an opportunity to profit from the Hulk's strength and regenerative capability, attacks and taunts Bruce, but fails. Talbot puts him in a sensory deprivation tank and induces a nightmare that triggers his repressed memories and transforms him into the Hulk, eventually leading to the death of Talbot. David confronts Betty and offers to turn himself in. In exchange, he asks to speak to Bruce &quot;one last time.&quot; The Hulk escapes the base in the process. He battles the army in the desert, defeating four tanks and two <a href="RAH-66_Comanche" title="wikilink">Comanche Helicopters</a>, and leaps all the way to <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> to find Betty again. Betty contacts her father and convinces him to take her to meet the Hulk, believing that he needs &quot;a chance to calm down.&quot; Bruce's love for her comes through the Hulk, and he transforms back into his human form. David is allowed to visit the base and talk to Bruce. David, having descended into <a href="megalomania" class="uri" title="wikilink">megalomania</a>, fails to convince Bruce to give him his power. David transforms into a powerful electrical being after biting into a wire and absorbing the energy. Bruce then transforms into the Hulk and battles his father. Both are presumed dead after Ross orders a Gamma Charge Bomb to end the fight, leaving no trace of either men. A year later there have still been numerous sightings of the Hulk. Bruce finds exile in the <a href="Amazon_Rainforest" title="wikilink">Amazon Rainforest</a> as a doctor in a medical camp.</p>

<p>Producers <a href="Avi_Arad" title="wikilink">Avi Arad</a> and <a href="Gale_Anne_Hurd" title="wikilink">Gale Anne Hurd</a> started the development for <em>Hulk</em> in 1990.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> By December 1992 <a href="Marvel_Studios" title="wikilink">Marvel Studios</a> was in discussions with <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal Pictures</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Michael_France" title="wikilink">Michael France</a> and <a href="Stan_Lee" title="wikilink">Stan Lee</a> were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept was to have the Hulk battle <a href="terrorists" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorists</a>, an idea France disliked. <a href="John_Turman" title="wikilink">John Turman</a>, a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts, being heavily influenced by the <em><a href="Tales_to_Astonish#The_Hulk_and_the_Sub-Mariner" title="wikilink">Tales to Astonish</a></em> issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman's script, but nonetheless future screenwriters used many elements brought by Turman.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> By late 1996 Hurd's husband <a href="Jonathan_Hensleigh" title="wikilink">Jonathan Hensleigh</a> signed on as a producers. <a href="Industrial_Light_&amp;_Magic" title="wikilink">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a> was hired to use <a href="computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">computer-generated imagery</a> to create the Hulk.

France was fired before he wrote a single page, but received money from Universal. However, France still wanted to write the script.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of <em><a href="October_Sky" title="wikilink">October Sky</a></em>, paving the way for Hensleigh to have his directing debut. Turman was brought back a second time to write two more drafts, the second of which was rewritten by <a href="Zak_Penn" title="wikilink">Zak Penn</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Turman's script featured the <a href="Leader_(comics)" title="wikilink">Leader</a> and <a href="Rick_Jones_(comics)" title="wikilink">Rick Jones</a>, as well as the canonical atomic explosion origin from the comics.

<h3 id="michael-france">Michael France</h3>
<p>Hensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out, and felt he &quot;wasted nine months in <a href="pre-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-production</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed &quot;Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure it this was a <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a href="adventure_film" title="wikilink">adventure</a>, or a <a href="comedy_film" title="wikilink">comedy</a>, and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a <a href="Jim_Carrey" title="wikilink">Jim Carrey</a> or <a href="Adam_Sandler" title="wikilink">Adam Sandler</a> movie.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> France was writing the script on <a href="fast_track" title="wikilink">fast track</a> from July—September 1999.

<p>France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his &quot;amiable, <a href="nerd" title="wikilink">nerdy</a> genius&quot; incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced <a href="Brian_Banner" title="wikilink">Brian Banner</a>, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> However, he has <a href="anger_management" title="wikilink">anger management</a> issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The &quot;Don't make me angry...&quot; line from the <a href="The_Incredible_Hulk_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">TV series</a> was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the &quot;Gammasphere&quot;, Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the <a href="black_op" title="wikilink">black ops</a> made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999—January 2000.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Michael_Tolkin" title="wikilink">Michael Tolkin</a> and <a href="David_Hayter" title="wikilink">David Hayter</a> rewrote the script afterwards, despite positive response from the producers over France's script.

<p>Schamus was still rewriting the script in October 2001.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In early 2002, as filming was underway, Michael France read all the scripts for the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America</a>, to determine who would get final credit. France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, &quot;James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> France, Turman and Schamus received final credit.
