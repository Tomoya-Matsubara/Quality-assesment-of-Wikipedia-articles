<p>A <strong><em>parashah</em></strong> (<a href="Hebrew_(language)" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>: &quot;portion,&quot; plural: <em>parashot</em> or <em>parashiyyot</em>) is a section of a biblical book in the <a href="masoretic_text" title="wikilink">masoretic text</a> of the <a href="Tanakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanakh</a> (<a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Hebrew Bible</a>). Such sections are designated by various types of spacing between them, as found in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Torah_scroll" title="wikilink">Torah scrolls</a></li>
<li>Scrolls of the books of <a href="Nevi&#39;im" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevi'im</a> or <a href="Ketuvim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketuvim</a> (especially <a href="five_megillot" title="wikilink">megillot</a>)</li>
<li>Masoretic codices from the Middle Ages</li>
<li>Printed editions of the <a href="masoretic_text" title="wikilink">masoretic text</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The division of the text into <em>parashot</em> for the biblical books is independent of chapter and verse numbers, which are not part of the masoretic tradition. <em>Parashot</em> are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.</p>
<p>Incorrect division of the text into <em>parashot</em>, either by indicating a <em>parashah</em> in the wrong place or by using the wrong spacing technique, <a href="halakhah" title="wikilink">halakhically</a> invalidates a <a href="Torah_scroll" title="wikilink">Torah scroll</a> according to <a href="Maimonides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maimonides</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The division of <em>parashot</em> found in the modern-day <a href="Torah_scroll" title="wikilink">Torah scrolls</a> of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in <a href="Mishneh_Torah" title="wikilink">Mishneh Torah</a>, <em>Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls</em>, chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the <em>parashot</em> for the Torah on the <a href="Aleppo_Codex" title="wikilink">Aleppo Codex</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The division of <em>parashot</em> for the books of <a href="Nevi&#39;im" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevi'im</a> and <a href="Ketuvim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketuvim</a> was never completely standardized in printed Hebrew bibles and handwritten scrolls, though important attempts were made to document it and create fixed rules.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-section-divisions">Purpose of the section divisions</h2>
<p>A <em>parashah</em> break creates a textual pause, roughly analogous to a modern <a href="paragraph" class="uri" title="wikilink">paragraph</a> break. Such a pause usually has one of the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>In most cases, a new <em>parashah</em> begins where a new topic or a new thought is clearly indicated in the biblical text.</li>
<li>In many places, however, the <em>parashah</em> divisions are used even in places where it is clear that no new topic begins, in order to highlight a special verse by creating a textual pause before it or after it (or both).</li>
<li>A special example of #2 is for lists: The individual elements in many biblical lists are separated by <em>parashah</em> spacing of one type or another.</li>
</ol>
<p>To decide exactly where a new topic or thought begins within a biblical text involves a degree of subjectivity on the part of the reader. This subjective element may help explain differences amongst the various masoretic codices in some details of the section divisions (though it should be emphasized that their degree of conformity is high). It may also sometimes explain why certain verses that might seem like introductions to a new topic lack a section division, or why such divisions appear in places where no new topic is indicated.</p>
<p>For this reason, at times the <em>parashah</em> divisions may contribute to biblical <a href="exegesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">exegesis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-the-section-divisions">History of the section divisions</h2>

<p>The idea of spacing between portions is mentioned in midrashic literature, and the idea of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; portions is mentioned in the Talmud. Early masoretic lists detailing the Babylonian tradition include systematic and detailed discussion of exactly where portions begin and which type they are.</p>
<p>Tiberian masoretic codices have similar but not identical <em>parashah</em> divisions throughout the Bible. Unlike the Babylonian mesorah, however, Tiberian masoretic notes never mention the <em>parashah</em> divisions or attempt to systematize them. This is related to the fact that the Babylonian lists are independent compositions, while the Tiberian notes are in the margins of the biblical text itself, which shows the <em>parashot</em> in a highly visible way.</p>
<p>In the centuries following the Tiberian mesorah, there were ever-increasing efforts to document and standardize the details of the <em>parashah</em> divisions, especially for the Torah, and even for <a href="Nevi&#39;im" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevi'im</a> and <a href="Ketuvim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketuvim</a> as time went on.</p>

An &quot;open portion&quot; is roughly similar to a modern paragraph: The text of the previous portion ends before the end of the column (leaving a space at the end of the line), and the new &quot;open&quot; portion starts at the beginning of the next line (but with no indentation). A &quot;closed portion&quot;, on the other hand, leaves a space in the <em>middle</em> of the line of text, where the previous portion ends before the space, and the next portion starts after it, towards the end of the line of text.</p>
<p>An &quot;open portion&quot; (<em>petuhah</em>) is often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter &quot;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&quot; (<em>peh</em>), and a &quot;closed portion&quot; (<em>setumah</em>) with the Hebrew letter &quot;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&quot; (<em>samekh</em>).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Rough English equivalents are &quot;P&quot; and &quot;S&quot; respectively.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In masoretic codices and in medieval scrolls, these two spacing techniques allowed for a larger range of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>An &quot;open portion&quot; <em>always started at the beginning of a new line</em>. This could happen the way described above, but also by leaving a <em>blank line</em> between the two portions, thus allowing the previous portion to sometimes entirely fill its last line of text.</li>
<li>A &quot;closed portion&quot; <em>never began at the beginning of a line</em>. This could happen as in modern scrolls (a space in the middle of a line), but also by the previous portion ending before the end of the line, and the new portion beginning on the next line after an indentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most printed Hebrew bibles today represent the <em>parashot</em> using the more limited techniques found in typical modern Torah scrolls: A space in the middle of a line for a closed portion, and beginning at the start of the next line for an open portion (not a blank line). A notable exception is <em>The Jerusalem Crown</em> (The Bible of the <a href="Hebrew_University" title="wikilink">Hebrew University</a> of Jerusalem, 2000), whose typography and layout is fashioned after the Aleppo codex, and follows the medieval spacing techniques for <em>parashah</em> divisions by leaving an empty line for {P} and starts {S} on a new line with an indentation.</p>
<p>Medieval Ashkenazic sources beginning with the <a href="Mahzor_Vitry" title="wikilink">Mahzor Vitry</a> also refer to a third spacing technique called a <em>parashah sedurah</em>. This involved starting a new <em>parashah</em> at the same point in the line where the previous <em>parashah</em> ended on the line above.</p>
<h2 id="halakhic-significance">Halakhic significance</h2>
<h3 id="validity-of-scrolls">Validity of Scrolls</h3>
<p>According to the ruling of Maimonides (<em>Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls</em> 10:1), any error regarding a <em>parashah</em> completely invalidates a Torah scroll. This includes a <em>parashah</em> in the wrong place, of the wrong type, or a missing <em>parashah</em>.</p>
<p>However, there is also a responsum by Maimonides<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in which he ruled that one may recite a blessing over reading from an <em>invalid</em> scroll, based on the reasoning that the commandment is in the reading itself, not in the text being read from.</p>
<p>Maimonides' strict ruling that any error in the <em>parashot</em> completely invalidates a Torah scroll led to a major <a href="halakhah" title="wikilink">halakhic</a> debate that continues to this day.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Among those who ruled against Maimonides' stricture in practice were his son, <a href="Avraham_son_of_Rambam" title="wikilink">Rabbi Abraham</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Rabbi <a href="Menachem_Meiri" title="wikilink">Menachem ha-Meiri</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Maharam Halava,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Mahari Mintz<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and Rabbi <a href="Ovadia_Yosef" title="wikilink">Ovadia Yosef</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>All of the above authorities rule that a scroll containing <em>parashot</em> based on alternative scribal traditions that disagree with Maimonides' list of <em>parashot</em> (<em>Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls</em>, chapter 8) is nevertheless a valid scroll. However, even according to the lenient opinion, a blatant error with no source in any scribal tradition invalidates a Torah scroll.</p>
<h3 id="rules-and-customs-for-public-reading">Rules and customs for public reading</h3>
<p>When a section of the Torah is read in public from a <a href="Torah_scroll" title="wikilink">scroll</a> as part of the synagogue service, the sections are often divided in ways that take the <em>parashah</em> divisions into account, but there is no hard and fast rule for this.</p>
<p>One basic <a href="halakhic" class="uri" title="wikilink">halakhic</a> rule for public reading is that no less than three verses at a time be read. As a corollary to this, there is a specific rule regarding <em>parashot</em>: One may not leave off reading less than three verses before the end of a <em>parashah</em>, nor may one end off reading by starting a new <em>parashah</em> but leaving off less than three verses from its beginning.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The sections from <a href="nevi&#39;im" class="uri" title="wikilink">nevi'im</a> that are read as <a href="haftarot" class="uri" title="wikilink">haftarot</a> are based on custom. At times, some of these customs choose the exact beginning or end of a <a href="haftarah" class="uri" title="wikilink">haftarah</a> because it coincides with a <em>parashah</em> division.</p>
<h2 id="parashot-in-the-torah">Parashot in the Torah</h2>
<p>Due to the influence of <a href="Maimonides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maimonides</a>, the <em>parashah</em> divisions in the Torah have become highly standardized, and there is close to exact agreement amongst Torah scrolls, printed Jewish bibles, and similar online texts.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The following list thus presents the parashah divisions as found in (a) modern <a href="Sefer_Torah" title="wikilink">Torah scrolls</a>, (b) <a href="Maimonides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maimonides</a>' <a href="Mishneh_Torah" title="wikilink">Mishneh Torah</a>, and (c) the <a href="Aleppo_Codex" title="wikilink">Aleppo Codex</a> (based on several witnesses besides Maimonides to the <em>parashot</em> in its missing parts). Rare inconsistencies between these three sources are explained in footnotes.</p>
<p>The list is constructed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only breaks <em>between</em> two sections are listed: Any open or closed <em>parashah</em> break, {P} or {S}, must always appear <em>between</em> two biblical sections. The symbols {P} and {S} always indicate the status of the <em>following</em> section. In Genesis, for instance, <strong>{S} 5:32-6:4 {P}</strong> indicates a <em>closed</em> section (<em>setumah</em>) because it <strong>begins</strong> with {S}. Therefore, no section break is indicated before the <em>first</em> portion of a biblical book, or after its <em>last</em> portion.</li>
<li>The five books of the <a href="Torah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torah</a> have been broken down into their <a href="Weekly_Torah_portion" title="wikilink">weekly Torah readings</a> for convenience.</li>
<li>Special series of <em>parashot</em> used for special types of text (such as chronologies, lists, step-by-step sequences, repeating formulas) are indicated.</li>
<li>When a <em>parashah</em> ignores a chapter break, this is indicated for convenience by spelling out the exact verses from each chapter found in that parashah; for instance: {P} 32:4-33;33:1-17 {S}. This system allows for immediate calculation of the number verses in the <em>parashah</em> and also for easier comparison between the <em>parashot</em> and the chapter divisions.</li>
<li>Variations found in alternative masoretic traditions (such as in the <a href="Leningrad_Codex" title="wikilink">Leningrad Codex</a>) are provided separately at the end of each book.</li>
<li>Unusual data (such as an unusually lengthy <em>parashah</em>) is underlined to draw special attention, followed by a parenthetical note identifying the contents of the <em>parashah</em> at hand.</li>
<li>The first words of a <em>parashah</em> are sometimes provided in Hebrew for clarity, especially for <em>parashot</em> that appear within a verse. A prominent example is for the Ten Commandments. The titles of prominent <em>parashot</em> mentioned rabbinic literature are also sometimes given.</li>
</ul>
<p>Symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>{P} = <em>parashah <strong>p</strong>etuhah</em> (&quot;open portion&quot;), typically resembles a new <strong>p</strong>aragraph</li>
<li>{S} = <em>parashah <strong>s</strong>etumah</em> (&quot;closed portion&quot;), typically represented as a blank <strong>s</strong>pace in the middle of a line</li>
<li>{-} = no <em>parashah</em> break indicated</li>
<li>{SONG} = Special format for songs; details of the special layout will be described in separate sections.</li>

<h3 id="layout-of-psalms-proverbs-job">Layout of Psalms, Proverbs, Job</h3>
<p>The three <a href="biblical_poetry" title="wikilink">poetic</a> books of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job are collectively knows as <em>Sifrei Emet</em> (see the article on <a href="Ketuvim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketuvim</a>). These three books share a unique system of <a href="cantillation" class="uri" title="wikilink">cantillation</a> unlike that of the other 21 books in <a href="Tanakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanakh</a>, a system designed to highlight the <a href="parallelism" title="wikilink">parallelisms</a> in their verses.</p>
<p>In the Tiberian masoretic codices, the unique system of cantillation for <em>Sifrei Emet</em> is complemented by a scribal layout unlike the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, <em>Sifrei Emet</em> are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, followed by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin. Although there is ample evidence that the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of space limitations. Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In poetic layout, <em>parashah</em> divisions are typically indicated by a blank line for an open <em>parashah</em>. The gaps in the middle of lines are not considered <em>parashah</em> divisions, and each scribe formatted the verses as he saw fit for aesthetic and practical reasons. An exception to this rule, however, is for the introductory titles of many individual psalms which are followed by formal <em>parashah</em> breaks, often by continuing the text at the beginning of the next line. These formal breaks will be indicated in the list of <em>parashot</em> for Psalms.</p>
<p>The special poetic cantillation and layout are <em>not</em> implemented for the narrative opening and conclusion of the book of Job (1:1-3:1 and 42:7-17).</p>
<h3 id="psalms">Psalms</h3>
<p>The Aleppo Codex leaves two empty lines between the five Books of Psalms (following psalms 41, 72, 89, 106). Otherwise there is one blank line between each two psalms, the standard way of indicating an open <em>parashah</em> break {P} in poetic layout.</p>
<p>There is no break at all, however, between psalms 114-115, which were apparently considered a single psalm by the scribes. Psalm 119, which has sets of eight verses for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, has an open <em>parashah</em> break (a blank line) between each set of eight verses.</p>
<p>The titles of individual Psalms have formal rules. Symbols for representing these rules are as follows, based on examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 {-} = Psalm 1 has no formal title. The entire psalm is written in regular poetic layout.</li>
<li>3:1a {S/T} = <strong>Closed</strong> <em>parashah</em> within <strong>title</strong> verse of psalm. The title of psalm 3 is more than minimal, an entire verse containing more than one <a href="hemistich" class="uri" title="wikilink">hemistich</a>. There is a <strong>closed</strong> <em>parashah</em> division after the first hemistich. In masoretic manuscripts, this gap in the middle of the first title verse often closely resembles the poetic layout of the body of the psalm following the title verse.</li>
<li>4:1 {P} = The first full verse of psalm 4 is a title followed by an open <em>parashah</em> break (text of the body of the psalm starts at the beginning of the next line).</li>
<li>11:1a {P} = The beginning of the first verse of psalm 11 is a title, followed by an open <em>parashah</em> break in the middle of the verse (text of the body of the psalm starts at the beginning of the next line). Besides formal titles, this form is also found after the word &quot;halleluyah&quot; at the beginning of a number of psalms (e.g. 106).</li>
<li>15a {S} = A closed <em>parashah</em> division following a title at the beginning of the first verse of the psalm. This is also occasionally found for a full-verse title, e.g. psalm 108:1 {P}.</li>
<li>26 {-/T} The beginning of the first verse is a title, but there is no <em>parashah</em> division.</li>

<p><u><strong>II. Poetic Disputations:</strong></u> The disputations, which constitute the bulk of the book of Job, employ the special poetic layout in common with Psalms and Proverbs, along its associated poetic <a href="cantillation" class="uri" title="wikilink">cantillation</a>. In Tiberian masoretic codices, the formal title of each individual speech appears in the center of its line, while the body of the reply appears in poetic form (as in Psalms and Proverbs). The break between the title and the body is considered an open <em>parashah</em>, and these titles appear in bold. Blank lines as open <em>parashot</em> are also used occasionally, and these are noted as {P}.</p>

<h3 id="esther">Esther</h3>
<p>The book of Esther is traditionally read by Jews on the holiday of <a href="Purim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Purim</a> from a handwritten scroll on parchment that must be <a href="#Validity_of_Scrolls" title="wikilink">halakhically valid</a>. This means that the rules of open and closed <em>parashot</em> are of more practical relevance for Esther than for any other book in <a href="Nevi&#39;im" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevi'im</a> or <a href="Ketuvim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ketuvim</a>. Despite this&lt;U+2014&gt;or perhaps because of the large numbers of scrolls of Esther that have been written, and the attention that has been paid to the problem by rabbis and scribes&lt;U+2014&gt;manuscripts of Esther and opinions about how they should be written betray a relatively large number of discrepancies regarding the <em>parashah</em> divisions.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, Rabbi <a href="Shlomo_Ganzfried" title="wikilink">Shlomo Ganzfried</a> published a manual for scribes called <em>Keset ha-Sofer</em>, in which he follows the rule that all <em>parashot</em> in Esther are closed {S} (<em>Keset ha-Sofer</em> 28:5).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This is currently the dominant tradition for <a href="Ashkenazi_Jews" title="wikilink">Ashkenazic</a> and <a href="Sephardi_Jews" title="wikilink">Sephardic</a> <em>megillot</em> (scrolls of <a href="Book_of_Esther" title="wikilink">Esther</a>) today. But the Tiberian masoretic codices contain both open and closed portions. Also, Yemenite scribes did not entirely adopt the tradition of closed portions, leaving the divisions in many scrolls of Esther similar to what is found in the masoretic codices.</p>
<p>Ganzfried ruled that a scroll of Esther with open portions is invalid, but added that &quot;some authorities validate&quot; it (<em>Keset ha-Sofer</em> 28:5).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> When discussing these authorities in his additional notes,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Ganzfried cites a list open <em>parashot</em> found in the book <em>Orhot Hayyim</em>, and concludes: &quot;And even though our custom is that all of these are closed, it nevertheless seems that if some or all of these are open one may read from the scroll with a blessing.&quot; These have been listed in the chart below below under at &quot;OH&quot; under <em>Keset ha-Sofer</em>, and they are very similar to what is found in the Tiberian masoretic codices.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Most printed Jewish bibles, even those based on manuscripts, show the flow of text in Esther according to the widespread tradition based on <em>Keset ha-Sofer</em> (only closed <em>parashot</em>). Such editions include the <em>Koren</em> edition (Jerusalem, 1962), Breuer's first edition (Jerusalem, 1982) and Dotan's editions (which are otherwise based upon the Leningrad Codex). The flow of text in such bibles is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1:1-8 {S} 1:9-12 {S} 1:13-15 {S} 1:16-22 {S} 2:1-4 {S} 2:5-20 {S} 2:21-23 {S} 3:1-7 {S} 3:8-15 {S} 4:1-17;5:1-14 {S} 6:1-14;7:1-4 {S} 7:5-8 {S} 7:9-10 {S} 8:1-2 {S} 8:3-6 {S} 8:7-14 {S} 8:15-17;9:1-6</li>

</ul>
<p>Bibles that show the <em>parashot</em> in Esther based upon a reconstruction of the Aleppo Codex include two editions following the Breuer method (<em>Horev</em> and <em>The Jerusalem Crown</em>). The flow of text in such bibles is as follows:</p>

Each such &quot;song&quot; is formatted in its own exact way, though there are similarities between them. These sections include:</p>

<h3 id="hamans-sons">Haman's Sons</h3>

<p>Esther 9:7-9 lists Haman's ten sons in three consecutive verses (three names in 7, three in 8, and four in 9). Each name is preceded by the Hebrew particle &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;. The {SONG} format for this list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last word of 9:6 (&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;) is written at the beginning of a new line at the right margin. This will be the first line of text in {SONG} format.</li>
<li>The first word of 9:7 (the Hebrew particle &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;) is written at the end of the first line in {SONG} at the left margin. A gap is thus left between &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt; and &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; which forms a closed <em>parashah</em> division {S}.</li>
<li>In the next ten lines of text, the ten names of the sons of Haman appear one after another in the beginning of each line at the right margin, under the word &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;. There are thus a total of eleven lines of text in {SONG} format, the first beginning with &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt; and the ten following lines with the names of Haman's sons.</li>
<li>The word &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; appears at the end of each line text (left margin), except for the 11th and final line in {SONG} format, which ends with the first word of 9:10 (&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The {SONG} format described here originated in the typically narrow columns of the Tiberian masoretic codices, in which a line of text containing only two words at opposite margins with a gap between them appears similar to a standard closed <em>parashah</em>. However, in many later scrolls the columns are much wider, such that lines with single words at opposite margins create a huge gap in the middle. For this reason, in many scrolls these eleven lines are written in very large letters, so that the gap will not appear unreasonable.</p>

<li id="fn2">Though initially doubted by <a href="Umberto_Cassuto" title="wikilink">Umberto Cassuto</a>, this has become the established position in modern scholarship. As Goshen-Gottstein, Penkower, and Ofer have shown, Cassuto's doubts were based upon apparent discrepancies he noted between the <em>parashah</em> divisions in the <a href="Aleppo_Codex" title="wikilink">Aleppo Codex</a> and those recorded by Maimonides. However, the most striking of these apparent discrepancies are rooted in the faulty manuscripts and printed editions of Maimonides that Cassuto consulted (as noted in his personal journals), while the remaining cases can be reasonably explained as differing interpretations of very small spaces in the Aleppo Codex. Furthermore, the best manuscripts of Maimonides describe highly unusual implementations of spacing techniques that are found in no other masoretic manuscript besides the Aleppo Codex. Full explanations of each individual discrepancy appear in the notes to this article.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn3">The abbreviations are most often used in Hebrew editions of the Bible with commentaries, and in older one-volume editions of the <a href="Tanakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanakh</a> published through the first half of the 20th century. Though most current editions use the actual spacing techiques instead of the abbreviations, they are still used some in one-volume editions, most prominently in <a href="Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia" title="wikilink">BHS</a>.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn6">An English-language survey of the halakhic sources that deal with discrepancies in the transmission of details in the <a href="masoretic_text" title="wikilink">masoretic text</a> of the Torah, regarding both its spelling (letter-text) and its <em>parashah</em> divisions, may be found in Barry Levy's <em>Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible text in Jewish Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 2001).

<li id="fn11"><em>Yehaveh Da'at</em> VI:56. Basing himself on previous authorities who disputed Maimonides ruling entirely, in addition to Maimonides' own ruling that a blessing may be recited upon reading from an invalid Torah Scroll, Rabbi Yosef permits <a href="Ashkenazi_Jews" title="wikilink">Ashkenazic</a> and <a href="Sephardi_Jews" title="wikilink">Sephardic Jews</a> to recite a blessing upon reading from a <a href="Yemenite_Jews" title="wikilink">Yemenite</a> Torah Scroll. Yemenite scrolls differ from both Ashkenazic and Sephardic scrolls for exactly one <em>parashah</em> division: an open section at Leviticus 7:22 (Yemen) instead of at 7:28 (Ashkenaz and Sepharad). Yemenite scrolls also differ regarding certain spellings (exactly 9 letters), while Ashkenazic and Sephardic scrolls are identical in all of these details.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn12">The talmudic source for this is <em>Megillah</em> 22a. In later halakhic literature, these rules are discussed in <em><a href="Orah_Hayyim" title="wikilink">Orah Hayyim</a></em> 138.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn14"><em>Parashat Vayechi</em> is the only one of the <a href="Weekly_Torah_portion" title="wikilink">weekly Torah readings</a> whose opening verse (Genesis 47:28) is not the beginning of an open or a closed section. Its <em>parashot</em> are thus listed here sequentially along with those of the previous weekly reading.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn15"></li>
<li id="fn16">Numerous testimonies verify that the Aleppo codex had a closed section at 20:13b (&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt; &lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; &lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05DA&gt;). Though this data does not agree with what is found in several editions of Maimonides' <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, it accords with the original reading of Maimonides based on early manuscripts and testimonies. See Penkower, Maimonides, pp. 50-64 (at length); Ofer, Cassutto, p. 326; Ofer, Yelin, p. 306.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn17">For Exodus 34:1, &lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;-&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05DA&gt;, the vast majority of accurate Tiberian manuscripts have {S} here instead of {P} (the latter is as listed by Maimonides and found in current Torah scrolls). Testimony about the text of the Aleppo codex when it was still intact (by Kimhi) reveals that the form of the <em>parashah</em> at this point was a line of text that didn't reach the end of the column, followed at 34:1 by a line that began close to the beginning of the column. Identifying the type of <em>parashah</em> in such a context depends on whether the reader considers there to be a significant gap at the beginning of the line (in which case it is <em>setumah</em>) or does not consider the gap to be significant (in which case it is <em>petuhah</em>). This form of <em>parashah</em> is often indicated by a very small indentation in the extant parts of the Aleppo Codex, sometimes no wider than the space of one or two letters. Therefore, Penkower (p. 51 n. 125) and Ofer (pp. 306-307) suggest that Maimonides judged 34:1 to start at the beginning of its line without a significant gap, and was thus followed in later Torah scrolls. Other observers noted it as <em>setumah</em> (Kimhi, Sithon) or wrote conflicting notations (Amadi).<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn18"></li>
<li id="fn19">Ashkenazic and Sephardic Torah scrolls lack an open portion at 7:22 (&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;) while Yemenite scrolls have one. Conversely, Yemenite scrolls lack an open portion at 7:28 (&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05E7&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;) while Ashkenazic and Sephardic scrolls have one. This situation derives from Maimonides' ambiguous formulation in <em>Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls</em>, chapter 8, where he lists a series of six consecutive open <em>parashot</em> at this point in Leviticus, one of them beginning with the words &quot;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&quot; (&quot;The Lord spoke to Moses... Speak to the children of Israel...&quot;). However, there are actually <em>two</em> places where this is found (Leviticus 7:22 and 7:28), and it is unclear which of them Maimonides was referring to. Thus, the scrolls that have a section break at 7:22 and those with a break at 7:28 are both implementing Maimonides' ambiguous formulation in two different ways. How this formulation by Maimonides accords with the Aleppo Codex has been discussed at length by Ofer (Cassuto, pp. 328-330) and Penkower (<em>New Evidence</em>, pp. 76-90). If the Aleppo Codex was indeed missing a <em>parashah</em> break at either 7:22 or 7:28, that would be unique among the 71 occurrences of &quot;The Lord spoke to Moses...&quot; in the Torah. Furthermore, all other Tiberian masoretic manuscripts have <em>parashot</em> in both places. Available data on this now-missing part of the codex is as follows: Rabbi Judah Ityah, who examined the codex to answer questions posed by <a href="Umberto_Cassuto" title="wikilink">Umberto Cassuto</a>, reported that there were open <em>parashah</em> breaks at <em>both</em> 7:22 and 7:28. Earlier, Rabbi Samuel Vital (Responsa <em>Be'er Mayyim Hayyim</em> 27) also confirmed an open <em>parashah</em> at 7:22. Amadi, however, wrote two opposing notes at 7:22&lt;U+2014&gt;that a <em>parashah</em> break is lacking and that the &quot;Codex of Ezra&quot; has a <em>parashah</em> here&lt;U+2014&gt;which apparently refer to two different codices but it is unclear which ones. Ofer deals with the evidence by assuming that Ityah's report was correct and that Maimonides, in the process of adding sums to the final version of his list of <em>parashot</em> for <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, counted &quot;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;... &lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&quot; once instead of twice. Penkower prefers an alternative explanation, namely that there was a small space at the end of the line preceding 7:22 which Maimonides did not consider significant, but which other witnesses thought indicated an open <em>parashah</em> break (pp. 79-80). Modern editions based on the Aleppo Codex show these <em>parashot</em> as follows: Breuer's first edition, published before most of this evidence became available, shows a break only at 7:28 (following the Yemenite tradition). His two later editions (<em>Horev</em> and <em>Jerusalem Crown</em>) show breaks at both 7:22 and 7:28, noting in the margin that &quot;the scrolls of Ashkenaz and Sepharad&quot; or &quot;the scrolls of Yemen&quot; lack a break in either place. The Feldheim <em>Simanim</em> edition shows a break only at 7:28, keeping to the tradition of Ashkenaz and Sepharad.<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn20"></li>
<li id="fn21"></li>
<li id="fn22"></li>
<li id="fn23">Deuteronomy 27:20 is the only one in a series of verses beginning with &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; (&quot;cursed&quot;) not preceded by a closed break in Maimonides' list of <em>parashot</em> (and hence in current Torah scrolls). But other Tiberian masoretic codices have {S} here as for the other verses in the series, while testimonies about the Aleppo Codex from when it was still intact are conflicted. Ofer (pp. 307-8) suggests that since 27:19 has more words than usual for this series of similarly constructed verses, its relative length resulted in a very small space between 27:19 and 27:20 in the narrow columns of the Aleppo Codex, a space which Maimonides interpreted as no more than the space between words and not a closed section break, while other readers evaluated it as a closed section break.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn24">The word <em>ladonai</em> appears at the beginning of a line followed by a space and then the first place-name (<em>le-Ashdod</em>) at the end of the line (left side of the column). Each subsequent occurrence of &quot;one&quot; {<em>ehad</em>) appears below <em>ladonai</em> at the beginning of a line followed by a space, with the place-names at the end of the line (left side of the column).<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn25">The thirteen occurences of <em>la-asher</em> or <em>vela-asher</em> (3 each in 30:27-30 and once at the beginning of 30:31) are arranged above each other at the end of each line (left end of the column), with the appropriate place-names following at the beginning of the next line (right side of each column) and a space in the middle of the line. Some modern editions follow the same principle with different layout by presenting place names followed by <em>two</em> columns of <em>vela-asher</em> on each line.<a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn26">The closed portions found in the Aleppo Codex for this list mostly appear in the <em>middle</em> of its narrow colums, leaving just a single word (or a short phrase) at the beginning and end of each line.<a href="#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn27">Ofer, Yellin, p. 320 and p. 332 n. 1.<a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn28">The Aleppo Codex has no break at all where 2 Kings begins in the Greek textual tradition; text continues on the very same line with no interruption (see the relevant image at <a href="http://aleppocodex.org/">aleppocodex.org</a>). In the Leningrad codex there is a closed <em>parashah</em> break where 2 Kings begins, such that in printed editions reflecting that tradition, text continues at the end of the same line after a gap.<a href="#fnref28" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn29">The Leningrad codex has an open section at 16:7 (&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt; &lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05D6&gt;), but Kimhi did not note any <em>parashah</em>. The possibility that Kimhi erred by neglecting to note a <em>parashah</em> at 16:7 is lessened by the fact that <a href="Codex_Cairensis" title="wikilink">Codex Cairensis</a> also lacks a <em>parashah</em> at this point (Ofer, Yellin, p. 332 n. 1). For this reason Breuer's editions based on the Aleppo Codex and Kimhi's notes (<em>Horev</em> and <em>The Jerusalem Crown</em>) do not show a <em>parashah</em> at 16:7. Finfer similarly does not record this verse in his list of <em>parashot</em> (p. 130), and thus no break is shown in the <em>Koren</em> edition. However, the volume of <em>Mikraot Gedolot Haketer</em> on Kings does show an open <em>parashah</em> break {P} at 16:7 as found in the Leningrad Codex.<a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn30">These include 29:9 (&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;) to 31:34 (&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt;); 32:1 (&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;) to 32:5 (&lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;); 32:8 (&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;) to 32:12 (&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;); 32:14 (&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;) to 32:19 (&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DA&gt;); 32:21 (&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;) to 32:24. However, a few words from 32:4-5 and 32:24 remain.<a href="#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn31">Ofer, Yellin, p. 320 and p. 332 n. 1.<a href="#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn32">The Leningrad codex has a closed section break {S} at 31:17 (&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;), but Kimhi did not note any <em>parashah</em>. The possibility that Kimhi erred by neglecting to note a <em>parashah</em> at 31:17 is lessened by the fact that <a href="Codex_Cairensis" title="wikilink">Codex Cairensis</a> also lacks a <em>parashah</em> at this point, as well as the fact that Finfer records lack of a <em>parashah</em> break here in most manuscripts (Ofer, Yellin, p. 332 n. 1). For this reason Breuer's editions based on the Aleppo Codex and Kimhi's notes (<em>Horev</em> and <em>The Jerusalem Crown</em>) do not show a <em>parashah</em> at 31:17, nor does a break appear in the <em>Koren</em> edition based on Finfer's list. However, Finfer does note that &quot;a few manuscripts&quot; have {S} here (p. 133).<a href="#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
