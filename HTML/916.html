<p>The <strong>Colorado River</strong> is the principal river of the <a href="American_Southwest" title="wikilink">southwestern</a> <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and northwest <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. The  river drains an expansive, arid <a href="drainage_basin" title="wikilink">watershed</a> that encompasses parts of seven U.S. and two Mexican states. Rising in the central <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> in the U.S., the river flows generally southwest across the <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateau</a> before reaching <a href="Lake_Mead" title="wikilink">Lake Mead</a> on the <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a> line, where it turns south towards the international border. After entering Mexico, the Colorado forms a large <a href="River_delta" title="wikilink">delta</a>, emptying into the <a href="Gulf_of_California" title="wikilink">Gulf of California</a> between <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a> and <a href="Sonora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sonora</a>.</p>
<p>Known for its dramatic canyons and whitewater rapids, the Colorado is a vital source of water for agricultural and urban areas in the southwestern desert lands of North America.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams, reservoirs and aqueducts, which furnish irrigation and municipal water supply for almost 40 million people both inside and outside the watershed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Colorado's large flow and steep gradient are used for generating <a href="hydroelectricity" title="wikilink">hydroelectric power</a>, and its major dams regulate <a href="peaking_power" title="wikilink">peaking power</a> demands in much of the <a href="Intermountain_West" title="wikilink">Intermountain West</a>. Since the mid-20th century, intensive water consumption has dried the lower  of the river such that it no longer reaches the sea except in years of heavy runoff.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning with small bands of nomadic <a href="hunter-gatherer" title="wikilink">hunter-gatherers</a>, <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large, sedentary agricultural civilizations, which may have been some of the most sophisticated indigenous cultures in North America. These societies are believed to have collapsed due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the river basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> first entered the Colorado River watershed in the 16th century, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence from Spain in 1821. Early contact between foreigners and natives was generally limited to the <a href="North_American_fur_trade" title="wikilink">fur trade</a> in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.</p>
<p>After the Colorado River basin became part of the U.S. in 1846, the river's course was still largely unknown, and the whereabouts of its headwaters and mouth were still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19th century, of which one was the first to run the rapids of the <a href="Grand_Canyon" title="wikilink">Grand Canyon</a>, led by <a href="John_Wesley_Powell" title="wikilink">John Wesley Powell</a> in 1869. American explorers collected valuable information that would later be used to investigate the feasibility of developing the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid-to-late 19th century, with <a href="steamboat" title="wikilink">steamboats</a> providing transportation and trade along the Colorado and <a href="Gila_River" title="wikilink">Gila</a> rivers. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was also the setting of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.</p>
<p>Major engineering of the river basin began around the start of the 20th century, with many guidelines for development established in a series of domestic and international treaties known as the &quot;Law of the River&quot;. The U.S. federal government was the main driving force behind the construction of hydraulic engineering projects in the river system, although many state and local water agencies were also involved. Most of the major dams in the river basin were built between 1910 and 1970, with the system keystone, <a href="Hoover_Dam" title="wikilink">Hoover Dam</a>, completed in 1935. Because of these developments, the Colorado River is now considered among the most controlled and litigated in the world, with every drop of its water fully allocated. High rates of water removal for irrigation and industry combined with declines in natural runoff due to climate change could lead to severe shortages by the mid-21st century, endangering power generation and water supply.</p>
<p>The construction of dams and associated <a href="water_export" title="wikilink">water export</a> schemes on the Colorado River system have been a flashpoint for the <a href="environmental_movement" title="wikilink">environmental movement</a> in the American Southwest, due to their impacts on the ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of <a href="Glen_Canyon_Dam" title="wikilink">Glen Canyon Dam</a>, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.</p>

<p><img src="Kawuneeche_Valley.jpg" title="fig:The Kawuneeche Valley, near the headwaters of the Colorado River" alt="The Kawuneeche Valley, near the headwaters of the Colorado River" /> The Colorado begins at <a href="La_Poudre_Pass" title="wikilink">La Poudre Pass</a> in the <a href="Southern_Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Southern Rocky Mountains</a> of Colorado, at more than  above sea level.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After a short run south, the river turns west below <a href="Grand_Lake_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Grand Lake</a>, the largest natural lake in the state. For the first  of its course, the Colorado carves its way through the mountainous <a href="Colorado_Western_Slope" title="wikilink">Western Slope</a>, a sparsely populated region defined by the portion of the state west of the <a href="Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Continental Divide</a>. As it flows southwest, it gains strength from many small tributaries, as well as larger ones including the <a href="Blue_River_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Blue</a>, <a href="Eagle_River_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Eagle</a> and <a href="Roaring_Fork_River" title="wikilink">Roaring Fork</a> rivers. After passing through <a href="De_Beque_Canyon" title="wikilink">De Beque Canyon</a>, the Colorado emerges from the Rockies into the <a href="Grand_Valley_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Grand Valley</a>, a major farming and ranching region where it meets one of its largest tributaries, the <a href="Gunnison_River" title="wikilink">Gunnison River</a>, at <a href="Grand_Junction,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Grand Junction</a>. Most of the upper river is a swift whitewater stream ranging from  wide,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> although there are exceptions, such as the marshy Kawuneeche Valley near the headwaters<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the Grand Valley, where it exhibits <a href="braided_stream" title="wikilink">braided</a> characteristics.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Arcing northwest, the Colorado begins to cut across the eponymous <a href="Colorado_Plateau" title="wikilink">Colorado Plateau</a>, a vast area of high desert centered at the <a href="Four_Corners" title="wikilink">Four Corners</a> of the southwestern United States. Here, the climate becomes significantly drier than that in the Rocky Mountains, and the river becomes entrenched in progressively deeper gorges of bare rock, beginning with <a href="Ruby_Canyon" title="wikilink">Ruby Canyon</a> and then <a href="Westwater_Canyon" title="wikilink">Westwater Canyon</a> as it enters <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a>, now once again heading southwest.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Further downstream it receives the <a href="Dolores_River" title="wikilink">Dolores River</a> and defines the southern border of <a href="Arches_National_Park" title="wikilink">Arches National Park</a>, before passing <a href="Moab,_Utah" title="wikilink">Moab</a> and flowing through &quot;The Portal&quot;, where it exits the Moab Valley between a pair of  sandstone cliffs.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

Here, the <a href="San_Juan_River_(Colorado_River)" title="wikilink">San Juan River</a>, carrying runoff from the southern slope of Colorado's <a href="San_Juan_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Juan Mountains</a>, joins the Colorado from the east. The Colorado then enters northern <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, where since the 1960s <a href="Glen_Canyon_Dam" title="wikilink">Glen Canyon Dam</a> near <a href="Page,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Page</a> has flooded the Glen Canyon reach of the river, forming <a href="Lake_Powell" title="wikilink">Lake Powell</a> for water supply and <a href="hydroelectricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroelectricity</a> generation.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>
<p>As recently as the <a href="Cretaceous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cretaceous</a> period 100 million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>. Tectonic forces from the collision of the <a href="Farallon_Plate" title="wikilink">Farallon Plate</a> with the <a href="North_American_Plate" title="wikilink">North American Plate</a> pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50 million years ago in a mountain-building episode known as the <a href="Laramide_orogeny" title="wikilink">Laramide orogeny</a>. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20 million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the <a href="Mid-Tertiary_ignimbrite_flare-up" title="wikilink">Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up</a>, which created smaller formations such as the <a href="Chiricahua_Mountains" title="wikilink">Chiricahua Mountains</a> in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the <a href="Eocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eocene</a>, between about 55 and 34 million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5 million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The exact nature in which the river's present course and the Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5 million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and <a href="Pacific_Plate" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> plates,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean &lt;U+2013&gt; possibly <a href="Monterey_Bay" title="wikilink">Monterey Bay</a> on the Central California coast, forming the <a href="Monterey_Canyon" title="wikilink">Monterey submarine canyon</a>. The uplift of the <a href="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">Sierra Nevada</a> mountains began about 4.5 million years ago, diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5 million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an <a href="antecedent_stream" title="wikilink">antecedent stream</a>) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of <a href="Paradox_Valley" title="wikilink">Paradox Valley</a> in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="VulcanUinkart.jpg" title="fig:Remnants of basalt flows from the Uinkaret volcanic field are seen here descending into the Grand Canyon, where they dammed the Colorado over 10 times in the past 2 million years." alt="Remnants of basalt flows from the Uinkaret volcanic field are seen here descending into the Grand Canyon, where they dammed the Colorado over 10 times in the past 2 million years." width="300" /> Sediments carried from the plateau by the Colorado River created a vast delta made of more than  of material that walled off the northernmost part of the gulf in approximately 1 million years. Cut off from the ocean, the portion of the gulf north of the delta eventually evaporated and formed the <a href="Salton_Sink" title="wikilink">Salton Sink</a>, which reached about  below sea level.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Since then the river has changed course into the Salton Sink at least three times, transforming it into <a href="Lake_Cahuilla" title="wikilink">Lake Cahuilla</a>, which at maximum size flooded up the valley to present-day <a href="Indio,_California" title="wikilink">Indio, California</a>. The lake took about 50 years to evaporate after the Colorado resumed flowing to the Gulf. The present-day Salton Sea can be considered the most recent incarnation of Lake Cahuilla, though on a much smaller scale.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago, massive flows of <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a> from the <a href="Uinkaret_volcanic_field" title="wikilink">Uinkaret volcanic field</a> in northern Arizona dammed the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. At least 13 <a href="lava_dam" title="wikilink">lava dams</a> were formed, the largest of which was more than  high, backing the river up for nearly  to present-day Moab, Utah.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The lack of associated sediment deposits along this stretch of the Colorado River, which would have accumulated in the impounded lakes over time, suggests that most of these dams did not survive for more than a few decades before collapsing or being washed away.

Very little human activity occurred in the watershed until the rise of the <a href="Desert_Archaic_Culture" title="wikilink">Desert Archaic Culture</a>, which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (though some of the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America after the end of the Pleistocene epoch).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Another notable early group was the <a href="Fremont_culture" title="wikilink">Fremont culture</a>, whose peoples inhabited the Colorado Plateau from 2,000 to 700 years ago.

<p>Beginning in the early centuries A.D., Colorado River basin peoples began to form large agriculture-based societies, some of which lasted hundreds of years and grew into well-organized civilizations encompassing tens of thousands of inhabitants. The <a href="Ancient_Puebloan" title="wikilink">Ancient Puebloan</a> (also known as <a href="Anasazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anasazi</a> or Hisatsinom) people of the <a href="Four_Corners" title="wikilink">Four Corners</a> region were descended from the Desert Archaic culture.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The Puebloans dominated the basin of the San Juan River, with the center of their civilization in northern New Mexico's <a href="Chaco_Canyon" title="wikilink">Chaco Canyon</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In Chaco Canyon and the surrounding lands, they built more than 150 multi-story pueblos or &quot;great houses&quot;, the largest of which, <a href="Pueblo_Bonito" title="wikilink">Pueblo Bonito</a>, is composed of more than 600 rooms.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The <a href="Hohokam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hohokam</a> culture was present along the middle Gila River beginning around 1 A.D. Between 600 and 700 A.D. they began to employ irrigation on a large scale, and did so more prolifically than any other native group in the Colorado River basin.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> An extensive system of irrigation canals was constructed on the Gila and <a href="Salt_River_(Arizona)" title="wikilink">Salt</a> rivers, with various estimates of a total length ranging from  and capable of irrigating .

<p>These sedentary peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing logging and harvesting of other resources on a large scale. The construction of irrigation canals may have led to a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and <a href="Chaco_Wash" title="wikilink">Chaco</a> were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large <a href="floodplain" title="wikilink">floodplains</a>.

<p>Beginning in the 17th century, contact with Europeans brought significant changes to the lifestyles of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin. Missionaries sought to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity, some of which met with success such as <a href="Eusebio_Kino" title="wikilink">Father Eusebio Francisco Kino</a>'s 1694 encounter with the &quot;docile Pimas of the Gila Valley [who] readily accepted Father Kino and his Christian teachings&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The Spanish introduced sheep and goats to the Navajo, who came to rely heavily on them for meat, milk and wool.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> By the mid-16th century, the Utes, having acquired horses from the Spanish, introduced them to the Colorado River basin.

More warlike groups such as the Utes and Navajos often used the horse to their advantage in raids against tribes that were slower to adopt horses, such as the <a href="Goshute" title="wikilink">Goshutes</a> and <a href="Southern_Paiute" title="wikilink">Southern Paiutes</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Mohave_Indians.jpg" title="fig:A pair of Mohave warriors beside the Colorado River in 1871" alt="A pair of Mohave warriors beside the Colorado River in 1871" /> The gradual influx of European and American explorers, fortune seekers and settlers into the region eventually led to conflicts that forced many Native Americans off their traditional lands.

In what is now known as the Long Walk of the Navajo, the captives &lt;U+2013&gt; many of whom died along the harsh route &lt;U+2013&gt; were marched from Arizona to <a href="Fort_Sumner" title="wikilink">Fort Sumner</a> in New Mexico. Four years later, the Navajo signed a treaty that moved them onto a reservation in the Four Corners region that is today known as the <a href="Navajo_Nation" title="wikilink">Navajo Nation</a>, the largest Native American reservation in the United States, encompassing  with a population of over 180,000 as of 2000.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

Ten Native American tribes in the basin now hold, or continue to claim, water rights to the Colorado River.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The U.S. government has taken some action to help quantify and develop the water resources of Native American reservations.

<h3 id="early-explorers">Early explorers</h3>
<p>During the 16th century, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. An early motive was the search for the <a href="Seven_Cities_of_Gold_(myth)" title="wikilink">Seven Cities of Gold</a>, or &quot;Cibola&quot;, rumored to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest. In 1536 <a href="Francisco_de_Ulloa" title="wikilink">Francisco de Ulloa</a>, the first documented European to reach the Colorado River, sailed up the Gulf of California and a short distance into the river's delta.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> <a href="Francisco_V&lt;U+00E1&gt;squez_de_Coronado" title="wikilink">Francisco V&lt;U+00E1&gt;squez de Coronado</a>'s 1540&lt;U+2013&gt;1542 expedition began as a search for the fabled Cities of Gold, but after learning from natives in New Mexico of a large river to the west, he sent <a href="Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez_de_C&lt;U+00E1&gt;rdenas" title="wikilink">Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez de C&lt;U+00E1&gt;rdenas</a> to lead a small contingent to find it. With the guidance of Hopi Indians, C&lt;U+00E1&gt;rdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon. C&lt;U+00E1&gt;rdenas was reportedly unimpressed with the canyon, assuming the width of the Colorado River at  and estimating -tall rock formations to be the size of a man.

Alarc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California&lt;U+2013&gt;Arizona border. Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n eventually gave up and left. <a href="Melchior_D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az" title="wikilink">Melchior D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az</a> reached the delta in the same year, intending to establish contact with Alarc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, but the latter was already gone by the time of D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az's arrival. D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az named the Colorado River <em>Rio del Tizon</em> (&quot;Firebrand River&quot;) after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The name <em>Tizon</em> lasted for the next 200 years, while the name <em>Rio Colorado</em> (&quot;Red River&quot;) was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River, possibly the <a href="Verde_River" title="wikilink">Verde River</a>, circa 1720.

<p>During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans and Spanish believed in the existence of the <a href="Buenaventura_River_(legend)" title="wikilink">Buenaventura River</a>, purported to run from the Rocky Mountains in Utah or Colorado to the Pacific Ocean. The name <em>Buenaventura</em> was given to the Green River by <a href="Silvestre_V&lt;U+00E9&gt;lez_de_Escalante" title="wikilink">Silvestre V&lt;U+00E9&gt;lez de Escalante</a> as early as 1776, but Escalante did not know that the Green drained to the Colorado. Many later maps showed the headwaters of the Green and Colorado rivers connecting with the Sevier River (Rio San Ysabel) and <a href="Utah_Lake" title="wikilink">Utah Lake</a> (Lake Timpanogos) before flowing west through the Sierra Nevada into California. Mountain man <a href="Jedediah_Smith" title="wikilink">Jedediah Smith</a> reached the lower Colorado by way of the Virgin River canyon in 1826. Smith called the Colorado the &quot;Seedskeedee&quot;, as the Green River in Wyoming was known to fur trappers, correctly believing it to be a continuation of the Green and not a separate river as others believed under the Buenaventura myth. <a href="John_C._Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;mont" title="wikilink">John C. Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;mont</a>'s 1843 Great Basin expedition proved that no river traversed the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada, officially debunking the Buenaventura myth.</p>
<p><img src="Canyon_midday.jpg" title="fig:Marble Canyon, one of the many gorges that Powell&#39;s expedition traversed" alt="Marble Canyon, one of the many gorges that Powell&#39;s expedition traversed" /> In 1857, Lieutenant <a href="Joseph_Christmas_Ives" title="wikilink">Joseph C. Ives</a> led an expedition to explore the feasibility of using the Colorado River as a navigation route in the Southwest. Ives and his men used a specially built steamboat, the shallow-draft U.S.S. <em>Explorer</em>, and traveled up the river as far as <a href="Black_Canyon_of_the_Colorado" title="wikilink">Black Canyon</a> on the present Arizona&lt;U+2013&gt;Nevada border. After experiencing numerous groundings and accidents and inhibited by low water in the river, Ives declared: &quot;Ours has been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality. It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River, along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way, shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed.&quot;</p>
<p>Up until the mid-19th century, long stretches of the Colorado and Green rivers between Wyoming and Nevada remained largely unexplored due to the remote location and dangers of navigating the river. Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran <a href="John_Wesley_Powell" title="wikilink">John Wesley Powell</a> led <a href="Powell_Geographic_Expedition_of_1869" title="wikilink">an expedition</a> from <a href="Green_River,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Green River Station</a> in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to <a href="St._Thomas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">St. Thomas, Nevada</a>, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men &lt;U+2013&gt; none of whom had prior whitewater experience &lt;U+2013&gt; set out in May. After braving the rapids of the <a href="Gates_of_Lodore" title="wikilink">Gates of Lodore</a>, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:</p>

<p>On August 28, 1869, three men deserted the expedition, convinced that they could not possibly survive the trip through the canyon. They were killed by either Native Americans or Mormon settlers after making it to the rim of the Grand Canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green Rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore.

<h3 id="american-settlement">American settlement</h3>
<p>During the <a href="Manifest_Destiny" title="wikilink">Manifest Destiny</a> era of the mid-19th century, American pioneers settled many western states but generally avoided the Colorado River basin until the 1850s. Under <a href="Brigham_Young" title="wikilink">Brigham Young</a>'s grand vision for a &quot;vast empire in the desert&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> (the <a href="State_of_Deseret" title="wikilink">State of Deseret</a>) <a href="Mormon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mormon</a> settlers were among the first whites to establish a permanent presence in the watershed. In 1865, Mormon colonists founded St. Thomas at the confluence of the Colorado and Virgin rivers in Nevada. The settlement reached a peak population of about 600 before being abandoned in 1871, and thereafter the surrounding valley became a haven for outlaws and cattle rustlers.</p>
<p><img src="John_D._Lee.jpg" title="fig:John D. Lee, date and photographer unknown. He established a permanent ferry across the Colorado." alt="John D. Lee, date and photographer unknown. He established a permanent ferry across the Colorado." /> Mormons founded the settlement of <a href="Vernal,_Utah" title="wikilink">Vernal</a> along the Green River in Utah in 1878, and populated the Little Colorado River valley later in the century, creating towns such as <a href="St._Johns,_Arizona" title="wikilink">St. Johns, Arizona</a>. They also established settlements along the <a href="Gila_River" title="wikilink">Gila River</a> in central Arizona beginning in 1871. These early settlers were impressed by the extensive ruins of the Hohokam civilization that previously occupied the Gila River valley, and are said to have &quot;envisioned their new agricultural civilization rising as the mythical <em>phoenix</em> bird from the ashes of Hohokam society&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The Mormons were the first whites to develop the water resources of the basin on a large scale, and built complex networks of dams and canals to irrigate wheat, oats and barley in addition to establishing extensive sheep and cattle ranches.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the main reasons the Mormons were able to colonize Arizona was the existence of <a href="Jacob_Hamblin" title="wikilink">Jacob Hamblin</a>'s ferry across the Colorado at Lee's Ferry (then known as Pahreah Crossing), which began running in March 1864.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> This location was the only section of river for hundreds of miles in both directions where the canyon walls dropped away, allowing for the development of a transport route. <a href="John_Doyle_Lee" title="wikilink">John Doyle Lee</a> established a more permanent ferry system at the site in 1870. One reason Lee chose to run the ferry was to flee from Mormon leaders who held him responsible for the <a href="Mountain_Meadows_Massacre" title="wikilink">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a>, in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by <a href="Nauvoo_Legion" title="wikilink">a local militia</a> disguised as Native Americans. Even though it was located along a major travel route, Lee's Ferry was very isolated, and there Lee and his family established the aptly named <a href="Lonely_Dell_Ranch_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Lonely Dell Ranch</a>.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> In 1928, the ferry sank resulting in the deaths of three men.

<p>Gold strikes from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries played a major role in attracting settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the <a href="Blue_River_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Blue River</a> in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of <a href="Breckenridge,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Breckenridge</a>. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the <a href="Uncompahgre_River" title="wikilink">Uncompahgre</a> and <a href="San_Miguel_River_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">San Miguel</a> rivers, also in Colorado, and these led to the creation of <a href="Ouray,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Ouray</a> and <a href="Telluride,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Telluride</a>, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in <a href="lode" class="uri" title="wikilink">lode</a> deposits, extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to <a href="acid_mine_drainage" title="wikilink">acid mine drainage</a> problems in some regional streams and rivers.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to 1921, the upper Colorado above the confluence with the Green River in Utah was not considered part of the main stem. This section of the Colorado had been known as the <em>Grand River</em> since 1836. In 1921, U.S. Representative <a href="Edward_T._Taylor" title="wikilink">Edward T.

<p>Meanwhile, large-scale development was also beginning on the opposite end of the Colorado River. In 1900, entrepreneurs of the <a href="California_Development_Company" title="wikilink">California Development Company</a> (CDC) looked to the Imperial Valley of southern California as an excellent location to develop agriculture irrigated by the waters of the river. Engineer <a href="George_Chaffey" title="wikilink">George Chaffey</a> was hired to design the <a href="Alamo_Canal" title="wikilink">Alamo Canal</a>, which split off from the Colorado River near <a href="Pilot_Knob_(Imperial_County,_California)" title="wikilink">Pilot Knob</a>, curved south into Mexico, and dumped into the <a href="Alamo_River" title="wikilink">Alamo River</a>, a dry arroyo which had historically been observed to carry flood flows of the Colorado into the Salton Sink. With a stable year-round flow in the Alamo River, irrigators in the Imperial Valley were able to begin large-scale farming, and small towns in the region started to expand with the influx of job-seeking migrants.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> By 1903, more than  in the valley were under cultivation, supporting a growing population of 4,000.</p>
<p>It was not long before the Colorado River began to wreak havoc with its erratic flows. In autumn, the river would drop below the level of the canal inlet, and temporary brush diversion dams had to be constructed. In early 1905, heavy floods destroyed the headworks of the canal, and water began to flow uncontrolled down the canal towards the Salton Sink. On August 9, the entire flow of the Colorado swerved into the canal and began to flood the bottom of the Imperial Valley. In a desperate gamble to close the breach, crews of the <a href="Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Southern Pacific Railroad</a>, whose tracks ran through the valley, attempted to dam the Colorado above the canal, only to see their work demolished by a flash flood.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> It took seven attempts, more than $3 million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the federal government to permanently block the breach and send the Colorado on its natural course to the gulf &lt;U+2013&gt; but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a  lake, today's Salton Sea.

<p>Central Arizona initially relied on the Gila River and its tributaries through projects such as the <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt_Dam" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="Coolidge_Dam" title="wikilink">Coolidge</a> Dams &lt;U+2013&gt; completed in 1924 and 1928, respectively.

This resulted in the inception of the <a href="Central_Arizona_Project" title="wikilink">Central Arizona Project</a> (CAP) in 1968, which now irrigates more than  and provides municipal supplies to over 5 million people from Phoenix to Tucson using water from the Colorado River.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Because of the large amount of power that would be required to pump Colorado River water to Arizona, the CAP originally included provisions for hydroelectric dams at <a href="Bridge_Canyon_Dam" title="wikilink">Bridge Canyon</a> and Marble Canyon, which would have flooded large portions of the Colorado within the Grand Canyon and dewatered much of the remainder.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> When these plans were publicized, the environmental movement successfully lobbied against the project.

<p>Through the early decades of the 20th century, the Upper Basin states with the exception of Colorado remained relatively undeveloped and used little of the water allowed to them under the Colorado River Compact. Water use had increased significantly by the 1950s, and more water was being diverted out of the Colorado River basin to the Front Range corridor, the <a href="Salt_Lake_City" title="wikilink">Salt Lake City</a> area in Utah, and the Rio Grande basin in New Mexico. Such projects included the Roberts Tunnel, completed in 1956, which diverts  per year from the Blue River to the city of Denver,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> and the <a href="Fryingpan-Arkansas_Project" title="wikilink">Fryingpan-Arkansas Project</a>, which delivers  from the <a href="Fryingpan_River" title="wikilink">Fryingpan River</a> to the <a href="Arkansas_River" title="wikilink">Arkansas River</a> basin each year.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Without the addition of surface water storage in the upper basin, there was no guarantee that the upper basin states would be able to use the full amount of water given to them by the compact. There was also the concern that drought could impair the upper basin's ability to deliver the required  past Lee's Ferry per year as stipulated by the compact. A 1956 act of Congress cleared the way for the USBR's <a href="Colorado_River_Storage_Project" title="wikilink">Colorado River Storage Project</a> (CRSP), which entailed the construction of large dams on the Colorado, Green, Gunnison and San Juan Rivers.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>The initial blueprints for the CRSP included two dams on the Green River within <a href="Dinosaur_National_Monument" title="wikilink">Dinosaur National Monument</a>'s <a href="Echo_Park_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Echo Park Canyon</a>, a move criticized by both the <a href="U.S._National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. National Park Service</a> and environmentalist groups such as the <a href="Sierra_Club" title="wikilink">Sierra Club</a>.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Controversy reached a nationwide scale, and the USBR dropped its plans for the Dinosaur dams in exchange for a dam at <a href="Flaming_Gorge_Dam" title="wikilink">Flaming Gorge</a> and a raise to an already-proposed dam at <a href="Glen_Canyon" title="wikilink">Glen Canyon</a>. The famed opposition to Glen Canyon Dam, the primary feature of the CRSP, did not build momentum until construction was well underway. This was primarily because of Glen Canyon's remote location and the result that most of the American public did not even know of the existence of the impressive gorge; the few who had, contended that it had much greater scenic value than Echo Park. Sierra Club leader <a href="David_Brower" title="wikilink">David Brower</a> fought the dam both during the construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000. Brower strongly believed that he was personally responsible for the failure to prevent Glen Canyon's flooding, calling it his &quot;greatest mistake, greatest sin&quot;.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

This sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along the river's lower course, particularly in its  delta, once the largest desert estuary on the continent.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Currently, the majority of sediments carried by the Colorado River are deposited at the upper end of Lake Powell, and most of the remainder ends up in Lake Mead. Various estimates place the time it would take for Powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years.

Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> In the 21st century, there has been renewed interest in restoring a limited water flow to the delta. In November 2012, the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement &lt;U+2013&gt; known as Minute 319 &lt;U+2013&gt; permitting Mexico storage of its water allotment in U.S. reservoirs during wet years, thus increasing the efficiency with which the water can be used. In addition to renovating irrigation canals in the <a href="Mexicali_Valley" title="wikilink">Mexicali Valley</a> to reduce leakage, this will make about  per year available for release to the delta. The water will be used to provide both an annual base flow and a spring &quot;pulse flow&quot; to mimic the river's original snowmelt-driven regime.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a><a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>Reduced flows have led to increases in the concentration of certain substances in the lower river that have impacted water quality. Salinity is one of the major issues. The lower Colorado's salt content was about 50 parts per million (ppm) in its natural state,<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> but by the 1960s, it had increased to well over 2000 ppm.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> By the early 1970s, there was also serious concern about salinity caused by salts leached from local soils by irrigation drainage water, which were estimated to add  of excess salt to the river per year. The <a href="Colorado_River_Basin_Salinity_Control_Program" title="wikilink">Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act</a> was passed in 1974, mandating conservation practices including the reduction of saline drainage. The program reduced the annual load by about , but salinity remains an ongoing issue.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> In 1997, the USBR estimated that saline irrigation water caused crop damages exceeding $500 million in the U.S. and $100 million in Mexico. Further efforts have been made to combat the salt issue in the lower Colorado, including the construction of a <a href="desalination_plant" title="wikilink">desalination plant</a> at Yuma.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> In 2011, the seven U.S. states agreed upon a &quot;Plan of Implementation&quot;, which aims to reduce salinity by  per year by 2030.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>Agricultural runoff containing pesticide residues has also been concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the <a href="New_River_(Mexico-United_States)" title="wikilink">New</a> and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea are among the most polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Pollution from agricultural runoff is not limited to the lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>Large dams such as Hoover and Glen Canyon typically release water from lower levels of their reservoirs, resulting in stable and relatively cold year-round temperatures in long reaches of the river. The Colorado's average temperature once ranged from  at the height of summer to near freezing, , in winter &lt;U+2013&gt; but modern flows through the Grand Canyon, for example, rarely deviate significantly from .<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Changes in temperature regime have caused declines of native fish populations, and stable flows enable increased vegetation growth, obstructing riverside habitat.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> These flow patterns have also made the Colorado more dangerous to recreational boaters: people are more likely to die of hypothermia in the colder water, and the general lack of flooding allows rockslides to build up, making the river more difficult to navigate.</p>
