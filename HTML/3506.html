<p>The <a href="Order_(organization)" title="wikilink">Order</a> of the <strong>Knights of Columbus</strong> is the world's largest <a href="Catholic_Church_(disambiguation)#Catholic_churches_recognising_the_primacy_of_the_bishop_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> <a href="Fraternal_and_service_organizations" title="wikilink">fraternal</a> <a href="Volunteer" title="wikilink">service</a> organization. Founded in 1882, it is named in honor of <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a> and dedicated to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. There are more than 1.7 million members in 14,000 councils, including nearly 200 on college campuses. Membership is limited to &quot;practical Catholic&quot; <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> men who are at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>Councils have been chartered in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a>, <a href="Central_America" title="wikilink">Central America</a>, the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>, <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>, <a href="Saipan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saipan</a> and most recently in <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>. The Knights' official junior order, the <a href="Columbian_Squires" title="wikilink">Columbian Squires</a>, has over 5,000 Circles. All the Order's <a href="ceremonial" title="wikilink">ceremonials</a> and business meetings are restricted to members though all other events are open to the public. An oath not to reveal any details of the ceremonials except to an equally qualified Knight is required to ensure their impact and meaning for new members; an additional clause in the oath subordinates the vow to the swearer's legal and religious duties.</p>
<p>Knights are known for their strong Catholicity and have been called the &quot;strong right arm of the Church.&quot; In the 2005 fraternal year the Order gave $136 million directly to charity and performed over 63.2 million man hours of voluntary service. The Order's insurance program has more than $55 billion of life insurance policies in force and holds the highest insurance ratings given by <a href="A.M._Best" title="wikilink">A.M. Best</a>, <a href="Standard_&amp;_Poor" title="wikilink">Standard &amp; Poor</a> and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Father_McGivney_300.jpg" title="fig:Fr. Michael J. McGivney, founder of the Knights of Columbus" alt="Fr. Michael J. McGivney, founder of the Knights of Columbus" /> The Knights of Columbus was founded by a <a href="Catholic_priest" title="wikilink">Catholic priest</a>, Father <a href="Michael_J._McGivney" title="wikilink">Michael J. McGivney</a> in <a href="New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">New Haven, Connecticut</a> on <a href="February_2" title="wikilink">February 2</a>, <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a>, and incorporated under the laws of <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a> on <a href="March_29" title="wikilink">March 29</a>, <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Though the first councils were all in that state, the Order spread throughout <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the following years.</p>
<p>The primary motivation for the Order was to be a <a href="Mutual_organization" title="wikilink">mutual benefit society</a>. As a parish priest in an immigrant community, McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the breadwinner died and wanted to provide <a href="Knights_of_Columbus#Insurance_program" title="wikilink">insurance</a> to care for the <a href="widow" title="wikilink">widows</a> and <a href="orphan" title="wikilink">orphans</a> left behind. He himself had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the late 19th century, Catholics were regularly excluded from <a href="labor_union" title="wikilink">labor unions</a> and other organizations that provided social services. In addition, Catholics were either banned by many of the popular fraternal organizations, or, as in the case of <a href="Freemasonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freemasonry</a>, <a href="Catholicism_and_Freemasonry" title="wikilink">forbidden</a> by the Catholic Church itself. McGivney wished to provide them an alternative. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wished to found a society that would encourage men to be proud of their American-Catholic heritage.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>McGivney traveled to <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> to examine the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a> to learn about the recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He expressed an interest in establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the charter of Massachusetts Foresters prevented them from operating outside their Commonwealth. The committee of St. Mary's parishioners McGivney had assembled then decided to form a club that was entirely original.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>McGivney had originally conceived of the name &quot;Sons of Columbus&quot; but <a href="James_T._Mullen" title="wikilink">James T. Mullen</a>, who would become the first Supreme Knight, successfully suggested that &quot;Knights of Columbus&quot; would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Order was founded 10 years before the 400th anniversary of Columbus' first visit to the New World and in a time of renewed interest in him. Columbus was a hero to many American Catholics and the naming him as <a href="patron" class="uri" title="wikilink">patron</a> was partly an attempt to build a bridge between the Irish-Catholic founders of the Order and the Catholic immigrants of other nationalities living in Connecticut.</p>

<img src="CristobalColon.jpg" title="The Knights of Columbus was founded in a time of increased interest in Christopher Columbus." alt="The Knights of Columbus was founded in a time of increased interest in Christopher Columbus." /><figcaption>The Knights of Columbus was founded in a time of increased interest in <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <em><a href="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Hartford" title="wikilink">Connecticut Catholic</a></em> ran an editorial in 1878 that illustrated how American Catholics esteemed Columbus. &quot;As American Catholics we do not know of anyone who more deserves our grateful remembrance than the great and noble man - the pious, zealous, faithful Catholic, the enterprising navigator, and the large-hearted and generous sailor: Christopher Columbus.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The name of Columbus was also partially intended as a mild ridicule of <a href="WASP" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon Protestant</a> leaders, who upheld the explorer (a Catholic <a href="Genoa" title="wikilink">Genovese</a> <a href="Italians" title="wikilink">Italian</a> working for Catholic <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>) as an American hero, yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent Catholic immigrants. In taking Columbus as their patron they were sending the message that not only could Catholics be full members of American society but indeed they were instrumental in its foundation.</p>
<p>By the time of the first annual convention in 1884 the Order was prospering. In the five councils throughout Connecticut were 459 members and groups from other states were requesting information.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Charter of 1899 included four statements of purpose, including &quot;to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper, and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The new charter showed members' desire to grow the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society.</p>
<p>The original insurance system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death and when the number of Knights grew beyond 1,000 the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks. If he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him. At the time, $5 was nearly 2/3 of the pay a man in his 30s or 40s could expect to bring home each week.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Today there are more than 14,000 councils around the world and the Knights of Columbus is a multi-billion dollar non-profit charitable organization. Knights may be seen distributing <a href="Tootsie_Rolls" title="wikilink">Tootsie Rolls</a> to raise funds to fight mental illness, volunteering for the <a href="Special_Olympics" title="wikilink">Special Olympics</a> and other charitable organizations, erecting <a href="pro-life" class="uri" title="wikilink">pro-life</a> billboards and &quot;Keep Christ in Christmas&quot; signs, conducting blood drives and raising funds for disaster victims, or parading at patriotic events with their bright capes, feathered chapeaux, and ceremonial swords. The cause for McGivney's <a href="canonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">canonization</a> is currently before the <a href="Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints" title="wikilink">Congregation for the Causes of Saints</a> and a <a href="http://www.fathermcgivney.org">guild</a> has been formed to promote his cause. If his cause is successful he will be the first American born priest to be declared to be a saint.</p>

<p>The Supreme Council is the governing body of the Order and is composed of elected representatives from each jurisdiction. The Supreme Council acts in similar manner to <a href="shareholder" title="wikilink">shareholders</a> at an annual meeting and each year elects seven members to the Supreme <a href="Board_of_Directors" title="wikilink">Board of Directors</a> for three year terms. The twenty-one member board then chooses from its own membership the senior operating officials of the Order, including the <a href="Supreme_Knight_of_the_Knights_of_Columbus" title="wikilink">Supreme Knight</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>State Councils in each of the 50 United States, each province in Canada, and other jurisdictions carved out of member countries are led by State Deputies and other officers elected at state conventions. Territorial Deputies are appointed by the Supreme Knight and lead areas not yet incorporated into State Councils.</p>
<p>District Deputies are appointed by the State Deputy and oversee several local councils, each of which is led by a Grand Knight. Other elected council officers include the Deputy Grand Knight, Chancellor, Warden, Recorder, Treasurer, Advocate, Faithful Navigator, Guards and Trustees. A Chaplain is appointed by the Grand Knight and a Financial Secretary by the Supreme Knight. Councils are numbered in the order in which they chartered into the Order and are named by the local membership. San Salvador Council #1 was named for the <a href="Guanahani" title="wikilink">first island</a> Columbus landed on in the <a href="New_World" title="wikilink">New World</a>.</p>
<p>The title &quot;Knight&quot; is purely fraternal and is not the equivalent to a <a href="Accolade_(knighthood)" title="wikilink">sovereign accolade</a>. Therefore <em>Knights</em> of Columbus do not rank with Chevaliers and Commanders of the <a href="Order_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre" title="wikilink">Order of the Holy Sepulchre</a>, the <a href="Order_of_Malta" title="wikilink">Order of Malta</a>, the <a href="Order_of_St._Gregory_the_Great" title="wikilink">Order of St. Gregory the Great</a>, and other historic <a href="Military_order" title="wikilink">military</a> or <a href="chivalric_order" title="wikilink">chivalric orders</a>.</p>
<h2 id="degrees-and-principles">Degrees and Principles</h2>
<p>The Order is dedicated to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He is then said to be a First Degree Knight of Columbus and after participating the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, rises to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree a gentleman is considered a full member. <a href="Catholic_priest" title="wikilink">Priests</a> do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as <a href="Laity" title="wikilink">lay men</a> do, but rather take the degree by observation.</p>
<p>The first ritual handbook was printed in 1885 but contained only sections teaching Unity and Charity. Supreme Knight Mullen, along with primary ritual author Daniel Colwell, believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections &quot;in accord with the 'Trinity of Virtues, Charity, Unity, and Brotherly love.'&quot; The third section, expounding Fraternity, was officially adopted in 1891.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The primary purpose of the Fourth Degree is to foster the spirit of <a href="patriotism" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriotism</a> and to encourage active Catholic <a href="citizenship" class="uri" title="wikilink">citizenship</a>. Fewer than 20% of Knights join the Fourth Degree, which is optional and of higher rank.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A Knight must be active in his council for one year before he can join a Fourth Degree Assembly.</p>
<p>Assemblies are distinct from councils and are led by a separate set of elected officers. The Supreme Board of Directors appoints a Supreme Master and twenty Vice Supreme Masters to govern the Fourth Degree. Each Vice Supreme Master oversees a Province which is then broken up into Districts. The Supreme Master appoints District Masters to supervise several assemblies.</p>
<p>Fourth Degree Knights may purchase the full regalia and join the Assembly&lt;U+2019&gt;s Color Corps. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black <a href="tuxedo" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuxedo</a>, <a href="baldric" class="uri" title="wikilink">baldric</a>, white gloves, <a href="cape" class="uri" title="wikilink">cape</a> and naval <a href="chapeau" class="uri" title="wikilink">chapeau</a>. Baldrics are worn from the right shoulder to left hip and are color specific by nation. In the United States, baldrics are red, white and blue. Service baldrics include a holster for a <a href="sword" class="uri" title="wikilink">sword</a> and are worn over the coat while social baldrics are worn under the coat. The colors on a Fourth Degree Knight's cape and chapeau denote the office he holds within the Degree. Masters and Vice Supreme Masters are also denoted by their gold swords.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The need for a patriotic degree was first considered in 1886 and a special plea was made at the National Meeting of 1899. The first Fourth Degree exemplification followed in 1900 with 1,100 Knights participating at the Lenox Lyceum in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Today there are more than 2,500 Assemblies.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="insurance-program">Insurance program</h2>
<p>Many early members were recent immigrants who often lived in unsanitary conditions and performed hazardous jobs for poor pay. Since its founding, a primary mission of the Knights of Columbus has been to protect families against the financial ruin caused by the death of the breadwinner. While this method originally was intended to provide a core group of people who would support a widow and her children after the death of their husband and father, it has flourished and matured into much more.</p>
<p>Today the Order offers a modern, professional insurance operation with more than $55 billion of life insurance policies in force. Products include <a href="permanent_life_insurance" title="wikilink">permanent</a> and <a href="term_life_insurance" title="wikilink">term life insurance</a> as well as <a href="Annuity_(US_financial_products)" title="wikilink">annuities</a> and <a href="long_term_care_insurance" title="wikilink">long term care insurance</a>. Insurance sales grew 19% in 2004, more than three times the rate of industry at large. The Order holds $12 billion in assets and had $1.5 billion in revenue and $71 million in profits in 2005. This is large enough to rank 72nd on the A.M. Best list of all life insurance companies in North America and places it on the <a href="Fortune_1000" title="wikilink">Fortune 1000</a> list of top companies. Only four other insurers in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> have received the highest ratings from both <a href="A.M._Best" title="wikilink">A.M. Best</a> and <a href="Standard_&amp;_Poor" title="wikilink">Standard &amp; Poor</a>. The Order is certified by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association for ethical sales practices.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="charitable-giving">Charitable giving</h2>
<p>Charity is the first and foremost principle of the Knights of Columbus. Knights have no higher duty than to assist the widow or orphan of a fallen brother Knight, but they give their time, talent and treasure far beyond the families of deceased Knights. In the 2005 fraternal year the Order gave $136 million directly to charity and performed over 63.2 million man hours in voluntary service. Endowed funds of over $54 million support a number of Church related causes.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The Knights are known worldwide for their support for those with physical and <a href="developmental_disabilities" title="wikilink">developmental disabilities</a>. More than $382 million has been given over the past three decades to groups and programs that support the intellectually and physically disabled. One of the largest recipients of funds in this area is the <a href="Special_Olympics" title="wikilink">Special Olympics</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In addition, the Order's highest honor, the <a href="Gaudium_et_Spes" title="wikilink">Gaudium et Spes</a> Award, was given with its $100,000 honorarium to <a href="Jean_Vanier" title="wikilink">Jean Vanier</a>, the founder of <a href="l&#39;Arche" class="uri" title="wikilink">l'Arche</a>, in 2005. L'Arche is a faith-based network that provides care, in a community setting, for people with severe developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The <em>Vicarius Christi</em> Fund has a <a href="corpus" class="uri" title="wikilink">corpus</a> of $20 million and has earned more than $35 million, since its establishment in 1981, for the <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a>'s personal charities. The multimillion dollar <em>Pacem in Terris</em> Fund aids the Catholic Church's efforts for peace in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>. The Order also has eleven separate funds totaling $18 million to assist men and women who are discerning religious vocations pay tuition and other expenses.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Days after the terrorist attacks of <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001</a> the Order established the $1 million Heroes Fund.

The fund is wholly managed, maintained and operated by Knights of Columbus Charities, Inc., a <a href="501(c)(3)" class="uri" title="wikilink">501(c)(3)</a> charitable organization. Before United in Charity was formed all requests for funds were met with the general funds of the Order or in combination with specific appeals. Requests from the Church and organizations closely aligned with the mission of the Order often far exceeded the amount available and it is hoped that eventually United in Charity's earnings will be sufficient to completely fund the Order's charitable priorities.</p>

<p>The <a href="Columbian_Squires" title="wikilink">Columbian Squires</a> is a youth fraternity created by the Knights of Columbus for Catholic boys between the ages of 10 and 18. The Squires were established under the direction of Brother Barnabas McDonald, <a href="Institute_of_the_Brothers_of_the_Christian_Schools" title="wikilink">F.S.C.</a>, on <a href="August_4" title="wikilink">August 4</a>, <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>. It was believed that if &quot;the Knights of Columbus take care of the growing boy... then the boy grown into manhood will take care not only of the Knights of Columbus, but of the Church and the nation as well.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The Squires are broken up into Circles, much like the Knights' Councils. The Squires' motto is &quot;<em>Esto Dignus</em>,&quot; or, translated into English, &quot;<em>Be Worthy!</em>&quot; Some local councils also have youth programs for girls in the same age range known as the Columbian Squirettes, the Squire Roses or another name. The 5000th Squires Circle was instituted at St. Mary's Catholic High School in <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. Squire Circles have been instituted throughout the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>, <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, <a href="Panama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panama</a>, <a href="Guatemala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>, the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, the <a href="Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Virgin Islands</a> and <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="college-councils">College Councils</h2>
<p>While most Knights of Columbus Councils are located at parishes or near multiple parish communities, many men first join the Knights while in college. Over 14,000 Knights are members of 199 College Councils worldwide.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> College Knights are full members of the Order, with the only difference being that the council is located on or near a university campus.</p>

<p>The first College Council was at <a href="The_Catholic_University_of_America" title="wikilink">The Catholic University of America</a>, Keane Council 353, but it has since moved off campus. The Catholic University of America now has a new council, <a href="http://www.cuaknights.com/">number 9542</a>. Today, the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a> <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~knights/">Council 1477</a> has the longest continually running College Council in the country. In 1937, the University of Illinois became the first public university with a Knights of Columbus Council, The Illini Council Number 2782. The <a href="http://www.holycross.edu/departments/history/vlapomar/koc/knight~2.htm">Crusader Council No. 2706</a> at the <a href="College_of_the_Holy_Cross" title="wikilink">College of the Holy Cross</a> in <a href="Worcester,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>, chartered in 1929, is the oldest College Council in New England and the oldest council established on a <a href="Jesuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a> college or university campus.</p>
<p>Some College Councils hold a unique form of the Knights Membership Blitz styled &quot;Go Roman Week&quot;. The name is a play on the fact that most fraternities on college campuses are given Greek alphabet designations, while the Knights of Columbus is a Catholic organization. At some Catholic universities, such as the <a href="University_of_St._Thomas_(Texas)" title="wikilink">University of St. Thomas</a>, the Knights are the only fraternity permitted on campus.</p>
<p>Each September the Supreme Council hosts a College Council Conference at their headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut. Each college council can send one representative at the Supreme Council's expense and up to 4 more at their own expense. Awards are given for the greatest increases in membership, the best Youth, Community, Council, Family and Church activities and the overall Outstanding College Council of the year. In 2005 the Outstanding College Council award went to Msgr. Cornelius George O'Keefe Council 8250 at the <a href="U.S._Military_Academy_at_West_Point" title="wikilink">U.S. Military Academy at West Point</a>. In years of an international <a href="World_Youth_Day" title="wikilink">World Youth Day</a> the Order is represented by members of the College Council Conference Coordinating Committee. They travel with the diocese of the Supreme Chaplain, currently Bishop <a href="William_E._Lori" title="wikilink">William E. Lori</a> of the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Bridgeport" title="wikilink">Diocese of Bridgeport</a>.</p>
<h2 id="emblems-of-the-order">Emblems of the Order</h2>
<p><img src="Kofc.gif" title="fig:Third Degree Emblem" alt="Third Degree Emblem" /> At the second Supreme Council meeting on <a href="May_12" title="wikilink">May 12</a>, <a href="1883" class="uri" title="wikilink">1883</a> Supreme Knight <a href="James_T._Mullen" title="wikilink">James T. Mullen</a> introduced the emblem of the Order. It consists of a shield mounted upon a Form&lt;U+00E9&gt;e cross. The Form&lt;U+00E9&gt;e cross, with its arms expanding at the ends, is an artistic representation of the <a href="Christian_cross" title="wikilink">cross of Christ</a>. The shield harkens back to medieval <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knights</a> and the cross represents the Catholicity of the Order. Mounted on the shield is a <a href="fasces" class="uri" title="wikilink">fasces</a> with an anchor and a <a href="short_sword" title="wikilink">short sword</a> crossed behind it. The fasces is a symbol of authority while the anchor is the <a href="mariner" class="uri" title="wikilink">mariner</a>'s symbol for Columbus. The sword, like the shield it is mounted on, was used by knights of yesteryear when engaged upon an errand of mercy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Each Knight receives the emblem as a lapel pin. <img src="Fourth_degree.gif" title="fig:Fourth Degree Emblem" alt="Fourth Degree Emblem" width="200" /></p>
<p>Three elements form the emblem of the Fourth Degree. A dove floats over a globe showing the <a href="Western_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Western Hemisphere</a>, the New World Columbus is credited with discovering. Both are mounted on the Isabella cross, a variation of the <a href="Maltese_cross" title="wikilink">Maltese cross</a> with knobs at the end of each of the 8 points. This cross was often was <a href="Crusades#Usage_of_the_term_.22crusade.22" title="wikilink">found</a> on the tunics and capes of the <a href="Crusade" title="wikilink">crusading</a> knights who fought for the <a href="Holy_Land" title="wikilink">Holy Land</a>.</p>
<p>Spiritually, the symbols of the emblem symbolize the <a href="Trinity" title="wikilink">three persons</a> of God. The Globe represents <a href="God_the_Father" title="wikilink">God the Father</a>, Creator of the Universe. The Cross is symbolic of <a href="God_the_Son" title="wikilink">God the Son</a>, who redeemed mankind by dying on the cross, and the Dove represents <a href="God_the_Holy_Spirit" title="wikilink">God the Holy Spirit</a>, the Sanctifier of Humanity. The colors of the emblem, the red cross, white dove and blue earth are the colors of the <a href="flag_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">flag of the United States</a>, where the Order was founded. The elements serve as a reminder that the principle of the Degree is <a href="patriotism" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriotism</a> but also that the Order is thoroughly Catholic.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="March_sign.jpg" title="fig:Tens of thousands of Knights of Columbus placards are handed out at the March For Life." alt="Tens of thousands of Knights of Columbus placards are handed out at the March For Life." /> While the Knights of Columbus are staunch supporters of political awareness and activity, councils are prohibited from engaging in candidate endorsement and partisan political activity. Public policy activity is limited to issue-specific campaigns, typically dealing with Catholic family and <a href="Culture_of_Life" title="wikilink">life</a> issues.</p>
<p>In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, the Knights of Columbus often adopts <a href="social_conservatism" title="wikilink">socially conservative</a> positions on public issues. They have adopted resolutions advocating a <a href="Culture_of_Life" title="wikilink">Culture of Life</a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, defining <a href="marriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">marriage</a> as the union of one man and one woman<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, and protecting religious expression in public schools, government, and voluntary organizations such as the <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts of America</a>. The Order also funded a postcard campaign in 2005 in an attempt to stop the <a href="Canadian_parliament" title="wikilink">Canadian parliament</a> from legalizing same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>On <a href="April_9" title="wikilink">April 9</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> the Board of Directors weighed in on &quot;<a href="United_States_immigration_debate" title="wikilink">U.S. immigration policy</a> [which] has become an intensely debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. and <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>.&quot; They called &quot;upon the President and the U.S. Congress to agree upon immigration legislation that not only gains control over the process of immigration, but also rejects any effort to criminalize those who provide <a href="humanitarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanitarian</a> assistance to undocumented <a href="immigrant" title="wikilink">immigrants</a>, and provides these immigrants an avenue by which they can emerge from the shadows of society and seek legal <a href="residency" class="uri" title="wikilink">residency</a> and <a href="citizenship" class="uri" title="wikilink">citizenship</a> in the U.S.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1954, <a href="lobbying" class="uri" title="wikilink">lobbying</a> by the Order helped convince the <a href="Congress_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a> to add the phrase &quot;under God&quot; to the <a href="Pledge_of_Allegiance" title="wikilink">Pledge of Allegiance</a>.

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>Some public colleges refuse to recognize Knights of Columbus Councils as official student organizations because the men-only membership policy is considered discriminatory. The Supreme Council issues Charters to qualifying groups despite lack of college recognition and the students often get around the anti-discrimination policy. Clubs named the &quot;Friends of the Knights of Columbus&quot; are open to all students and they then sponsor meeting space for the Council.</p>
<p>The Order was often accused of being <a href="racist" class="uri" title="wikilink">racist</a> during the early half of the 20th century. While nothing prohibited black men from joining and the membership application did not ask what race the candidate was, black men were often turned down. During this time five negative votes on a membership application resulted in the applicant being rejected. While some Councils were integrated, increasing pressure came from Church officials and organizations to change its <a href="Blackball_(blacklist)" title="wikilink">blackball</a> system. Supreme Knight <a href="Luke_E._Hart" title="wikilink">Luke E. Hart</a>, while &quot;far from an enthusiastic integrationist,&quot; was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates by the end of the 1950s.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1963 Hart attended a special meeting at the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> hosted by President <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a> to discuss <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> with other religious leaders. A few months later a <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a> alumnus' application was rejected because he was black. Six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news. Hart then declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1964 Supreme Convention was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>. A few days before the Convention new Supreme Knight <a href="John_W._McDevitt" title="wikilink">John W. McDevitt</a> learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another hotel. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require one-third of those voting to reject a new member and in 1972 the Supreme Convention again amended its rules to require a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, a local Knights of Columbus Council in Canada was <a href="http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/decisions/2005/pdf/Smith_and_Chymyshyn_v_Knights_of_Columbus_and_others_2005_BCHRT_544.pdf">fined $2,000</a> by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal for refusing to rent their hall to lesbians Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshynto. The Council's Hall Manager signed a contract with the women but canceled it after they became aware that it was for a same-sex wedding.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The couple claims to they were unaware that the facility was affiliated with the Catholic Church. The local council responds that the hall is on the same compound as a parish church and there were Catholic symbols such as a picture of the Pope and a <a href="crucifix" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifix</a> inside.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The tribunal ruled the Council was <a href="Status_of_religious_freedom_in_Canada#Unresolved_legal_disputes" title="wikilink">within its rights</a> to refuse to rent it based on their religious convictions but fined them &quot;for injury to dignity, feelings and self-respect&quot; of the women.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-similar-organizations">Other Similar Organizations</h2>

<p>Many councils also have women's auxiliaries. However, the Supreme Council does not charter them and they may adopt any name they choose. At the turn of the 20th Century two were formed by local councils and each took the name The <strong>Daughters of Isabella.</strong> Using the same name, both groups expanded and issued charters to other Circles but never merged. The newer organization renamed itself The <strong>Catholic Daughters of the Americas</strong> in 1921 and both have structures independent of the Knights of Columbus.</p>
