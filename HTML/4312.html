<p><strong>Qwest Field</strong> (pronounced ) is a <a href="multi-purpose_stadium" title="wikilink">multi-purpose stadium</a> in <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>, Washington, United States. It serves as the home field for the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a> of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> (NFL) and <a href="Seattle_Sounders_FC" title="wikilink">Seattle Sounders FC</a> of <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). It was originally called <strong>Seahawks Stadium</strong> but was renamed in June 2004 when the telecommunications carrier <a href="Qwest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qwest</a> acquired naming rights. The complex also includes the Event Center with the WaMu Theater, a parking garage, and a public <a href="plaza" class="uri" title="wikilink">plaza</a>. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile (1.6 km) of Seattle's central business district, the venue is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.</p>
<p>The stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held on June 17, 1997. This vote created the <a href="Washington_State_Public_Stadium_Authority" title="wikilink">Washington State Public Stadium Authority</a> to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, <a href="Paul_Allen" title="wikilink">Paul Allen</a>, formed First &amp; Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere. The stadium is a modern facility with views of the nearby Seattle area. The stadium can seat 67,000 people.</p>
<p>The crowd at Qwest Field is notoriously loud during Seahawks games. The noise has contributed to the team's <a href="Home_advantage" title="wikilink">home field advantage</a> with an increase in <a href="false_start" title="wikilink">false start</a> (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) penalties against visiting teams.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a <a href="FieldTurf" class="uri" title="wikilink">FieldTurf</a> <a href="artificial_turf" title="wikilink">artificial field</a>. Numerous college and high school <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> games have also been played at the stadium.</p>
<p>Qwest Field was also designed for <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">soccer</a>; the first sporting event held was a <a href="United_Soccer_Leagues" title="wikilink">United Soccer Leagues (USL)</a> <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(USL)" title="wikilink">Seattle Sounders</a> match. The USL team began regularly using the stadium for home games in 2003. The local <a href="Expansion_of_Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">MLS expansion</a> team, Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. Qwest Field was the site of the <a href="MLS_Cup_2009" title="wikilink">MLS Cup</a> in 2009.</p>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p>The Seahawks played their home games at the <a href="Kingdome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kingdome</a> from their inaugural season between the <a href="1976_Seattle_Seahawks_season" title="wikilink">1976</a> and <a href="1999_Seattle_Seahawks_season" title="wikilink">1999 seasons</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1995, a proposal was made to issue <a href="King_County,_Washington" title="wikilink">county</a> <a href="Bond_(finance)" title="wikilink">bonds</a> to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner <a href="Ken_Behring" title="wikilink">Ken Behring</a> threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997, local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the <a href="Washington_State_Legislature" title="wikilink">state legislature</a> to hold a special statewide <a href="referendum" class="uri" title="wikilink">referendum</a> on a proposal to finance a new stadium.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> With Allen agreeing to pay the $4 million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997, but in May, a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the <a href="Eastern_Washington" title="wikilink">eastern portion</a> of the state.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In October, a <a href="Thurston_County,_Washington" title="wikilink">Thurston County</a> <a href="Superior_Court" title="wikilink">Superior Court</a> judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit.

<p>Voter approval of the referendum created a public&lt;U+2013&gt;private partnership.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The <a href="Washington_State_Public_Stadium_Authority" title="wikilink">Washington State Public Stadium Authority</a> was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First &amp; Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430 million. Of this cost, $44 million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26 million for the parking garage, and $360 million for the stadium. First &amp; Goal was to pay up to $130 million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $360 million.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <img src="Qwest_Field_north.jpg" title="fig:The north gate of the stadium" alt="The north gate of the stadium" width="260" /> The public funding package included new sports-related state <a href="Washington&#39;s_Lottery" title="wikilink">lottery</a> games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the two percent tax on hotel rooms in <a href="King_County,_Washington" title="wikilink">King County</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The taxes on admissions and parking are set at two percent to pay off the project's <a href="Tax_exemption" title="wikilink">tax-exempt</a> bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized ten percent to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At that time, they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 1998, First &amp; Goal signed a 30-year stadium lease that includes <a href="Option_(finance)" title="wikilink">options</a> to extend for another 20.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Per the agreement, the Public Stadium Authority receives $850,000 a year (adjusted for inflation), and First &amp; Goal keeps all revenue from the stadium and parking garage. The company receives 80% of the revenue from the exhibition center while the other twenty percent is allotted to a state education fund. First &amp; Goal is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs, expected to be $6 million a year, and must keep the facility in &quot;first-class&quot; condition. Other details of the lease include the availability of affordable seats, a coordinated effort with neighboring <a href="Safeco_Field" title="wikilink">Safeco Field</a> to prevent <a href="gridlock" class="uri" title="wikilink">gridlock</a>, a provision for naming rights, the investment in public art at the stadium, and the giveaway of a <a href="luxury_suite" title="wikilink">luxury suite</a> to a fan each Seahawks' game.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Qwest_Field_(Seahawks_Stadium)_under_construction_-_2001.jpg" title="fig:The stadium under construction in 2001" alt="The stadium under construction in 2001" width="260" /> The architectural firm <a href="Ellerbe_Becket" title="wikilink">Ellerbe Becket</a>, in association with Loschky Marquardt &amp; Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000 sq ft (140,000 m<sup>2</sup>) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor <a href="Husky_Stadium" title="wikilink">Husky Stadium</a>. His goal was to create a similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14 months by Loschky Marquardt &amp; Nesholm Architects while First &amp; Goal managed the construction.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6 million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81 million were awarded to <a href="Minority_business_enterprise" title="wikilink">minority- and women-owned businesses</a>.

<p>In September 1998, construction began on the new exhibition center and parking garage. By October 1999, the exhibition center was open and hosting events.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> On March 26, 2000, to make way for the stadium, the Kingdome was demolished in the world's largest <a href="Building_implosion" title="wikilink">implosion</a> of a single concrete structure.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Almost all of the Kingdome rubble was recycled with roughly half used for the new stadium. The designers were challenged by the soft soil at the site since it was a <a href="tidal_marsh" title="wikilink">tidal marsh</a> until public works projects in the early 20th century adjusted the waterline of nearby <a href="Elliot_Bay" title="wikilink">Elliot Bay</a>. The top layer is a soft fill taken from the grading projects that had leveled portions of <a href="Seven_hills_of_Seattle" title="wikilink">Seattle's hills</a>. To account for the soft soil, the complex sits on over 2,200 pilings driven  to  below the ground to form what is essentially a pier for the foundation.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Eight individually connected sections were built to account for the soil concerns, temperature effects, and the potential for earthquakes.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The adjoining exhibition center and parking garage are separate structures and not part of the eight-section stadium.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <img src="Aerial_of_Qwest_Field_and_downtown_skyline,_2002.jpg" title="fig: The stadium after completion in 2002" alt=" The stadium after completion in 2002" width="260" /> The site of Qwest Field is the smallest of those developed for new <a href="List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums" title="wikilink">NFL stadiums</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The upper levels were <a href="cantilever" title="wikilink">cantilevered</a> over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and the placement of the lower sections closer to the field, provided a better view of the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000 seat capacity.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 <a href="Club_seating" title="wikilink">club seats</a>. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> , Qwest Field ranks 21st out of the 31 stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The configuration of Qwest Field is a U-shape with an open north end to provide views of <a href="downtown_Seattle" title="wikilink">downtown Seattle</a> and the large north plaza. The large <a href="retractable_roof" title="wikilink">retractable roof</a> of <a href="Safeco_Field" title="wikilink">Safeco Field</a> along with <a href="Mount_Rainier" title="wikilink">Mount Rainier</a> to the southeast can be seen from the partially open south end.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The stadium's <a href="concourse" title="wikilink">concourses</a> were built to be wide, and they provide additional views of the surrounding area.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> A 13-story tower was erected at the north end of the stadium that visually compliments the <a href="List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Seattle" title="wikilink">Seattle skyline</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The tower features a vertically oriented <a href="scoreboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">scoreboard</a> which is the first of its kind in the NFL.

Another addition not previously seen in the NFL are field-level luxury suits located directly behind the north end zone.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Qwest_and_Safeco.jpg" title="fig:The roofs of Qwest Field and Safeco Field" alt="The roofs of Qwest Field and Safeco Field" width="260" /> Allen rejected plans for a retractable roof during the early stages of the stadium's design. The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements, provided better views, and reduced the total cost of the project.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The roof, at 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m<sup>2</sup>),<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The roof spans  between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by <a href="truss" title="wikilink">trusses</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> From above, two arches with additional supports rise  over the field.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <a href="Prestressed_concrete#Unbonded_post-tensioned_concrete" title="wikilink">Post-tensioned</a> cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a <a href="Earthquake_engineering#Seismic_vibration_control" title="wikilink">friction pendulum</a> damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure. The technology had never been applied to a large-scale roof before Qwest Field.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The roof was painted white to aesthetically distinguish it from both Safeco Field and the nearby <a href="Industrial_District,_Seattle" title="wikilink">industrial area</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The east side of the stadium has a large glass <a href="curtain_wall" title="wikilink">curtain wall</a> that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of <a href="Salmon_(color)" title="wikilink">salmon colored</a> concrete, and the west side of the structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>A 6.8 <a href="Moment_magnitude_scale" title="wikilink">M<sub>w</sub></a> <a href="2001_Nisqually_earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a> struck the Seattle area during construction.

FieldTurf won the bid for the second installation over <a href="Polytan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polytan</a>. For the replacement surface, a one inch (two and one half centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First &amp; Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1997 state referendum stated that the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf was not an option when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Seahawks management reconsidered surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the <a href="2000_Seattle_Seahawks_season" title="wikilink">2000</a> and <a href="2001_Seattle_Seahawks_season" title="wikilink">2001</a> seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by <a href="Seattle#Geography" title="wikilink">Seattle's frequent rain</a> also made the surface an appropriate option.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8 million irrigation and heating system would have been required.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The coach of the Seahawks at the time, <a href="Mike_Holmgren" title="wikilink">Mike Holmgren</a>, said FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that &quot;the players love it, and I think this surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Local soccer fans were concerned that the lack of a natural grass field would hinder Seattle's chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> They asserted that voters had approved the facility with the understanding that the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In a compromise, First &amp; Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>There have been various opinions regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches.

<p>Between August and November, both the Seahawks and Sounders FC host games at Qwest Field.

<p>Before the opening of their first <a href="2009_Seattle_Sounders_FC_season" title="wikilink">season</a>, the Sounders already had the highest number of season ticket holders in the MLS after they sold all 22,000 of the offered season ticket packages.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The team created a web site that was used to identify seating arrangements for season ticket holders based on personal interests including preferred method for watching a game and foreign team preference.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> For the first half of the inaugural season, the upper and lower sections were <a href="Tarpaulin" title="wikilink">tarped</a> off to create a more intimate feel and a <a href="seating_capacity" title="wikilink">seating capacity</a> of 27,700.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The stadium was designed to easily open seating sections in stages if needed.

<p>Like the Seahawks, the Sounders are beginning to receive attention for sellout crowds and boisterous <a href="Seattle_Sounders_FC_supporters" title="wikilink">fans</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> <em>The Seattle Times</em> reported that a &quot;new standard for attendance and game-day atmosphere has been set&quot;<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> due to the loud sellout crowds.
