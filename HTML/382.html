<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Bart, Homer and <a href="Milhouse_Van_Houten" title="wikilink">Milhouse</a> attend a Spinal Tap concert, but it turns into a comedy of errors and degenerates into a <a href="riot" class="uri" title="wikilink">riot</a> started by <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_in_The_Simpsons#Snake_Jailbird" title="wikilink">Snake</a>. Nonetheless, Bart is impressed by the aging heavy metal band and wants to become a rock guitarist. Homer and Marge decide to buy Bart his own electric guitar, but Bart struggles to learn how to play it. The next morning on the school bus, Bart tells <a href="Otto_Mann" title="wikilink">Otto</a> he thinks his guitar is broken, and Otto with the bus still stopped in traffic wows his passengers with an impromptu concert, to which he thoughtlessly clogs up traffic by not moving the bus. However, Otto loses track of time and is forced to drive recklessly to school. The bus runs Spinal Taps bus off the road (causing it to crash and burst into flames, presumably killing Spinal Tap), and causes other chaos before turning over onto its side in the town square. Thankfully, no one else is hurt.</p>
<p>Numerous people call <a href="Springfield_Elementary_School" title="wikilink">Springfield Elementary School</a> to report the incident, earning Otto a reprimand from <a href="Principal_Skinner" title="wikilink">Principal Skinner</a>. However, when Officer Lou asks for his <a href="driver&#39;s_license" title="wikilink">driver's license</a> to complete his report, he is forced to admit he doesn't have a license (or wear his own underwear). Otto is suspended without pay, and Skinner takes over his route. Skinner finds driving the bus hard going, being a less aggressive driver than Otto, and ends up being trapped at a busy intersection for an entire day. At first he takes an insulting song the children sing (called &quot;Hail to the Bus Driver&quot;, to the tune of Oh du lieber Augustin) with good humour and even sings along, but after being stuck at the intersection, he becomes irritated and snaps at Ralph Wiggum when he tries to continue singing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, things quickly go downhill for Otto. He fails his driver's test at the Springfield <a href="Department_of_Motor_Vehicles" title="wikilink">DMV</a> (not helped when he asks his examiner, <a href="Patty_and_Selma_Bouvier" title="wikilink">Patty</a> if she was born a man). He is also unable to find a new job, and therefore cannot pay his rent and is evicted from his apartment. Bart finds him living in a Trash Co. Waste Disposal Unit (since Dumpsters are too top-of-the-line for Otto), and agrees to let him live in the Simpsons' garage. Homer and Marge disapprove of this, and Bart tries to convince them that Marge in fact has agreed to let Otto stay, presenting a tape recording where she did so; in reality though, it features Bart doing a poor impression of his mother. Homer and Marge aren't fooled by this, but reluctantly agrees to let him stay.</p>
<p>Otto quickly makes a nuisance of himself. He becomes comfortable lying around watching game shows, playing Bart's guitar at high volume, and hogging the bathroom. When he clogs up a sink with hair while washing in it, Homer begins to lose patience with him. However, Marge convinces him that at least Otto is good with the kids. At that moment, Otto terrifies Lisa with a scary story, and her scream startles everyone. This is the final straw for Homer, that he makes his demands clear to Bart that Otto either leaves or he'll throw him out and calls him a sponge. Otto is now uncertain about his future, even considering faking his own death. However, Marge and Bart encourage him to give the driving test one last try.</p>
<p>Outside the DMV, an underconfident, Otto mentions that Homer's right about him, he's a bum. Bart corrects him by telling him that his father called him a sponge, not a bum and his favorite bus driver is upset. With renewed confidence, determination and hatred for Homer, Otto quickly marches into the DMV to take the test again. Unfortunately, Patty refuses to let him retake the test for his license because of an earlier comment he made about her being born a man(a question he didn't need to ask). However, Otto refuses to give up by telling her that he has something to prove to Homer: that when he gets his driver's license, he wants to have it stapled to his bald, fat head. This immediately changes Patty's demeanor because she realizes that they have something in common with each other: their hatred for Homer. Right away, she gets Otto started on his writing test and even gives him the answers to it.</p>
<p>During his second driving test: in the parking lot, Otto runs over every single cone, but she doesn't care about that. Patty actually laughs while he continues bad-mouthing about Homer and things he does whenever he's alone, with his family and around people. However, he runs over cardboard cut-outs of pedestrians, but she takes no notice and even offers to buy him a margarita. Despite performing even worse in his second test, Patty grants Otto his license anyway, allowing him to regain his job. Otto proudly shows off his license to Bart, which has a big red stamp of &quot;PROBATIONARY&quot;. As Otto drives off into the sunset running two stop signs, with the children singing &quot;Hail to the Bus Driver&quot;, Skinner proudly remarks, &quot;Yes, hail to the bus driver, bus driver man.&quot;</p>

According to executive producer Al Jean, the executives at Fox were unhappy about having the band guest star, partially because it cost a lot of money to purchase rights to play their songs.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Mike_Reiss" title="wikilink">Mike Reiss</a> said that Fox felt that the show could have gotten a &quot;real group&quot; for that amount of money.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The animators gave many of the members of the crowd at the Spinal Tap concert long bangs, so they would not have to animate many pairs of eyes.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the final scene to feature the band, their tour bus bursts into flames after being knocked off the road. According to the writers, the scene was not in the original script and was added because they felt the band's final scene was not interesting enough.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In its original airing on the Fox Network, the episode had an 11.5 <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating</a> and was viewed in approximately 10.59 million homes. It finished the week of April 20&lt;U+2013&gt;26, 1992 ranked 41st, up from the season's average rank of 35th.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>The Simpsons</em> was the fourth highest rated show on Fox that week after <em><a href="Married..._with_Children" title="wikilink">Married... with Children</a></em>, <em><a href="Beverly_Hills,_90210" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em> and <em><a href="In_Living_Color" title="wikilink">In Living Color</a></em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode, like the whole of the third season, received mostly positive reviews from critics. The authors of the book <em>I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide</em>, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, &quot;A nice episode for Otto and some great moments for Skinner as he tries to drive the bus, but especially memorable for Homer's moment of forgetfulness after the concert. Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer reprise their roles from <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> perfectly.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> MovieFreak.com's Dennis Landmann named &quot;The Otto Show&quot; as one of the stand-out episodes from the third season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Bryce Wilson, in his review of the third season for <a href="Cinema_Blend" title="wikilink">Cinema Blend</a>, wrote &quot;Simpson&lt;U+2019&gt;s voice actor Harry Shearer...reunites Spinal Tap just for &quot;The Otto Show&quot;, an episode full of the trademark Tap banter and stage disasters that rival even the mighty 18 inch Stonehenge.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> named Spinal Tap as the '18th best guest stars' in the show's history for this episode.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed was also positive about the episode, giving it a rating of five donuts out of five and writing &quot;The writing is at full throttle here, cramming tons of jokes into the episode's 20-minute runtime with stunning success.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that it was &quot;another solid episode. Actually, it regresses somewhat from the high quality of its predecessors. The Spinal Tap material feels somewhat tacky &lt;U+2013&gt; it was a tie-in with their then-current attempt to sell a new album &lt;U+2013&gt; and Otto's not a strong character. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t think the series ever made him the lead again, and he works best in small doses. &quot;Otto: remains very good, but it doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t compete with the year&lt;U+2019&gt;s best shows.&quot;&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
