<p><strong>Brian Charles Booth</strong> (born 19 October 1933) is a former <a href="Australian_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australian cricketer</a> who played in 29 <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Tests</a> from 1961 to 1966. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 1965–66 Ashes series while regular captain <a href="Bob_Simpson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bob Simpson</a> was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm <a href="pace_bowling" title="wikilink">medium pace</a> or <a href="off_spin" title="wikilink">off spin</a>. He was of modest height and had an inclination to use his feet to charge <a href="spin_bowling" title="wikilink">spin bowlers</a>. Booth was also a member of the Australian <a href="field_hockey" title="wikilink">field hockey</a> team that competed at the <a href="1956_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1956 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>.</p>
<p>Born near the New South Wales country town of Bathurst, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and played in the <a href="Sydney_Grade_Cricket" title="wikilink">grade cricket</a> competition while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Englishmen</a> in 1954–55. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice and had to be called from work on the morning of the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to prepare for the 1956 Olympics. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 1957–58, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 1959–60 Australian Second XI tour to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Booth was selected for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played in the final two Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two centuries in the 1962–63 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries in the following summer against <a href="South_African_cricket_team" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of <a href="Richie_Benaud" title="wikilink">Richie Benaud</a>, Booth was appointed as the vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of <a href="the_Ashes" title="wikilink">the Ashes</a>. Booth played his final Test series in 1965–66 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and <a href="chickenpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">chickenpox</a> respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. Booth was known for his sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.</p>

<p>The son of &quot;Snowy&quot; Booth, a market gardener and talented country cricketer,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Booth was born in Perthville, located  outside the New South Wales regional town of <a href="Bathurst,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bathurst</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His father hung pictures of <a href="Don_Bradman" title="wikilink">Don Bradman</a> and <a href="Stan_McCabe" title="wikilink">Stan McCabe</a> on the wall and told him that &quot;these are the two greatest living cricketers&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Booth represented <a href="Bathurst_High_School_(Bathurst,_New_South_Wales)" title="wikilink">Bathurst High School</a> at the age of 13 and played first grade cricket in Bathurst at 15. He was selected for a New South Wales youth country side at the age of just 14. In 1950, Booth represented New South Wales Country against a combined Sydney team, and moved to <a href="St._George_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">St. George</a> to play on a weekly basis two years later.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He made the first grade team at the age of 19 and began a four-year course at <a href="Sydney_Teachers_College" title="wikilink">Sydney Teachers College</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Booth also played hockey in Perthville and began playing for St. George upon his arrival in Sydney.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Booth made his first-class debut for <a href="New_South_Wales_Blues" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> against <a href="Queensland_Bulls" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> in the 1954–55 <a href="Sheffield_Shield" title="wikilink">Sheffield Shield</a>.

He caught a train and arrived at the ground more than half an hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and bat to join <a href="Peter_Philpott" title="wikilink">Peter Philpott</a>. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men.

<p>Booth had a low key season in 1955–56, struggling to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. As there were no international matches during the summer,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and had few opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Booth was selected for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956 in preparation for the Olympics.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received out of pocket expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible to participate in the Olympics.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers <a href="Ian_Dick" title="wikilink">Ian Dick</a> and <a href="Maurice_Foley_(Australian_sportsman)" title="wikilink">Maurice Foley</a> were cleared to play for Australia.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Booth then missed the 1956–57 <a href="Sheffield_Shield" title="wikilink">Sheffield Shield</a> season because he was part of the Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the <a href="Australia_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1956 Olympics</a> in <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Booth was selected as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1957–58, the Australian Test team toured South Africa during the southern hemisphere summer,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> opening up opportunities in the Shield competition back in Australia.

<p>Despite Booth's views being more genteel than that of most of his team-mates, there was minimal friction or disconnect.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a <a href="Melbourne_Cup" title="wikilink">Melbourne Cup</a> gambling sweep organised by captain <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a>. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him to look after the money.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> Booth said &quot;That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team.&quot;<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> He added &quot;The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them.&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
