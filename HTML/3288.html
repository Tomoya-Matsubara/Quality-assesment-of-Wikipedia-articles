<p><strong><em>Jeopardy!</em></strong> is an American television <a href="game_show" title="wikilink">game show</a> created by <a href="Merv_Griffin" title="wikilink">Merv Griffin</a>. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in question form. The original daytime version aired on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> from March 30, 1964 to January 3, 1975, then spawned a weekly nighttime <a href="Broadcast_syndication" title="wikilink">syndicated</a> edition that aired from September 9, 1974 to September 5, 1975, and was later revived as <em>The All-New Jeopardy!</em>, which ran from October 2, 1978 to March 2, 1979. The program's most successful incarnation is the daily syndicated version, which premiered on September 10, 1984.</p>
<p>Both NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by <a href="Art_Fleming" title="wikilink">Art Fleming</a>. <a href="Don_Pardo" title="wikilink">Don Pardo</a> served as announcer until 1975, and <a href="John_Harlan_(announcer)" title="wikilink">John Harlan</a> announced for the 1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79 show. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured <a href="Alex_Trebek" title="wikilink">Alex Trebek</a> as host and <a href="Johnny_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Johnny Gilbert</a> as announcer. Trebek is expected to retire from the program in 2016, at which point his tenure as host will have lasted for 32 years.</p>
<p>With over 6,000 episodes aired as of May 2011,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the daily syndicated version of <em>Jeopardy!</em> has won a record 31 <a href="Daytime_Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Daytime Emmy Awards</a> and a <a href="Peabody_Award" title="wikilink">Peabody Award</a>. <a href="Game_Show_Network" title="wikilink">Game Show Network</a> (GSN) ranked the show number 2 on its 2006 list of the 50 greatest game shows, and <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> ranked it number 1 in its 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows ever. The program has gained a worldwide following with <a href="Jeopardy!_broadcast_information#International_adaptations" title="wikilink">regional adaptations</a> in many foreign countries. The 30th season of the daily syndicated version of <em>Jeopardy!</em> premiered on September 16, 2013.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>Three contestants take their place behind three lecterns, each equipped with a <a href="lock-out_device" title="wikilink">lock-out device</a> and a screen with a <a href="light_pen" title="wikilink">light pen</a>. During non-tournament games, the returning champion occupies the leftmost lectern from the viewer's perspective. The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy! The material for the questions covers a wide variety of topics (including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages), and there are pun-laden titles (many of which refer to the standard subjects), wordplay categories, and even entire sets of categories with a common theme.</p>
<h3 id="first-two-rounds">First two rounds</h3>

<img src="Jeopardy_game_board.png" title="The basic layout of the Jeopardy! game board, using the dollar values from the first round" alt="The basic layout of the Jeopardy! game board, using the dollar values from the first round" width="255" /><figcaption>The basic layout of the <em>Jeopardy!</em> game board, using the dollar values from the first round</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories which each contain a column of five clues (phrased in answer form), each clue incrementally valued more than the previous, ostensibly by difficulty. The value of each clue within categories has changed over time: on the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series, the Jeopardy! round clue values ranged from $10 to $50 in increments of $10; on <em>The All-New Jeopardy!</em>, they ranged from $25 to $125 in $25 increments; on the daily syndicated version, the Jeopardy! round clue values originally ranged from $100 to $500 in increments of $100, but were doubled in value on November 26, 2001;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and on the <em>Super Jeopardy!</em> specials, where clue values were in points rather than in dollars, the Jeopardy! round clue values ranged from 200 to 1,000 points in 200-point increments.</p>
<p>The returning champion selects the first clue in the Jeopardy! round from any position on the game board. The selected clue is revealed and read by the host, after which any of the three contestants may ring-in using a hand-held signalling device. The first contestant to ring-in successfully after the host has read the clue must then provide a response phrased in the form of a question; for example, if a contestant were to select &quot;Presidents for $200&quot;, the resulting clue could be &quot;The Father of Our Country, he didn't really chop down a cherry tree&quot;, to which the contestant's response should be &quot;Who is George Washington?&quot; A correct response adds the dollar value of the clue to the contestant's score and gives them the opportunity to select the next clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within a time limit of five seconds, deducts the dollar value of the clue from the contestant's score and gives the other opponent(s) the opportunity to ring-in and respond. If none of the contestants give a correct response, the host reads the correct response and the contestant who selected the previous clue chooses the next clue.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Contestants must wait until the host finishes reading the clue before signalling; doing so before this point locks the contestant out for one-fourth of a second. Originally, contestants were allowed to ring-in at any time after the clue had been revealed, but that rule was changed when the Trebek version's second season premiered in 1985, both to allow home viewers to play along more easily and to decrease the likelihood of faster contestants dominating the game. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board to signify when it was permissible to signal. Pre-1985 <em>Jeopardy!</em> episodes featured a buzzer that would sound whenever someone signalled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was silenced because it was &quot;distracting to the viewers&quot; and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in before he could finish reading the clue.</p>
<p>The Double Jeopardy! round, as its name implies, features clue values that are exactly double the Jeopardy! round values (except during <em>Super Jeopardy!</em>, in which the clue values ranged from 500&lt;U+2013&gt;2500 points in 500-point increments). The contestant with the least money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> If there is a tie for second place or a three-way tie for first place, the contestant with the tied score standing at the leftmost lectern selects first. With the exception of the final two games of a tournament, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game before Final Jeopardy! and awarded the third place prize. During <em>Celebrity Jeopardy!</em> games, a contestant who finishes Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score is given $1,000 to wager in Final Jeopardy! On at least one episode hosted by Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and, as a result, no Final Jeopardy! was played that day.</p>
<p>One clue hidden on the Jeopardy! round game board, and two on the Double Jeopardy! board, are &quot;Daily Doubles&quot;, taking their name and inspiration from a <a href="horse_racing" title="wikilink">horse racing</a> <a href="Daily_double" title="wikilink">term</a>. Only the contestant who selects a Daily Double may respond. The contestant must first decide how much to wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of all of their money (known as a &quot;true Daily Double&quot;) or the highest dollar clue in the round, whichever is greater.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The contestant maintains control of the board and the right to select the subsequent clue, regardless of whether or not their response is correct.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Daily Doubles accompanied by audio or video elements are appropriately tagged.</p>
<p>During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase a response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing on future clues. During the Double Jeopardy! round, and on the Daily Double clue in the Jeopardy! round, adherence to the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, but contestants are still permitted to correct themselves before their time runs out. If it is determined that a response previously given by a contestant was wrongly ruled correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.</p>
<h3 id="final-jeopardy">Final Jeopardy!</h3>
<p>Once the Double Jeopardy! round is concluded, the Final Jeopardy! category is announced by the host, and a commercial break follows. During the break, barriers are placed to separate each of the contestant lecterns from one another, and each contestant is asked to make one final wager (between $0 and their total score), writing it down on the electronic display using the light pen. After the final commercial break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants are given a time limit of thirty seconds to write their responses, again phrased in the form of a question, while the iconic <a href="Jeopardy!#Theme_music" title="wikilink">&quot;Think!&quot; music</a> plays in the background. Contestants who provide the correct response are awarded the values of their respective wagers. Contestants who fail to provide the correct response, or to phrase their response in the form of a question (even if the response itself is correct), have that amount subtracted from their scores.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>During a tournament's opening or semifinal round, if two or all three contestants are tied for first place with a positive score at the conclusion of Final Jeopardy!, there is a one-clue ring-in tiebreaker. The tied contestants are presented with a category and the clue is then revealed. The first contestant to ring in and provide the correct response becomes the champion and advances to the next round of play. Contestants are not eliminated from play for providing an incorrect response and are not allowed to win by default. If a tournament game ends in a three-way tie for zero, all three contestants are eliminated, and the highest scoring of the remaining players advances to the next round.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> If a tournament finalist finishes Double Jeopardy! with a zero or negative score on either day, that contestant is eliminated from Final Jeopardy! as usual and their score for that day is recorded as zero.</p>
<h3 id="winnings">Winnings</h3>
<p>The top scorer on each episode retains his or her winnings and returns as the champion in the next match, and non-winners receive consolation prizes. Since the show does not provide airfare or lodging for most contestants (with the exception of returning champions who have to make multiple flights to the Los Angeles area), these cash consolation prizes alleviate the financial burden of appearing on the show.</p>
<p>Since May 16, 2002, the show's consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> On pre-2002 episodes of the Trebek version, consolation prizes for the non-winners typically included vacation packages and merchandise; the merchandise prizes were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration, so as to keep production costs low. On the Fleming versions, all three contestants kept their winnings, and contestants who finished the game with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes. When the Trebek version began, the show's producers decided to award full winnings only to the champion in order to make the game more competitive; some Fleming-era contestants would occasionally decide that they only wanted to win a certain amount of money and then stop participating in the game when they reached that amount, or not respond to Final Jeopardy! if another contestant had a significant lead.</p>
<h3 id="returning-champions">Returning champions</h3>
<p>If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, nobody wins and three new contestants appear on the following show. In such cases, the three new contestants participate in a backstage draw to determine their positions at the contestant lecterns. There have been episodes featuring regular-play games without any contestants finishing Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, such as the second episode of the Trebek version, aired September 11, 1984,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> the episode aired March 2, 1998,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and the episode aired June 12, 1998.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In addition, all three players scored zero during a semi-final match of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In regular play, if two or three contestants tie for first place, they are declared co-champions; each retains his or her winnings and returns on the following episode. Contestants who have finished two games as co-champions have included Dane Garrett in Season 2, Sara Cox in Season 7, Dan Girard in Season 14, and Kristin Morgan in Season 29.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A three-way tie for first place has only occurred once on the Trebek version&lt;U+2014&gt;on March 16, 2007, when Scott Weiss, Jamey Kirby, and Anders Martinson ended the game with $16,000.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Special considerations are given for contestants who are unable to return as champion due to circumstances beyond their control, such as illness, military commitments, or unusual delays. This occurred for the first time in Season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to make the taping of the next episode because of illness; three new contestants appeared on the next episode which aired on January 19, 2009, with Trebek explaining at the top of the episode that in such a case, the contestant would return at a later date as a co-champion.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Ball returned on the episode that aired April 9, 2009.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Before 2003, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; three new contestants would appear on the following show. The total cash winnings of the daily syndicated version's champions were originally limited to $75,000, but this limit was increased to $200,000 at the start of the 14th syndicated season in 1997.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The limits on champions' appearances and winnings were eliminated at the beginning of Season 20 on September 8, 2003.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="earnings-records">Earnings records</h3>
<p><em>Jeopardy!</em>{{-'}}s record for the longest winning streak is held by <a href="Ken_Jennings" title="wikilink">Ken Jennings</a>, who, taking advantage of the newly implemented rule changes explained above, competed on the show from June 2 through November 30, 2004, winning 74 matches before being defeated by Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance. He amassed $2,520,700 over his 74 wins and a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance. He earned the record as the <a href="American_game_show_winnings_records#Top_ten_winnings_list" title="wikilink">highest money-winner ever on American game shows</a>, and his winning streak increased the show's ratings and popularity to the point where it became TV's highest-rated syndicated program.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Jennings later won the $500,000 second-place prize in the <a href="Jeopardy!_Ultimate_Tournament_of_Champions" title="wikilink">Ultimate Tournament of Champions</a>, half of a $300,000 prize in the <a href="List_of_Jeopardy!_tournaments_and_events#IBM_Challenge" title="wikilink">IBM Challenge</a>, and the $100,000 second-place prize in the <a href="Jeopardy!_Battle_of_the_Decades" title="wikilink">Battle of the Decades</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest all-time money winner on <em>Jeopardy!</em> is <a href="Brad_Rutter" title="wikilink">Brad Rutter</a>, who has won a cumulative total of $4,355,102 on the show.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He became an undefeated champion in 2000 and later won an unprecedented four <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournaments: the 2001 <a href="Jeopardy!_Tournament_of_Champions" title="wikilink">Tournament of Champions</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the <a href="List_of_Jeopardy!_tournaments_and_events#&quot;All-time_best&quot;_tournaments" title="wikilink">Million Dollar Masters Tournament</a>, the Ultimate Tournament of Champions,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the Battle of the Decades. Following his third tournament win, in which he defeated Jennings and <a href="Jerome_Vered" title="wikilink">Jerome Vered</a> in the finals, Rutter broke Jennings's all-time game show winnings record. Jennings later regained the record by appearing on various other game shows, culminating in an appearance on <em><a href="Are_You_Smarter_than_a_5th_Grader?_(U.S._game_show)" title="wikilink">Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?</a></em> on October 10, 2008. Rutter regained the title in 2014 after winning $1,000,000 in the Battle of the Decades, defeating Jennings and <a href="Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)" title="wikilink">Roger Craig</a> in the finals.</p>
<p>The all-time record for single-day winnings on <em>Jeopardy!</em> is held by <a href="Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)" title="wikilink">Roger Craig</a>. On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game's first two rounds, then wagered and won an additional $30,000 in the Final Jeopardy! round, finishing with $77,000, breaking the previous single-day record of $75,000 which had been held by Jennings.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The record-holder among female contestants on <em>Jeopardy!</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;in both number of games and total winnings&lt;U+2014&gt;is <a href="Julia_Collins_(Jeopardy!_contestant)" title="wikilink">Julia Collins</a>, who amassed $429,100 over 21 games between April 21 and June 2, 2014. She won $428,100 in her 20 games as champion, plus $1,000 for finishing third in her twenty-first game.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Collins also achieved the second-longest winning streak on the show, behind Ken Jennings. The streak, which was interrupted in May by the Battle of the Decades, was broken by Brian Loughnane.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The highest one-day score in a Celebrity <em>Jeopardy!</em> tournament was achieved by comedian <a href="Andy_Richter" title="wikilink">Andy Richter</a> during a first round game of the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 season's &quot;Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational&quot;, in which he finished with $68,000 for his selected charity, the <a href="St._Jude_Children&#39;s_Research_Hospital" title="wikilink">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Only three contestants on pre-2002 episodes of the Trebek version won a game with the lowest amount possible ($1).

<h3 id="production-staff">Production staff</h3>
<p>Robert Rubin served as the producer of the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series for most of its run, then later became its executive producer.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Show creator <a href="Merv_Griffin" title="wikilink">Merv Griffin</a> was the Trebek version's executive producer until his retirement in 2000.

<h3 id="conception">Conception</h3>
<p>In a 1964 <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> profile released right before the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series premiered, Griffin offered the following account of the quiz show's origins: </p>
<p><em>Jeopardy!</em> was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions; that format had previously been used by the <a href="Gil_Fates" title="wikilink">Gil Fates</a>-hosted program <em><a href="CBS_Television_Quiz" title="wikilink">CBS Television Quiz</a></em>, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942. Griffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not be shown on camera easily, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories. He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting &quot;Who is...&quot; for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form. Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, <em>What's the Question?</em>, when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, &quot;It doesn't have enough <a href="wikt:jeopardy" title="wikilink">jeopardies</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="audition-process">Audition process</h3>

<p><img src="Jeopardy_Brain_Bus.jpg" title="fig:The Jeopardy! Brain Bus" alt="The Jeopardy! Brain Bus" width="200" /> Prospective contestants of the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series called the show's office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Successful auditioners were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.</p>
<p>The Trebek version's prospective contestants are given a written exam which comprises fifty questions in total; the number of questions in each topic covered has been modified throughout the years. Participants who pass the exam by providing at least thirty-five correct responses advance in the audition process and compete in mock games. Originally held only in southern California, the show's contestant searches have been conducted regionally (sponsored by local affiliates that air the program) since 1985. Invitations to audition were originally awarded by postcard drawings and other types of contests, but more recently, prospective contestants have been able to obtain the location of regional contestant searches or register to participate in an online test on the official website. Since Season 15 (1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99), the show has used a <a href="Winnebago_Industries" title="wikilink">Winnebago</a> recreational vehicle called the &quot;Jeopardy! Brain Bus&quot; measuring , to conduct regional contestant searches throughout the United States and Canada. Attendees not wishing to compete for a chance to appear on the show can play a shortened game of <em>Jeopardy!</em> to win merchandise related to the show.</p>
<h3 id="theme-music">Theme music</h3>
<p>Since the debut of <em>Jeopardy!</em> in 1964, several different songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show, most of which were composed by Griffin. The main theme for the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series was &quot;Take Ten&quot;,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> composed by Griffin's wife Julann.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> <em>The All-New Jeopardy!</em> opened with &quot;January, February, March&quot; and closed with &quot;Frisco Disco&quot;, both of which were composed by Griffin himself.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The best-known theme song on <em>Jeopardy!</em> is &quot;Think!&quot;, originally composed by Griffin under the title &quot;A Time for Tony&quot;, as a lullaby for his son.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> &quot;Think!&quot; has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song. &quot;Think!&quot; has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings. Griffin estimated that the use of &quot;Think!&quot; had earned him royalties of over $70 million throughout his lifetime.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> &quot;Think!&quot; led Griffin to win the <a href="Broadcast_Music,_Inc." title="wikilink">Broadcast Music, Inc.</a> (BMI) President's Award in 2003,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and during GSN's <em><a href="2009_Game_Show_Awards" title="wikilink">2009 Game Show Awards</a></em> special, it was named &quot;Best Game Show Theme Song&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The main theme and Final Jeopardy! recordings of &quot;Think!&quot; were later rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as the show's music director until his 2003 death,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and when the show began its 25th season in 2008, the <em>Jeopardy!</em> music package was given a complete overhaul by Chris Bell Music and Sound Design.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected values in each category. <em>The All-New Jeopardy!</em>{{-'}}s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991, and in 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by <a href="Sony_Electronics" title="wikilink">Sony Electronics</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1985&lt;U+2013&gt;97, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. At the beginning of Season 8 in 1991, a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid. On the episode aired November 11, 1996, two months after the start of Season 13, <em>Jeopardy!</em> introduced the first of several sets designed by Slodki, who intended the set to resemble &quot;the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite&quot;. Shortly after the start of Season 19 in 2002, the show switched to yet another new set, which was given slight modifications when <em>Jeopardy!</em> and <em>Wheel</em> transitioned to <a href="high-definition_television" title="wikilink">high-definition broadcasting</a> in 2006.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> During this time, the show began to feature <a href="virtual_tour" title="wikilink">virtual tours</a> of the set on its official web site.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The various high-definition improvements for <em>Jeopardy!</em> and <em>Wheel</em> represented a combined investment of approximately $4 million, 5,000 hours of labor, and  of cable.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD. On <a href="standard-definition_television" title="wikilink">standard-definition television</a> broadcasts, the shows continue to be displayed with an <a href="Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="wikilink">aspect ratio</a> of 4:3.</p>
<p>In 2009, <em>Jeopardy!</em> once again switched to a new set. It debuted with special episodes taped at the 42nd annual <a href="International_CES" title="wikilink">International CES</a> technology trade show, hosted at the <a href="Las_Vegas_Convention_Center" title="wikilink">Las Vegas Convention Center</a> in <a href="Winchester,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Winchester</a> (<a href="Las_Vegas_Valley" title="wikilink">Las Vegas Valley</a>), <a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a>, and became the primary set for <em>Jeopardy!</em> when the show began taping its 26th season, which premiered on September 14, 2009.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> It was significantly remodeled at the start of Season 30 in 2013.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="broadcast">Broadcast</h2>

<p>The original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series premiered on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> on March 30, 1964, and garnered the second-highest ratings among daytime game shows by the end of the 1960s, second only to <em><a href="Hollywood_Squares" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Squares</a></em>. The show was successful until 1974, when <a href="Lin_Bolen" title="wikilink">Lin Bolen</a>, then NBC's Vice President of Daytime Programming, moved the show out of the noontime slot where it had been located for the majority of its run, as part of her effort to boost ratings among the 18&lt;U+2013&gt;34 female demographic. After 2,753 episodes, the original <em>Jeopardy!</em> series was ended on January 3, 1975; to compensate Griffin for its cancellation, NBC purchased <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, another show that he had created, and premiered it the following Monday. A syndicated edition distributed by <a href="Metromedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metromedia</a>, featuring many contestants who were previous champions on the original series, aired its episodes in the primetime during the 1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75 season. Even later, the NBC daytime series was revived as <em>The All-New Jeopardy!</em>, which premiered on October 2, 1978<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> and aired 108 episodes, ending on March 2, 1979;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> this revival featured significant rule changes, such as progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game, and a bonus round instead of Final Jeopardy!</p>
<p>The daily syndicated version debuted on September 10, 1984, and was launched in response to the success of the syndicated version of <em>Wheel</em> and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars. The daily syndicated <em>Jeopardy!</em> has met with greater success than the previous incarnations of the program; it has outlived 300 other game shows and become the second most popular game show in syndication, averaging 25 million viewers per week.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The show's most recent renewal, from October 2012, takes it through the 2015&lt;U+2013&gt;16 season.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Three spin-off programs of <em>Jeopardy!</em> have been created. <em>Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!</em>, which debuted on <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a> in 1998 and ran until 2001, centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by <a href="Jeff_Probst" title="wikilink">Jeff Probst</a>. <em>Jep!</em>, which aired on <a href="GSN" class="uri" title="wikilink">GSN</a> during the 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99 season, was a special children's version hosted by <a href="Bob_Bergen" title="wikilink">Bob Bergen</a> that featured various rule changes. <em>Sports Jeopardy!</em>, an exclusively online version hosted by <a href="Dan_Patrick" title="wikilink">Dan Patrick</a>, will debut in fall 2014 on the <a href="Crackle_(company)" title="wikilink">Crackle</a> digital service.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>Starting in 1985, the show has held an annual <a href="Jeopardy!_Tournament_of_Champions" title="wikilink">Tournament of Champions</a> featuring the top fifteen champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. Originally valued at $100,000, the top prize awarded to the winner was increased to $250,000 in 2003.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The tournament runs for ten consecutive episodes in a format devised by Trebek himself, which consists of five quarter-final games, three semifinals, and a final consisting of two games with the scores totaled.</p>

In the first two tournaments, the winner received $25,000, and for the third, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament is significant for being the first week of <em>Jeopardy!</em> episodes to be taped in a foreign country, because it was taped in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>, on the set of the Swedish version of <em>Jeopardy!</em></p>

<p>All Trebek-hosted episodes of <em>Jeopardy!</em> are completely intact, including both of the daily syndicated version's pilot episodes. GSN, which, like <em>Jeopardy!,</em> is an affiliate of SPT, has rerun ten seasons since the channel's launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated <em>Jeopardy!</em> episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and the premiere and various other episodes are included in the Paley Center's collection.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>There is a 67-game disparity between the show numbers assigned to first-run <em>Jeopardy!</em> episodes and the actual number of Trebek-era games played. To assist subscribing affiliate stations in airing episodes in the correct order, a show number is read by Gilbert just before the taping of each game. This number is audible on the episodes when they are received by the affiliates and is visible on the slate attached to them, which is trimmed from the show prior to broadcast. Each new episode receives an integer show number 1 greater than the previous episode; however, the 65 reruns in Season 1 (1984&lt;U+2013&gt;85) were given new show numbers despite not being new games, and a single game of the &quot;IBM Challenge&quot; was broadcast over two shows<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> (No. 6086, No. 6087).</p>

In a dream sequence, Dorothy competes against roommate Rose Nylund (<a href="Betty_White" title="wikilink">Betty White</a>) and neighbor Charlie Deitz (<a href="David_Leisure" title="wikilink">David Leisure</a>), in a crossover from <em><a href="Empty_Nest" title="wikilink">Empty Nest</a></em>.

<h3 id="internet">Internet</h3>
<p><em>Jeopardy!</em>{{'}}s official website, active as early as 1998,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> receives over 400,000 monthly visitors. The website features videos, photographs, and textual information related to the contestants for each new week, as well as minisites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments. As the show changes its main title card and corresponding graphics with every passing season, the <em>Jeopardy!</em> website is re-skinned to reflect each introduction of a new main title design, and the general content of the site (such as online tests and promotions, programming announcements, &quot;spotlight&quot; segments, photo galleries, and downloadable content) is regularly updated to align with producers' priorities for the show.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> In its 2012 &quot;Readers Choice Awards&quot;, Carrie Grosvenor of <a href="About.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">About.com</a> praised the official <em>Jeopardy!</em> website for featuring &quot;everything [visitors] need to know about the show, as well as some fun interactive elements&quot;, and for featuring &quot;one of the funniest error pages [she had] ever seen&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 2009, <em>Jeopardy!</em> launched a viewer loyalty program called the &quot;Jeopardy! Premier Club&quot;, which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly <em>Jeopardy!</em> game featuring categories and clues from the previous week's episodes. Every three months, players were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest scoring players would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of <em>Jeopardy!</em><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> The Premier Club was discontinued by July 2011.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>There is an unofficial <em>Jeopardy!</em> fansite known as the &quot;J! Archive&quot; (<a href="http://j-archive.com/">j-archive.com</a>), which transcribes games from throughout <em>Jeopardy!</em>{{'}}s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by <em>Jeopardy!</em>-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a &quot;wagering calculator&quot; that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called &quot;Coryat scoring&quot; that disregards wagering during Daily Doubles or Final Jeopardy! and gauges one's general strength at the game. The site's main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, a student from <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Ohio</a>,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> who himself appeared as a contestant on <em>Jeopardy!</em> episodes aired in March 2010.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Before J!
