<p>&quot;<strong>Born This Way</strong>&quot; is a song by American recording artist <a href="Lady_Gaga" title="wikilink">Lady Gaga</a>, from her second studio album, <em><a href="Born_This_Way" title="wikilink">Born This Way</a></em>. Written and produced by Gaga, <a href="Fernando_Garibay" title="wikilink">Fernando Garibay</a>, <a href="Jeppe_Laursen" title="wikilink">Jeppe Laursen</a> and DJ White Shadow, &quot;Born This Way&quot; was developed while Gaga was on the road with <a href="The_Monster_Ball_Tour" title="wikilink">The Monster Ball Tour</a>. Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the <a href="gay_community" title="wikilink">gay community</a>, Gaga explained that &quot;Born This Way&quot; was her freedom song. Previously, she had sung part of the <a href="refrain" title="wikilink">chorus</a> at the <a href="2010_MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">2010 MTV Video Music Awards</a> in 2010. The song was announced as the <a href="single_(music)" title="wikilink">lead single</a> from the album, and was released on February 11, 2011&lt;U+2014&gt;two days prior to its scheduled date&lt;U+2014&gt;along side the release of the full set of lyrics and the single artwork.</p>
<p>Musically &quot;Born This Way&quot; is an <a href="electropop" class="uri" title="wikilink">electropop</a> song, backed by rumbling synth sounds and a humming bass, with a <a href="percussion" class="uri" title="wikilink">percussion</a> added in the chorus. It also includes Gaga singing <a href="a_capella" title="wikilink">a capella</a> near the end with an <a href="organ_(music)" title="wikilink">organ</a> added. The lyrics of the song talk about self-empowerment and feature the names of LGBT communities like gay, lesbian and transgender, amongst others. The usage of the terms &quot;<a href="cholo" title="wikilink">chola</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="orient" class="uri" title="wikilink">orient</a>&quot; in the song drew criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, who claimed that the terms had been used in an offensive and derogatory manner. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Country Road version recorded by Gaga herself, and another by Indian music producer duo <a href="Salim-Sulaiman" title="wikilink">Salim and Sulaiman Merchant</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Born This Way&quot; received mixed reception from critics; it was complimented for being a &quot;club-ready anthem&quot;, while faced criticism for having similarities with <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>'s 1989 single &quot;<a href="Express_Yourself_(Madonna_song)" title="wikilink">Express Yourself</a>&quot;. Some reviewers surmised that the similarities would damage the song's appeal, others felt that &quot;Born This Way&quot; was nonetheless a completely separate piece of work. The song reached number one in 19 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Sweden. In the United States, it became her third single to top the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a> chart. Additionally, &quot;Born This Way&quot; became the 1000th number-one song on the Hot 100, spending a total of six weeks atop the chart. It became the fastest-selling song in <a href="iTunes" class="uri" title="wikilink">iTunes</a> history, selling one million copies in five days.</p>
<p>The accompanying <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a> for the song was directed by <a href="Nick_Knight_(photographer)" title="wikilink">Nick Knight</a> and Gaga herself. It was inspired by painters like <a href="Salvador_Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt;" title="wikilink">Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt;</a> and <a href="Francis_Bacon_(artist)" title="wikilink">Francis Bacon</a>, and their <a href="surrealism" title="wikilink">surrealistic</a> images. The main idea behind the video is Gaga giving birth to a new race, which is shown with the help of a prologue. After the song starts and a series of dance sequences later, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted the video for its cultural references and artistic similarities to the work of <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a>, Madonna and late fashion designer <a href="Alexander_McQueen" title="wikilink">Alexander McQueen</a>, as well as to <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a> and surrealism. &quot;Born This Way&quot; was first performed at the <a href="53rd_Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">53rd Grammy Awards</a>, where Gaga sang it after coming out of an incubating vessel. The song was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows like <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em> and <em><a href="Good_Morning_America" title="wikilink">Good Morning America</a></em>. Singers <a href="Katy_Perry" title="wikilink">Katy Perry</a> and <a href="Maria_Aragon" title="wikilink">Maria Aragon</a> have covered the song.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In 2010, <a href="Lady_Gaga" title="wikilink">Lady Gaga</a> was touring for her second world tour, <a href="The_Monster_Ball_Tour" title="wikilink">The Monster Ball</a>. At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album, <em><a href="Born_This_Way" title="wikilink">Born This Way</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself, described by Gaga as a &quot;magical message&quot; song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an <a href="Immaculate_Conception" title="wikilink">Immaculate Conception</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> One of the first people to listen to the track was Gaga's friend <a href="Perez_Hilton" title="wikilink">Perez Hilton</a>, who considered it to be a staple song for the gay community and felt it would be successful.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for coming up with the idea and the theme behind the song. &quot;We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think until you hear it,&quot; he added.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> her inspiration behind the song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; Harkening back to the early '90s, when <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>, <a href="En_Vogue" title="wikilink">En Vogue</a>, <a href="Whitney_Houston" title="wikilink">Whitney Houston</a> and <a href="TLC_(band)" title="wikilink">TLC</a> were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 43rd episode of her web video series, <em>Transmission Gagavision</em>, Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing &quot;Born This Way&quot; was how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident. &quot;'Born This Way' is who I am. An artist in a constant state of half-fantasy/half-reality at all times,&quot; she added.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The lyrics during the verses talk about empowerment, while the chorus talks about making no apologies and accept one as themselves.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> It features the names of <a href="gay_community" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> and other minor communities, which was due to the support that Gaga had received from the community over the years. She also explained that since <em><a href="The_Fame" title="wikilink">The Fame</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Fame_Monster" title="wikilink">The Fame Monster</a></em> did not directly address those communities, &quot;Born This Way&quot; was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs, but also empowered her to artistically say, &quot;'I'm not being safe with this record.' I'm not trying to gain new fans. I love the fans I already have, and this is for them.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>After the early release of the lyrics, it had garnered criticism from some Asian<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> claiming that the usage of the terms &quot;<a href="cholo" title="wikilink">chola</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Orient#Perceptions_and_connotations" title="wikilink">orient</a>&quot; was offensive and derogatory.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned the use of the term &quot;chola&quot;, asking, &quot;Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community?

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. <a href="Bernard_Herrmann" title="wikilink">Bernard Herrmann</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s prelude to the movie <em><a href="Vertigo_(film)" title="wikilink">Vertigo</a></em> plays<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> while Gaga declares, &quot;This is the manifesto of Mother Monster,&quot; and begins telling the prologue of the video&lt;U+2014&gt;a story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race which &quot;bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom.&quot; Gaga is shown sitting in the throne above a planet, with her <a href="Lithotomy_position" title="wikilink">legs spread apart</a>, giving birth to a &quot;new race within the race of humanity.&quot; As she continues, Gaga explains that the birth of the new race was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga is split in half while being pulled between the two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to an assault rifle and begins to fire it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, &quot;How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?&quot;</p>
<p>As the song begins, numerous people are shown on their hands and knees in a motionless, organized pattern, in a seemingly endless black space. Gaga appears in a black bra and underwear, with shoulder and facial protrusions. She begins walking in an eccentric manner among them with raised hand, before contently nodding her head and crouching on her hands and knees to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone raises their head and begins dancing to elaborate choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. As the second verse begins, Gaga and Rico are both shown wearing tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his full-body zombie tattoos. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among several oddly distorted mannequin heads.
