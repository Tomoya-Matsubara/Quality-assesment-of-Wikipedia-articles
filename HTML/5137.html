<p><strong>Portugal</strong>, officially the <strong>Portuguese Republic</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>; ), is a country in southwestern <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the <a href="Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberian Peninsula</a>. Being the westernmost country of mainland Europe, Portugal is bordered by the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the west and south and by <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> to the north and east. The Atlantic <a href="archipelago" title="wikilink">archipelagos</a> of the <a href="Azores_Islands" title="wikilink">Azores</a> and <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a> are also part of Portugal.</p>
<p>The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continously settled since <a href="Prehistoric_Iberia" title="wikilink">prehistoric times</a>. Some of the earliest <a href="civilization" title="wikilink">civilizations</a> include <a href="Lusitanians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lusitanians</a> and <a href="Celt" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> societies. Incorporation into the <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a> dominions took place in the 2nd century BC. The region was ruled and colonized by <a href="Germanic_peoples" title="wikilink">Germanic peoples</a>, such as the <a href="Suebi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suebi</a> and the <a href="Visigoths" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visigoths</a>, from the 5th to the 8th century. The <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> <a href="Moors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moors</a> arrived in the early 8th century and conquered the <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> <a href="Timeline_of_Portuguese_history_(Germanic_Kingdoms)" title="wikilink">Germanic kingdoms</a>, eventually occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 1100s, during the Christian <em><a href="Reconquista" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconquista</a></em>, Portugal appeared as a kingdom independent of its neighbour, the <a href="Kingdom_of_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Galicia" title="wikilink">Galicia</a>. In a little over a century, in 1249, Portugal would establish almost its entire modern-day borders by conquering territory from the Moors.</p>
<p>During the 15th and 16th centuries, with a <a href="Portuguese_Empire" title="wikilink">global empire</a> that included possessions in <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>, <a href="Asia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asia</a> and <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>, Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. In the 17th century, the <a href="Portuguese_Restoration_War" title="wikilink">Portuguese Restoration War</a> between Portugal and Spain ended the sixty year period of the <a href="Iberian_Union" title="wikilink">Iberian Union</a> (1580-1640). In the 19th century, armed conflict with French and Spanish invading forces and the loss of its largest territorial possession abroad, <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, disrupted political stability and potential economic growth. After the <a href="Portuguese_Colonial_War" title="wikilink">Portuguese Colonial War</a> and the <a href="Carnation_Revolution" title="wikilink">Carnation Revolution</a> <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a> in 1974, the ruling <a href="Estado_Novo_(Portugal)" title="wikilink">regime</a> was deposed in Lisbon and the country handed over its last overseas provinces in Africa. Portugal's last overseas territory, <a href="Macau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macau</a>, was handed over to the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">P. R. China</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>Portugal is a <a href="developed_country" title="wikilink">developed country</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and although having one of the lowest <a href="GDP_per_capita" title="wikilink">GDP per capita</a> of <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western European</a> countries, it has a high <a href="Human_Development_Index" title="wikilink">Human Development Index</a> and is among the world's 20 highest rated countries in terms of <a href="quality_of_life" title="wikilink">quality of life</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is a member of the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> (since 1986) and the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> (since 1955); as well as a founding member of <a href="OECD" class="uri" title="wikilink">OECD</a>, <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a>, <a href="CPLP" class="uri" title="wikilink">CPLP</a> (Comunidade dos Pa&lt;U+00ED&gt;ses de L&lt;U+00ED&gt;ngua Portuguesa &lt;U+2014&gt; Community of Portuguese Language Countries), and the European Union's <a href="Eurozone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurozone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The early history of Portugal, whose name derives from the Roman name <a href="Portus_Cale" title="wikilink">Portus Cale</a>, is shared with the rest of the <a href="Iberian_peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberian peninsula</a>. The region was <a href="Pre-Roman_peoples_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">settled</a> by Pre-<a href="Celts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celts</a> and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the <a href="Lusitanians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lusitanians</a>, visited by <a href="Phoenicians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenicians</a> and <a href="Carthaginians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthaginians</a>, incorporated in the <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a> dominions (as <a href="Lusitania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lusitania</a> in 138 BC), settled again by <a href="Suevi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suevi</a>, <a href="Buri_(Germanic_tribe)" title="wikilink">Buri</a>, and <a href="Visigoths" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visigoths</a>, and conquered by <a href="Moors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moors</a>. In 868, during the <a href="Reconquista" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconquista</a> (by which Christians reconquered the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim and Moorish domination), the <a href="First_County_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">First County of Portugal</a> was formed. A victory over the Muslims at <a href="Ourique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ourique</a> in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when Portugal is transformed from a county into an <a href="Portuguese_monarchy" title="wikilink">independent kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Portugal traces its national origin to <a href="June_24" title="wikilink">June 24</a> <a href="1128" class="uri" title="wikilink">1128</a> with the <a href="Battle_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Mamede" title="wikilink">Battle of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Mamede</a>. At the <a href="Battle_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Mamede" title="wikilink">Battle of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Mamede</a>, <a href="Afonso_I_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Afonso Henriques</a>, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother, <a href="Teresa,_Countess_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Countess Teresa</a>, and her lover, <a href="Fern&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Peres_de_Trava" title="wikilink">Fern&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Peres de Trava</a>, in battle - thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself <a href="List_of_Portuguese_monarchs" title="wikilink">king of Portugal</a> on <a href="July_25" title="wikilink">July 25</a>, <a href="1139" class="uri" title="wikilink">1139</a>, after the <a href="Battle_of_Ourique" title="wikilink">Battle of Ourique</a> and was recognized as such in 1143 by <a href="Alfonso_VII_of_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Afonso VII</a>, king of Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and Castile, and in 1179 by <a href="Pope_Alexander_III" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander III</a>.</p>
<p>Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military <a href="Christian_monasticism" title="wikilink">monastic orders</a>, pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, this <a href="Reconquista" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconquista</a> ended with the capture of the <a href="Algarve" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algarve</a> on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present day borders, with minor exceptions. <img src="Castelo_de_Guimar&lt;U+00E3&gt;es_(Portugal).jpg" title="fig:The 10th century Castle of Guimar&lt;U+00E3&gt;es, a national symbol, known as the &quot;Cradle of Portugal&quot;, Guimar&lt;U+00E3&gt;es" alt="The 10th century Castle of Guimar&lt;U+00E3&gt;es, a national symbol, known as the &quot;Cradle of Portugal&quot;, Guimar&lt;U+00E3&gt;es" /> In 1373, Portugal made an <a href="Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance" title="wikilink">alliance with England</a>, which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.</p>
<p>In 1383, the king of Castile, husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir, claimed his throne. An ensuing popular revolt led to the <a href="1383-1385_Crisis" title="wikilink">1383-1385 Crisis</a>. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later <a href="John_I_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">John I</a>), seconded by General <a href="Nuno_&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares_Pereira" title="wikilink">Nuno &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares Pereira</a> defeated the Castilians in the <a href="Battle_of_Aljubarrota" title="wikilink">Battle of Aljubarrota</a>. This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain.</p>
<p>In the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the <a href="Portugal_in_the_Age_of_Discovery" title="wikilink">Age of Discovery</a>. Prince <a href="Henry_the_Navigator" title="wikilink">Henry the Navigator</a>, son of King Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o I, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.</p>
<p>In 1415, Portugal gained the first of its overseas colonies when a fleet conquered <a href="Ceuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ceuta</a>, a prosperous Islamic trade center in North <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a> and the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a>, which led to the first <a href="colonialism" title="wikilink">colonization</a> movements. <img src="Portugal_Imp&lt;U+00E9&gt;rio_total.png" title="fig:An anachronous map of the Portuguese Empire (1415-1999).

In 1498, <a href="Vasco_da_Gama" title="wikilink">Vasco da Gama</a> finally reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its then population of one million residents.</p>
<p>In 1500, <a href="Pedro_&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares_Cabral" title="wikilink">Pedro &lt;U+00C1&gt;lvares Cabral</a>, en route to India, discovered <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> and claimed it for Portugal.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Ten years later, <a href="Afonso_de_Albuquerque" title="wikilink">Afonso de Albuquerque</a> conquered <a href="Goa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goa</a>, in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, <a href="Ormuz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ormuz</a> in the Persian Strait, and <a href="Malacca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malacca</a> in what is now a <a href="state" class="uri" title="wikilink">state</a> in <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> and South Atlantic. The Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places like <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, the island of <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a>, and it may also have been Portuguese sailors that were the first Europeans to discover <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Portugal's independence was interrupted between 1580 and 1640. Because the heirless King <a href="Sebasti&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Sebastian</a> died in battle in Morocco, <a href="Philip_II_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Philip II of Spain</a> claimed his throne and so became Philip I of Portugal. Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence, it was governed by the same monarch who governed <a href="Spanish_Empire" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, briefly forming a <a href="Iberian_Union" title="wikilink">union</a> of kingdoms, as a <a href="personal_union" title="wikilink">personal union</a>; in 1640, <a href="John_IV_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">John IV</a> spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The <a href="Portuguese_Restoration_War" title="wikilink">Portuguese Restoration War</a> between Portugal and Spain on the aftermath of the 1640 revolt, ended the sixty-year period of the <a href="Iberian_Union" title="wikilink">Iberian Union</a> under the <a href="House_of_Habsburg" title="wikilink">House of Habsburg</a>. This was the beginning of the <a href="House_of_Braganza" title="wikilink">House of Braganza</a>, which was to reign in Portugal until 1910. On <a href="1_November" title="wikilink">1 November</a> <a href="1755" class="uri" title="wikilink">1755</a>, <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, the largest city and capital of the Portuguese Empire, was strongly shaken by <a href="1755_Lisbon_earthquake" title="wikilink">an earthquake</a> which killed between 60,000 and 90,000 people and destroyed eighty-five percent of the city.</p>
<p>By this time, however, the <a href="Portuguese_empire" title="wikilink">Portuguese empire</a> was already under attack from other countries, specifically Britain and the Netherlands. Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>. <img src="Portuguese_colonial_war_map1.PNG" title="fig:Map of the Portuguese Overseas provinces in Africa by the time of the Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974)" alt="Map of the Portuguese Overseas provinces in Africa by the time of the Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974)" /> At the height of European <a href="colonialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonialism</a> in the 19th century, Portugal had lost its territory in <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a> and all but a few bases in Asia. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there. Portuguese territories eventually included the modern nations of <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a>, <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Tom&lt;U+00E9&gt;_and_Pr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ncipe" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Tom&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Pr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ncipe</a>, <a href="Guinea-Bissau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guinea-Bissau</a>, <a href="Angola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angola</a>, and <a href="Mozambique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozambique</a>.</p>
<p>In 1910, a revolution deposed the <a href="Portuguese_monarchs" title="wikilink">Portuguese monarchy</a>, but chaos continued and considerable economic problems were aggravated by the <a href="Portugal_in_the_Great_War" title="wikilink">military intervention in the First World War</a>, which led to a <a href="28_May_1926_coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">military coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat in 1926</a>. This in turn led to the establishment of a right-wing dictatorship by <a href="Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar" title="wikilink">Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Oliveira Salazar</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony of <a href="Portuguese_India" title="wikilink">Portuguese India</a> against an <a href="Operation_Vijay_(1961)" title="wikilink">Indian invasion</a>. The operations resulted in the defeat of the isolated and relatively small Portuguese defense force which was not able to resist a much larger enemy. The outcome was the loss of the Portuguese territories in the <a href="Indian_subcontinent" title="wikilink">Indian subcontinent</a>.</p>
<p>Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of <a href="Angola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angola</a>, <a href="Mozambique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mozambique</a>, and <a href="Portuguese_Guinea" title="wikilink">Portuguese Guinea</a>, in Africa, resulted in the <a href="Portuguese_Colonial_War" title="wikilink">Portuguese Colonial War</a> (1961-1974). In 1974, a bloodless left-wing military <a href="coup" class="uri" title="wikilink">coup</a> in <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, known as the <a href="Carnation_Revolution" title="wikilink">Carnation Revolution</a>, led the way for a modern democracy as well as the independence of the last colonies in Africa shortly after. However, Portugal's last overseas territory, <a href="Macau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macau</a> (Asia), was handed over to the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>Portugal was a founding member of <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a>, <a href="OECD" class="uri" title="wikilink">OECD</a> and <a href="EFTA" class="uri" title="wikilink">EFTA</a>. In 1986, Portugal joined the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> (then the <a href="European_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">European Economic Community</a>). It is also a co-founder of the <a href="CPLP" class="uri" title="wikilink">CPLP</a>.</p>
<h2 id="government-and-politics">Government and politics</h2>
<p><img src="Assembleia_Republica_Portugal_3.JPG" title="fig:Assembly of the Republic, Lisbon" alt="Assembly of the Republic, Lisbon" />  Portugal is a democratic republic ruled by the <a href="Portuguese_Constitution_of_1976" title="wikilink">constitution of 1976</a> with <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, the nation's largest city, as its capital.

Portugal is part of the world's oldest active alliance through its <a href="Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance" title="wikilink">treaty with the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The only international dispute concerns the municipality of <a href="Olivenza" title="wikilink">Oliven&lt;U+00E7&gt;a</a>. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Oliven&lt;U+00E7&gt;a was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the <a href="War_of_the_Oranges" title="wikilink">War of the Oranges</a>. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the <a href="Congress_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">Treaty of Vienna</a>.

The military of Portugal serves primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and providing humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. Since the early 2000s, compulsory military service is no longer practised. The changes also turned the forces' focus towards professional military engagements. The age for voluntary recruitment is set at 18.

Municipalities are grouped for administrative purposes into superior units. For continental Portugal the municipalities are gathered in 18 Districts, while the Islands have a Regional Government directly above them. Thus, the largest unit of classification is the one established since 1976 into either <a href="mainland_Portugal" title="wikilink">mainland Portugal</a> (<em>Portugal Continental</em>) or the <a href="autonomous_regions_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">autonomous regions of Portugal</a> (<a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> and <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>).</p>

The <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a> and <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> Atlantic archipelagos have a narrower temperature range. Generally, spring and summer are sunny, whereas autumn and winter are rainy and windy. Extreme temperatures occur in Northeastern parts of the country in winter (where they may fall to -15 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) and Southeastern parts in summer (where they can soar up to 45 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C). Sea coastal areas are milder, temperatures varying between -2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C in the coldest winter mornings and 37 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C in the hottest summer afternoons.

<p>Portugal's economy is based on industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cork and wood products, beverages (wine), porcelain and earthenware, and glass and glassware. In addition, the country has increased its role in Europe's automotive sector and has a world-class mold-making industry. Services, particularly tourism, are playing an increasingly important role. Portugal's <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> (EU) funding will be cut by 10%, to 22.5 billion euros, during the 2007-2013 period. EU expansion into eastern Europe has erased Portugal's historic competitive advantage and relative low labor costs. The governments are working to change Portugal's <a href="economic_development" title="wikilink">economic development</a> model from one based on <a href="consumption" title="wikilink">public consumption</a> and <a href="public_investment" title="wikilink">public investment</a> to one focused on <a href="exports" class="uri" title="wikilink">exports</a>, <a href="investment" title="wikilink">private investment</a>, and development of the <a href="high-tech" class="uri" title="wikilink">high-tech</a> sector.</p>
<p>Portugal joined the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> in 1986 and started a process of modernization within the framework of a stable environment. It has achieved a healthy level of growth. Successive governments have implemented reforms and privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy. Portugal was one of the founding countries of the <a href="euro" class="uri" title="wikilink">euro</a> in 1999, and therefore is integrated into the <a href="Eurozone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurozone</a>. <img src="1_Euro_coin_Pt.gif" title="fig:Portuguese national side of a 1 euro coin.

Agriculture and Fishing (see <a href="Portugal_EEZ" title="wikilink">Portugal EEZ</a>) no longer represents the bulk of the economy, but <a href="Portuguese_wines" title="wikilink">Portuguese wines</a>, namely <a href="Port_Wine" title="wikilink">Port Wine</a> (named after the country's second largest city, <a href="Porto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Porto</a>) and <a href="Madeira_Wine" title="wikilink">Madeira Wine</a> (named after <a href="Madeira" title="wikilink">Madeira Island</a>), are exported worldwide. <a href="Tourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tourism</a> is also important, especially in mainland Portugal's southernmost region of the <a href="Algarve" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algarve</a> and in the Atlantic <a href="Madeira" title="wikilink">Madeira archipelago</a>. <img src="Funchal_Pico_da_Cruz.jpg" title="fig:Funchal, Madeira - tourism is an important economic activity in the Portuguese island of Madeira." alt="Funchal, Madeira - tourism is an important economic activity in the Portuguese island of Madeira." /></p>

<p>In 2006 the world's largest <a href="solar_energy" title="wikilink">solar power</a> plant began operating in the nation's sunny south while the world's first commercial <a href="wave_power" title="wikilink">wave power</a> farm opened in October 2006 in the <a href="Norte_region" title="wikilink">Norte region</a>. As of 2006, 55% of electricity production was from coal and fuel power plants. The other 40% was produced by <a href="hydroelectric" title="wikilink">hydroelectrics</a> and 5% by <a href="wind_energy" title="wikilink">wind energy</a>. The government is channeling $3.8 billion into developing <a href="renewable_energy" title="wikilink">renewable energy</a> sources over the next five years.</p>
<p>Portugal wants <a href="renewable_energy" title="wikilink">renewable energy</a> sources like solar, wind and wave power to account for nearly half of the electricity consumed in the country by 2010. &quot;This new goal will place Portugal in the frontline of renewable energy and make it, along with <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> and <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, one of the three nations that most invest in this sector&quot;, Prime Minister <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_S&lt;U+00F3&gt;crates" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; S&lt;U+00F3&gt;crates</a> said. <img src="Alqueva3.jpg" title="fig:Alqueva Dam, Alentejo - irrigation and hydroelectric power generation facility which created the largest artificial lake in Western Europe" alt="Alqueva Dam, Alentejo - irrigation and hydroelectric power generation facility which created the largest artificial lake in Western Europe" /> Transportation was seen as a priority in the 1990s, pushed by the growing use of automobiles and industrialization. The country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) network of roads, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of a 44 <a href="motorway" title="wikilink">motorways</a> system.</p>
<p>The two principal metropolitan areas have subway systems: <a href="Lisbon_Metro" title="wikilink">Lisbon Metro</a> and Metro Sul do Tejo in Lisbon <a href="Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Area</a> and <a href="Porto_Metro" title="wikilink">Porto Metro</a> in Porto, each with more than 35 km (22 mi) of lines.

<p>Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover point for many foreign airlines at airports all over the country. The government is currently studying two locations (<a href="Ota_Airport" title="wikilink">Ota</a> and Alcochete) to replace the present Lisbon airport. Currently, the most important airports are in <a href="Portela_Airport" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, <a href="Faro_Airport_(Portugal)" title="wikilink">Faro</a>, <a href="Francisco_S&lt;U+00E1&gt;_Carneiro_Airport" title="wikilink">Porto</a>, <a href="Madeira_Airport" title="wikilink">Funchal</a> (<a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>), and <a href="Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo_II_Airport" title="wikilink">Ponta Delgada</a> (<a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a>). <img src="A28_No_da_Povoa_de_Varzim.JPG" title="fig:A28 motorway, Norte - Portugal has a developed motorway system." alt="A28 motorway, Norte - Portugal has a developed motorway system." /> Portugal has one of the highest <a href="mobile_phone" title="wikilink">mobile phone</a> penetration rates in the <a href="world" class="uri" title="wikilink">world</a> (the number of operative mobile phones already exceeds the population). This network also provides wireless mobile Internet connections as well, and covers the entire territory. As of October 2006, 36.8% of households had high-speed Internet services and 78% of companies had Internet access. Most Portuguese watch television through cable (June 2004: 73.6% of households). Paid Internet connections are available at many caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, as well as many post offices. One can also surf on the Internet at hotels, conference centres and shopping centres, where special areas are reserved for this purpose. Free internet access is also available to Portuguese residents at &quot;Espa&lt;U+00E7&gt;os de Internet&quot; across the country.</p>
<p>Portugal has also modernized its <a href="Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Portugal" title="wikilink">water supply and sanitation system</a>, in particular by increasing the rate of wastewater treated with support from EU subsidies to 80%. The country has also established a modern institutional and legal framework for the water and sanitation sector, including an autonomous regulatory agency, a national asset holding company called Aguas de Portugal and a number of multi-municipal utilities. This replaced an institutionally fragemented sector structure, under which the country's 308 municipalities - many of them very small - had exclusive responsibility for water and sanitation.</p>

<h2 id="law">Law</h2>

<p>The <a href="Portuguese_legal_system" title="wikilink">Portuguese legal system</a> is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. Until the end of the 19th century, <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> law was the main influence. Since then the major influence has been <a href="German_legal_system" title="wikilink">German law</a>. The main laws include the <a href="Constitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constitution</a> (1976, as amended), the <a href="Civil_Code" title="wikilink">Civil Code</a> (1966, as amended) and the <a href="Penal_Code" title="wikilink">Penal Code</a> (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the <em>Commercial Code</em> (1888, as amended) and the <em>Civil Procedure Code</em> (1961, as amended). Portuguese law applied in the former <a href="Portuguese_colonies" title="wikilink">colonies and territories</a> and continues to be the major influence for those countries.</p>

A larger number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> origin or connotation. Although relations between the Portuguese state and the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the <a href="History_of_Portugal_(1279-1415)" title="wikilink">13th and 14th centuries</a>, the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the <a href="reconquista" title="wikilink">reconquest</a> and its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including the <a href="University_of_Coimbra" title="wikilink">first university</a>.
