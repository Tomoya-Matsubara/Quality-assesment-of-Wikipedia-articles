<p>The <strong>Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway</strong> was a major part of the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> system, extending the PRR west from <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> via <a href="Fort_Wayne,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne, Indiana</a> to <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>. It included the current <a href="Norfolk_Southern_Railway" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern</a>-owned <a href="Fort_Wayne_Line" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne Line</a> east of <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline, Ohio</a> to Pittsburgh, and the <a href="Fort_Wayne_Secondary" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne Secondary</a>, owned by <a href="CSX_Transportation" title="wikilink">CSX</a>, from Crestline west to Tolleston in <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gary, Indiana</a>. CSX leased its entire portion in 2004 to the <a href="Chicago,_Fort_Wayne_and_Eastern_Railroad" title="wikilink">Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad</a> (CFE). The remaining portion of the line from Tolleston into Chicago is now part of the Norfolk Southern's Chicago District, with a small portion of the original PFW&amp;C trackage abandoned in favor of the parallel lines of former competitors which are now part of the modern NS system.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad</strong> was chartered in <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> on February 24 and in <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> on April 11, 1848 to build from <a href="Allegheny,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Allegheny City</a> (annexed by <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> in 1907) west to <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline, Ohio</a> on the <a href="Cleveland,_Columbus_and_Cincinnati_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad</a>. It was organized on June 15, and construction began on July 4, 1849. The first section, from Allegheny City west to <a href="New_Brighton,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">New Brighton</a>, opened July 30, 1851. Extensions opened to <a href="Clarks_Summit,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Clarks Summit</a> on October 22 and <a href="Enon_Valley,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Enon Valley</a> November 19. On November 27, 1851 a section between <a href="Salem,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Salem</a> and <a href="Alliance,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Alliance, Ohio</a> was completed, not yet connected to the rest. On December 8, the east section was extended west to <a href="East_Palestine,_Ohio" title="wikilink">East Palestine, Ohio</a>, with a <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> transfer provided for through travel. Further sections opened January 3, 1852 west to <a href="Columbiana,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Columbiana</a>, and on January 6 the gap between Columbiana and Salem was filled. In conjunction with the <a href="Cleveland_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad</a>, connecting at Alliance, a through line was provided between <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> and Pittsburgh. On March 11, 1852, an extension west to <a href="Massillon,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Massillon</a> was opened with an excursion. On August 10, 1852 a further extension from Massillon west to <a href="Wooster,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Wooster</a> opened. The line west to <a href="Mansfield,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Mansfield</a> was finished April 8, 1853, and the full line to <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline</a> opened April 11. With this it formed part of a through line to <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati</a> via the <a href="Cleveland,_Columbus_and_Cincinnati_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad</a>.</p>
<p><img src="1850_Ohio_&amp;_Pennsylvania.jpg" title="fig:1850 map of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad" alt="1850 map of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad" width="299" /> Work began on August 16, 1854 on the <a href="Fort_Wayne_Railroad_Bridge" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge</a> over the <a href="Allegheny_River" title="wikilink">Allegheny River</a> to extend the O&amp;P into <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> to connect with the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>. The bridge opened September 22, 1857, with a temporary station at <a href="Penn_Street_(Pittsburgh)" title="wikilink">Penn Street</a> and <a href="Tenth_Street_(Pittsburgh)" title="wikilink">Tenth Street</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ohio and Indiana Railroad</strong> was chartered in <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> on March 26, 1850 and in <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> on January 15, 1851, to extend the line west to <a href="Fort_Wayne,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>. It was organized July 4, 1850 and work began in February 1852. Some of the capital was gained from a merger with the <strong>Great Western Railroad</strong> of Ohio in 1851. On August 26, 1853 the line opened from <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline</a> west to <a href="Bucyrus,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Bucyrus</a>, and a continuation west to <a href="Forest,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Forest</a> opened in early January 1854. On June 10 the line opened west to <a href="Delphos,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Delphos</a>, and on October 31 the full line to Fort Wayne was completed, opening the next day.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad</strong> was chartered in <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> on May 11, 1852 and organized September 14, 1852 as a further extension west to <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>. It was chartered February 5, 1853 in <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>. The first section opened in February 1856 from Fort Wayne to <a href="Columbia_City_(IN)" title="wikilink">Columbia City</a>.</p>
<p>On July 26, 1856 the <strong>Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Rail Road</strong> was formed as a consolidation of the Fort Wayne and Chicago, Ohio and Indiana, and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroads. Extensions opened west to <a href="Warsaw,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Warsaw</a> September 28, <a href="Plymouth,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> November 10, <a href="Englewood,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Englewood, Illinois</a> (south of <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>) on November 29, 1858, and Van Buren Street in Chicago on December 25, 1858. On January 1, 1859 trains started running to Chicago, with a terminal at the future location of <a href="Union_Station_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Union Station</a>. The part west of Plymouth was built with rails removed from the <a href="New_Portage_Railroad" title="wikilink">New Portage Railroad</a>.</p>
<p>From the early days, the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> (PRR) had been involved with the project, supplying funds. Once the <a href="Fort_Wayne_Railroad_Bridge" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge</a> at <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> was finished in 1857, trains began to run through from <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. In 1858 the PFW&amp;C began using the first <a href="Union_Station_(Pittsburgh)" title="wikilink">Union Station</a> in Pittsburgh, shared with the PRR.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1859 the PFW&amp;C defaulted on its debts, and was sold at <a href="foreclosure" class="uri" title="wikilink">foreclosure</a> on October 24, 1861. It was reorganized as the <strong>Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway</strong> February 26, 1862.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1865 the PFW&amp;C leased the <a href="New_Castle_and_Beaver_Valley_Railroad" title="wikilink">New Castle and Beaver Valley Railroad</a>, giving it a branch from <a href="Homewood,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Homewood, Pennsylvania</a> north to <a href="New_Castle,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">New Castle</a>. The <a href="Lawrence_Railroad" title="wikilink">Lawrence Railroad</a>, branching west from <a href="Lawrence_Junction" title="wikilink">Lawrence Junction</a> on the NC&amp;BV to <a href="Youngstown,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Youngstown, Ohio</a>, was leased on June 27, 1869. On June 1, 1887 the Lawrence Railroad became part of the <a href="Youngstown,_Lawrence_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad" title="wikilink">Youngstown, Lawrence and Pittsburgh Railroad</a>, which on August 1 merged into the PRR's <a href="Pittsburgh,_Youngstown_and_Ashtabula_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railroad</a>, and on January 9, 1906 that merged with the New Castle and Beaver Valley to form the <a href="Pittsburgh,_Youngstown_and_Ashtabula_Railway" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railway</a>, still leased to the PRR.</p>
<p>The PFW&amp;C bought the <a href="Cleveland,_Zanesville_and_Cincinnati_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad</a> by <a href="deed" class="uri" title="wikilink">deed</a> on July 1, 1865, making it its Akron Branch. The line ran from <a href="Hudson,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Hudson, Ohio</a> on the <a href="Cleveland_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad</a> south through <a href="Akron,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Akron</a>, crossing the PFW&amp;C at <a href="Orrville,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Orrville</a> and continuing to <a href="Millersburg,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Millersburg</a>. In 1868 a short 3.5 mile (5.5 km) extension to the south was built, and on November 4, 1869 the PFW&amp;C sold the line to the <a href="Pittsburgh,_Mt._Vernon,_Columbus_and_London_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh, Mt. Vernon, Columbus and London Railroad</a>. That company later became part of the PRR's <a href="Cleveland,_Akron_and_Cincinnati_Railway" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway</a>.</p>
<p>On May 22, 1869 the PFW&amp;C leased the <a href="Massillon_and_Cleveland_Railroad" title="wikilink">Massillon and Cleveland Railroad</a>, giving it a short branch from <a href="Massillon,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Massillon</a> north to the Akron Branch at <a href="Clinton,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Clinton</a>.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1869 the PRR leased the PFW&amp;C and began operating it directly, but on April 1, 1871 the PFW&amp;C was transferred to the newly-formed <a href="Pennsylvania_Company" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Company</a>. On December 1, 1871 the Pennsylvania Company leased the <a href="Cleveland_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad" title="wikilink">Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad</a>. Since January 25, 1860 the C&amp;P had been operated jointly by itself and by the PFW&amp;C, providing a branch of the PFW&amp;C from <a href="Rochester,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Rochester, Pennsylvania</a> west and north, crossing the PFW&amp;C at <a href="Alliance,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Alliance, Ohio</a> and continuing to <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>.</p>
<p>Operation was transferred back to the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> from the <a href="Pennsylvania_Company" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Company</a> on January 1, 1918.</p>
<p><img src="1874_PRR.jpg" title="fig:ca. 1874 Pennsylvania Railroad map, including the PFW&amp;C" alt="ca. 1874 Pennsylvania Railroad map, including the PFW&amp;C" width="299" /> On February 1, 1968 the PRR was merged into <a href="Penn_Central" title="wikilink">Penn Central</a>. The PFW&amp;C stayed separate, filing for <a href="bankruptcy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bankruptcy</a> on July 14, 1973 over three years after Penn Central's 1970 bankruptcy. On April 1, 1976 the PFW&amp;C became part of <a href="Conrail" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conrail</a>. Conrail downgraded the line, preferring other parallel lines. On June 2, 1994 the <a href="Norfolk_Southern_Railway" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> bought 18 miles (29 km) from <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gary</a> to <a href="Valparaiso,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Valparaiso</a>, which had been out of service since 1991, for $1.4 million. They soon bought 61 more miles (98 km), from Valparaiso east to <a href="Warsaw,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Warsaw</a>, and acquired <a href="trackage_rights" title="wikilink">trackage rights</a> east to <a href="Fort_Wayne,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne</a>.</p>
<p>With the August 22, 1998 breakup of Conrail, the line was split at <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline, Ohio</a>. West of Crestline, including the section that had been owned by Norfolk Southern since 1994, went to <a href="CSX_Transportation" title="wikilink">CSX Transportation</a>, along with the intersecting <a href="Cleveland,_Cincinnati,_Chicago_and_St._Louis_Railway" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway</a> (better known as the <strong>Big Four</strong>, a part of the <a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a> system until 1968). Tracks east of Crestline went to Norfolk Southern, which also obtained <a href="trackage_rights" title="wikilink">trackage rights</a> west of that Ohio city.</p>
<p>At the western end of the route, the original PFW&amp;C line has been abandoned from Buffington (an area of far northwestern <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gary, Indiana</a>, abutting <a href="East_Chicago,_Indiana" title="wikilink">East Chicago</a>) northwest for a little over four miles to <a href="Whiting,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Whiting, Indiana</a>; at both of these locations there are connections to the parallel tracks of the old <a href="Lake_Shore_and_Michigan_Southern_Railway" title="wikilink">Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway</a> (<a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a>). Northwest of Whiting, the LS&amp;MS itself disappears, and the present-day line goes back to using the old PFW&amp;C tracks, which run the rest of the way into <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, carrying both Norfolk Southern freight trains and several <a href="Amtrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a> passenger services.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2004 the <a href="Chicago_Fort_Wayne_and_Eastern_Railroad" title="wikilink">Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad</a>, a new <a href="Short-line_railroad" title="wikilink">short line</a> owned by <a href="RailAmerica" class="uri" title="wikilink">RailAmerica</a>, leased the western part of the line, from <a href="Crestline,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Crestline, Ohio</a> west to <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">the Gary, Indiana neighborhood of Tolleston</a>, from CSX. It also obtained <a href="overhead_trackage_rights" title="wikilink">overhead trackage rights</a> along the formerly out-of-service line from Tolleston, at the junction with the old <a href="Michigan_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">Michigan Central Railroad</a> (now CSX), northwest to Clarke Junction (also in Gary, just north of the <a href="Gary-Chicago_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Gary-Chicago International Airport</a>), and then west along the former <a href="Baltimore_and_Ohio_Chicago_Terminal_Railroad" title="wikilink">Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad</a> (now CSX) to <a href="Blue_Island,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Blue Island, Illinois</a>. <a href="Norfolk_Southern" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern</a> continues to own the line east of Crestline, OH as well as the part west of Whiting, IN.</p>
