<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Fire Brigade's original premises were located in the undercroft area of the <a href="Perth_Town_Hall" title="wikilink">Perth Town Hall</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, for which they paid a nominal rent. In 1899 the Fire Brigades Board proposed that land be bought in the proximity of the Town Hall and a new Fire Station be built. In October 1899 it was reported that the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="Matthew_Gibney" title="wikilink">Bishop Gibney</a> had offered some land at the intersection of <a href="Murray_Street,_Perth" title="wikilink">Murray</a> and Irwin Streets, which was then purchased for &lt;U+20A4&gt;3,125.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A list of architects was then submitted to the Board which on October 26, 1899 selected Michael Cavanagh, with the stipulation that the building he design not exceed &lt;U+20A4&gt;4,000. Michael Cavanagh, was an <a href="architect" class="uri" title="wikilink">architect</a> who came from <a href="Adelaide,_South_Australia" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a> to Perth in 1895, attracted by the gold boom prosperity in Western Australia, forming his own architectural firm, Cavanagh &amp; Cavanagh, with his brother James. Cavanagh also designed the Great Western Hotel (Brass Monkey Hotel), alterations to <a href="St_Mary&#39;s_Cathedral,_Perth" title="wikilink">St Mary's Cathedral</a>, <a href="Mt_Hawthorn,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Mt Hawthorn</a> Hotel (Paddington Ale House), Fremantle Fire Station (1908), St Patrick's Basilica (<a href="Fremantle,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Fremantle</a>), Sisters of Mercy Convent (<a href="Bunbury,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Bunbury</a>) and remodelled the Archbishop's Palace. In the early 1900s Cavanagh was a member of the <a href="City_of_Perth" title="wikilink">Perth City Council</a> and a member of the Perth Fire Brigade Board. The building was completed in December 1900 and the Fire Brigade moved into their new premises on January 1, 1901.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1910, the Fire Brigade was finding it necessary to expand and decided that the No 1 Fire Station would have to be extended in order to accommodate extra plant, extra workshop accommodation, Boardroom and Officers` Quarters. The block adjacent to the Fire Station in Irwin Street was purchased from the Roman Catholic Church and the Board at a cost of &lt;U+20A4&gt;2,100 pounds.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This block of land had a school building on it, so the building committee recommended that the Fire Brigade Staff (many of whom were skilled tradesmen) &quot;...undertake the building of the workshops and lecture room with the old material available in the School&quot;. James (Jack) Learmonth Ochiltree was appointed as the architect for the additions (Ochiltree's firm, Ochiltree &amp; Hargrave, went on to design a number of Inter-War <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> buildings in Perth). The additions to the building, consisting of new boardroom, offices, apparatus room, ambulance shed, store and chief officers` quarters, and was completed in 1914.</p>
<h2 id="current-use">Current Use</h2>
<p>In 1979, the Perth Fire Brigade vacated the building, which was subsequently restored between 1983 and 1985. The external work involved re-roofing with terracotta tiles to match existing, reconstruction of a limestone arch which had been replaced with a concrete lintel to suit larger and higher engines and replacement of columns, mouldings and original doors which had been removed. Internal work included new timber stairs, toilets and a theatrette. New ceiling cornices and ceiling roses were installed to match the period and the existing.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The building was reopened in 1985 as the Fire Safety Education Centre and Museum.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 2006 further refurbishment works were undertaken to address access by people with disabilities to the buildings and facilities.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
