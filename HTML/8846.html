<p>Criser's term as president is remembered for the enhancement of the university's instructional quality, the rapid rise of its admission standards, the growth of its academic reputation, and its successful fund-raising among alumni and the business community.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> His administration successfully completed the process of the University of Florida's admission to the <a href="Association_of_American_Universities" title="wikilink">Association of American Universities</a> (AAU), the leading association of North American research universities, in 1985,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and forthrightly handled the football program's widespread violations of <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) rules under coach <a href="Charley_Pell" title="wikilink">Charley Pell</a> that shocked the university community during the 1984&lt;U+2013&gt;1985 academic year.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Criser was responsible for initiating the university's first comprehensive capital campaign in the fall of 1988.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> When completed three years later, in 1991, the capital campaign had raised more than $390 million dollars for the university's <a href="financial_endowment" title="wikilink">endowment</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> At the time, the capital campaign was the third-highest fund-raising campaign ever conducted by a state university.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Criser advocated reducing class sizes to improve the quality of academic instruction, and proposed reducing the undergraduate student body by 1,500 students while maintaining the university faculty and budget.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The next three <a href="freshman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freshman</a> classes were to be reduced by 500 entering students each.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He also made plans for raising the university's admissions standards and its upper division retention requirements, bolstering the academic counseling program, and rewarding faculty excellence in instruction, research and academic publishing.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The lost income from the smaller entering classes, and the costs of the other academic enhancements, were to be offset by increased investment income resulting from the capital campaign's additions to the university endowment.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
