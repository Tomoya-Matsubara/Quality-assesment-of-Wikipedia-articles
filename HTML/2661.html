<p><em><a href="Don_(honorific)" title="wikilink">Dona</a></em> <strong>Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia</strong> (1 December 1831 &lt;U+2013&gt; 4 February 1853) was a princess of the <a href="Empire_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Empire of Brazil</a>. Her parents were Emperor <a href="Dom_(title)" title="wikilink">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro_I_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Pedro I</a> and <a href="Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie_of_Leuchtenberg" title="wikilink">Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie of Leuchtenberg</a>. She was a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House_of_Braganza" title="wikilink">House of Braganza</a> (Portuguese: <em>Bragan&lt;U+00E7&gt;a</em>). The only child of her father's second marriage, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was born in France after Pedro I abdicated the Brazilian throne. Before Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was a month old, Pedro I went to Portugal to restore the crown of his eldest daughter, <a href="Maria_II_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Maria II</a>. He fought a successful war against his brother <a href="Miguel_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Miguel</a>, who had usurped Maria II's throne.</p>
<p>Pedro I unexpectedly died from <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> while still in Portugal, only months after his victory. Not yet three and fatherless, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia settled in Portugal with her mother, Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie. Brazil's government refused for many years to acknowledge the princess as a member of Brazil's Imperial House because she was foreign-born. Her elder half-brother <a href="Pedro_II_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Pedro II</a> had succeeded Pedro I as emperor, but was only a child and unable to intervene on her behalf. She was not officially recognized as a Brazilian princess until after Pedro II was declared of age in 1840, and she would never travel to Brazil during her lifetime. The princess grew into an attractive and intelligent woman who was well-educated, and accomplished at drawing, painting, and the piano.</p>
<p>In early 1852, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was engaged to Archduke <a href="Maximilian_I_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Maximilian</a> of <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>. The couple fell deeply in love, but the marriage never occurred due to her premature death. She fell ill with tuberculosis and was taken to the town of <a href="Funchal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funchal</a> on the Portuguese island of <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>, where it was hoped that the princess would recover. Her health continued to deteriorate, however, and Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia died on 4 February 1853. Her body was brought to mainland Portugal and interred in the <a href="Monastery_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Vicente_de_Fora#Braganza_Pantheon" title="wikilink">Braganza Pantheon</a>. Almost 130 years later, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's remains were carried to Brazil. In Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's honor, her mother financed the construction of a hospital in Funchal called &quot;<em>Princesa D. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia</em>&quot;. Maximilian eventually married, and afterwards made a personal pilgrimage to Brazil and other places linked to the princess. The trip influenced his eventual acceptance of the throne of <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> in 1864.</p>

<h3 id="birth">Birth</h3>
<p><img src="Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie_of_Leuchtenberg_1840.jpg" title="fig:Princess Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia around age 9 with her mother, c.1840" alt="Princess Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia around age 9 with her mother, c.1840" width="200" /> Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was born on 1 December 1831 in Paris, France. She was <a href="Infant_baptism" title="wikilink">christened</a> Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia Augusta Eug&lt;U+00EA&gt;nia Josefina Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa Teodolinda El&lt;U+00F3&gt;i Francisco Xavier de Paula Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga.</p>
<p>She was the only daughter of Dom Pedro, the Duke of Braganza, and his second wife <a href="Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie_of_Leuchtenberg" title="wikilink">Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie of Leuchtenberg</a> (known in Brazil as <em>Dona</em> Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia). Pedro had formerly been the first Emperor of Brazil, as Pedro I, and had then become King of Portugal, reigning as Pedro IV. His eldest daughter, <a href="Maria_II_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Maria II</a>, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's half-sister, was the child of Pedro's first marriage to Archduchess <a href="Maria_Leopoldina_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Maria Leopoldina of Austria</a>. In 1826, Pedro had abdicated the Portuguese throne, and Maria II had succeeded him, becoming Queen of Portugal. Two years later, her position was usurped by her uncle (Pedro's younger brother) Dom <a href="Miguel_I_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Miguel I</a>. Eager to restore Maria II, Pedro abdicated the Brazilian throne in April 1831 and departed for Europe with his wife, who was pregnant with Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia.</p>
<p>Through her father, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House_of_Braganza" title="wikilink">House of Braganza</a>, and was referred to by the honorific &quot;<em>Dona</em>&quot; from birth. She was the granddaughter of the Portuguese King <a href="John_VI_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o VI</a> and his wife <a href="Carlota_Joaquina" title="wikilink">Carlota Joaquina</a>. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's mother was the daughter of <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_de_Beauharnais" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne de Beauharnais</a>, Duke of Leuchtenberg and the stepson of Emperor <a href="Napoleon_I" title="wikilink">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> of France. Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne was married to Princess <a href="Augusta_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Augusta</a>, eldest daughter of King <a href="Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Maximilian I</a> of Bavaria.</p>
<p>To acknowledge Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's rights as a Brazilian princess, Pedro invited several guests to observe her birth. Among these was Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim da Rocha, one of the leading figures during <a href="Brazilian_independence" title="wikilink">Brazil's independence</a>, who was then serving as the Brazilian diplomatic envoy to France. The newborn's <a href="godparent" title="wikilink">godparents</a> were the French King <a href="Louis_Philippe&amp;nbsp;I" title="wikilink">Louis Philippe&amp;nbsp;I</a> and his consort, <a href="Maria_Amalia_of_Naples_and_Sicily" title="wikilink">Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily</a>. Pedro was delighted with his new baby, and sent a letter dated &quot;4 December&quot; to his children who had remained in Brazil&lt;U+2014&gt;including the child-emperor Dom <a href="Pedro_II_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Pedro II</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;with the message: &quot;Divine Providence wanted to lessen the sorrow that my paternal heart feels in the separation from Y.I.M. [Your Imperial Majesty], giving me one more Daughter, and to Y.I.M., one more sister and subject ...&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="Drawing_by_maria_amelia.jpg" title="fig:A drawing made by Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia" alt="A drawing made by Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia" width="250" /> When Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia was only 20 days old, her father departed to invade Portugal at the head of an army. For almost two years, she lived in Paris with her mother and half-sister Maria II. When news arrived that the Portuguese capital, <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a>, had fallen to Pedro's forces, Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie of Leuchtenberg departed Paris with her infant daughter, and her stepdaughter, for Portugal. They arrived in Lisbon on 22 September 1833 and disembarked the next day. <a href="Charles_John_Napier" title="wikilink">Charles John Napier</a>, a British naval officer who had fought alongside Pedro, wrote about the emotional reunion: &quot;I never saw [Pedro] so happy and pleased; he went onboard just a little above <a href="Santa_Maria_de_Bel&lt;U+00E9&gt;m" title="wikilink">Bel&lt;U+00E9&gt;m</a>; he was received at the ladder by the empress [Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie] who hugged and kissed him with the greatest affection: the queen [Maria II] was very moved and could not hold her tears. The little Princess [Maria] Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia, his youngest daughter, took much of his attention: she became somewhat scared of seeing his bushy beard and did not correspond much to his caresses.&quot;</p>
<p>With Miguel defeated and exiled from Portugal, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia and her family settled in Portugal. They first resided in the Palace of Ramalh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, and later, in the <a href="Queluz_National_Palace" title="wikilink">Royal Palace of Queluz</a> near Lisbon. However, the conflict had taken its toll on her father's health, and he was dying of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>. Pedro had established a very close relationship with his daughter, and they adored each other. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, he raised his hands to bless her and said: &quot;Always tell this child of the father who loved her so dearly ... not to forget me ... always to obey her mother ... those are my last wishes ...&quot; In the early afternoon of the same day, Pedro died.</p>
<p>Widowed, Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie would never remarry and her days were spent overseeing her daughter's upbringing. Both permanently settled in Portugal, although they were not members of the Portuguese Royal Family. Neither of them ever traveled to Brazil, although Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie unsuccessfully petitioned the Brazilian government to recognize mother and daughter as part of Brazil's Imperial Family and entitled to an income. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's half-brother, Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, was a minor, and the government was in the hands of a precarious <a href="Regent" title="wikilink">regency</a>. The courtiers and politicians who dominated the government feared rival centers of influence. They also suspected that Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie might join with other political factions to undercut their own power. The government refused, for many years, to acknowledge Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia as a Brazilian princess due to her foreign birth, and forbade both her and her mother from setting foot in Brazil. The situation would only change after Pedro II was declared of age in 1840 and was in a position to insist that they be recognized as members of his household. Aureliano Coutinho, the Viscount of Sepetiba, and Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, requested the parliament to grant them recognition, which occurred on 5 July 1841.</p>

<h3 id="ill-fated-engagement">Ill-fated engagement</h3>
<p><img src="August_Schoefft_002.png" title="fig:Archduke Maximilian became Emperor of Mexico in 1864, but was executed three years later." alt="Archduke Maximilian became Emperor of Mexico in 1864, but was executed three years later." width="200" /> Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia grew into an attractive young woman. Described as very kind, religious and intelligent, the princess received a refined education. She was highly skilled in drawing, painting and playing the piano. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia also loved poetry. She spoke Portuguese, French and German fluently. A teacher said of her that she &quot;has, without knowing, an exceptional talent for <a href="dialectic" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialectic</a>, an ability that would make the fortune of a young law student.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the main forces that apparently motivated Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's dedication to her education was her father. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: &quot;and my father, who looks at me from heaven, shall he be pleased with his daughter?&quot; She was never quite able to cope with her father's death and it deeply touched her. A letter written by the princess on 27 August 1851 tells about her feelings:</p>

<p>In early 1852, Austrian Archduke <a href="Maximilian_I_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Maximilian</a>, then serving in the Austrian navy and on a stopover in Portugal, visited Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie and Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia. The princess had already met him at a family reunion in <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a> in 1838. Maximilian's mother was the younger half-sister of Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's maternal grandmother, and both women were members of the German <a href="House_of_Wittelsbach" title="wikilink">House of Wittelsbach</a>. The Archduke was also related to Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's older half-siblings, as his father was the younger brother of Brazilian Empress Leopoldina. They instantly fell in love with each other and were betrothed. The engagement, however, was never made official due to Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's early death.</p>
<h3 id="premature-death">Premature death</h3>
<p><img src="Death_of_princess_maria_amelia.jpg" title="fig:Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia&#39;s last moments with her mother at the bedside" alt="Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia&#39;s last moments with her mother at the bedside" width="200" /> In February 1852, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia contracted <a href="scarlet_fever" title="wikilink">scarlet fever</a>. As the months passed, she did not recover and was affected by a persistent cough&lt;U+2014&gt;the onset of tuberculosis. On 26 August, the princess departed from the Royal Palace of <a href="Caxias,_Oeiras" title="wikilink">Caxias</a>, where she lived, and traveled to the island of <a href="Madeira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>. The island's climate had a salutary reputation, as Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia noted: &quot;the fevers disappear, they say, as if by magic!&quot; As she said farewell to her family, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia may have felt an ill omen, since she asked her niece: &quot;Is it not true, <a href="Infanta_Maria_Anna_of_Portugal_(1843&lt;U+2013&gt;1884)" title="wikilink">Maria</a>, that you shall not forget me?!&quot;</p>
<p>Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia and her mother, who had accompanied her, disembarked on 31 August in <a href="Funchal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Funchal</a>, the capital of Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: &quot;If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay a long time in this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in <a href="Stein,_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Stein</a>!&quot; But her health only worsened, and by the end of November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: &quot;My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it ... we are reaching the beginning of the end.&quot; A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the <a href="last_rites" title="wikilink">last rites</a>. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia tried to comfort her mother: &quot;Do not cry ... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!&quot; She died later that morning at around 4 a.m.</p>
<p>The princess's body remained in the chapel until it was taken back to the Portuguese mainland on 7 May 1853. On 12 May, the coffin was disembarked at Lisbon, and a grandiose funeral followed. Her remains were interred next to her father's in the <a href="Monastery_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Vicente_de_Fora#Braganza_Pantheon" title="wikilink">Braganza Pantheon</a>, located in the <a href="Monastery_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Vicente_de_Fora" title="wikilink">Monastery of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Vicente de Fora</a>. Almost 130 years later, in 1982, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's remains were carried to Brazil and placed in the <em>Convento de Santo Ant&lt;U+00F4&gt;nio</em> (Convent of <a href="Anthony_of_Padua" title="wikilink">Saint Anthony</a>) in Rio de Janeiro, where other Brazilian royals are interred.</p>

<p><img src="Hospicio_d._princesa_maria_amelia.jpg" title="fig:Hospital Princesa D. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia" alt="Hospital Princesa D. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia" width="250" /> The death of Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia deeply touched those people who were close to her. Emperor Pedro II had never met his younger sister in person, but had developed a strong relationship with her through her letters. He wrote in his journal seven years after her death: &quot;I heard the mass for my sis[ter] Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia with whom I was so close and feel so sorry for never having met.&quot; Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie visited her daughter's tomb every 4 February until her own death. Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie financed the construction of a hospital in Funchal called &quot;<em>Princesa D. Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia</em>&quot; in her daughter's honor. The hospital is still in existence. Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie bequeathed her properties in Bavaria to Archduke Maximilian, &quot;whom [she] would [have felt] happy having as a son-in-law, had God conserved [her] beloved daughter Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia&quot;.</p>
<p>Archduke Maximilian was haunted by memories of his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. After his marriage to <a href="Charlotte_of_Belgium" title="wikilink">Charlotte of Belgium</a>, he made a personal pilgrimage to locations connected to Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia in 1859. Upon reaching the island of Madeira, he wrote:</p>

<p>In Funchal, he visited the hospital that bore Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's name. Maximilian financed, until his death, the maintenance of a double hospital room there. He also donated to the hospital, in memory of Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia, a statue of <a href="Our_Lady_of_Sorrows" title="wikilink">Our Lady of Sorrows</a>. From there, he went to the house (called <em>Quinta das Ang&lt;U+00FA&gt;stias</em>, or Anguish Villa) where she died. He wrote about this moment: &quot;... for a long time I stood silent amidst thoughts of sorrow and longing under the shadow of a magnificent tree that enfolds and protects the house where the angel, so bitterly wept for, ceased to exist&quot;. In his memoirs, Maximilian also mentioned the island of Madeira, and that it was there which was &quot;extinguished the life that seemed destined to guarantee my own tranquil happiness&quot;.</p>
<p>Maximilian departed from Madeira to Brazil, which he reached on 11 January 1869. He visited three Brazilian provinces during his trip. He was fascinated by Brazil, the only monarchy in South America. Years later, on 10 April 1864, he accepted a proposal to become emperor of the newly founded <a href="Second_Mexican_Empire" title="wikilink">Mexican Empire</a>. He had been inspired by the stability and prosperity he had observed while touring Brazil under the rule of his deceased fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e's elder brother, and believed that he could achieve the same results in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. On 19 June 1867, Maximilian was executed, after being <a href="French_Intervention_in_Mexico#1867:_Republicans_take_the_capital" title="wikilink">captured</a> by Mexican republicans. As he was stripped of all his belongings to face a firing squad, Maximilian asked that the small medallion of the <a href="Blessed_Virgin_Mary_(Roman_Catholic)" title="wikilink">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, which he wore about his neck, be sent to Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie (Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's mother). It was &quot;his last homage to Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia&quot;. While Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's life had little impact upon events in either Brazil or Portugal, her death had significant, if indirect, repercussions on the history of Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Dona</em> is a Portuguese and Brazilian honorific added to a name which is rendered in English as <a href="Dame_(title)" title="wikilink">Dame</a> or <a href="Lady" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lady</a>, in Italian as <em>Donna</em> and in Spanish as <em>Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em>. Its male equivalent in Portuguese is <a href="Dom_(title)" title="wikilink">Dom</a>, in English is <a href="Lord" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord</a> and in Spanish or Italian is <em><a href="Don_(honorific)" title="wikilink">Don</a></em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The information given is about Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's elder half-brother, but can be applied to her.</p></li>
<li><p>Aureliano Coutinho, the Viscount of Sepetiba, was a politician who headed the &quot;Courtier Faction&quot;, a political faction composed of high ranking palace servants and notable politicians. The courtiers exercised a strong influence over Pedro II, who was then no more than an adolescent. Once he matured and gained a full grasp of his capabilities, Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia's half-brother decisively engineered an end to the power held by the courtiers. By 1847, the Courtier Faction was no more. Why he overruled refusals by previous governments to recognize Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia as Brazilian princess in order to please the Emperor (e.g. engineered by people such as Sepetiba, whose position relied on staying in Pedro II's good graces) is not known.</p></li>
<li><p>Law 184 of 5 July 1841</p></li>
<li><p>Maximilian died in 1867, six years before Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lie. Her will disposed that if Maximilian had died without children, her properties would go to her nephew Nicholas, son of <a href="Maximilian_de_Beauharnais,_3rd&amp;nbsp;Duke_of_Leuchtenberg" title="wikilink">Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd&amp;nbsp;Duke of Leuchtenberg</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>First <a href="Bahia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahia</a>, then <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a> and lastly, <a href="Esp&lt;U+00ED&gt;rito_Santo" title="wikilink">Esp&lt;U+00ED&gt;rito Santo</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>As can be seeing in the letter dated 8 October 1864 that Maximilian sent to Pedro II when he was already living in Mexico as its emperor: &quot;The recollections that remain in me of the beautiful voyage that I made to Brazil is in my memory and I will never forget; it is with a lively interest that I see the fast development and constant prosperity of Your beautiful Empire. Thanks to the really liberal impulse that Your Majesty can give to its government, Brazil, in a state of peace that gives envy in the New World, works actively for both the public wealth and its general well-being.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The death of Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia created the need in Maximilian to relieve his &quot;troubled soul&quot; resulting in his tour of places associated with the princess. The search for links to Maria Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;lia eventually took him to Brazil, where he began to conceive a purpose for his empty life, and this in turn prompted his later acceptance of the Mexican crown with tragic results. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Maximilian called Pedro II &quot;tutor&quot; and regarded him as an &quot;example&quot;. Maximilian told his Brazilian cousin that whatever good he had done for Mexico had been a result of what he learned from Pedro II and Brazil on his 1860 trip.</p></li>
