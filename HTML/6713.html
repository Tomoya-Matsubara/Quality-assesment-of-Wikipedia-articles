<p>Banister played baseball at <a href="La_Marque_High_School" title="wikilink">La Marque High School</a> in <a href="La_Marque,_Texas" title="wikilink">La Marque, Texas</a>. He developed <a href="bone_cancer" title="wikilink">bone cancer</a> in his sophomore year, which almost necessitated the <a href="amputation" class="uri" title="wikilink">amputation</a> of his leg. While playing <a href="college_baseball" title="wikilink">college baseball</a> for <a href="Lee_College" title="wikilink">Lee College</a>, he suffered a <a href="home_plate" title="wikilink">home plate</a> collision that broke three <a href="vertebrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">vertebrae</a> in his neck, leaving him paralyzed for ten days. After rehabilitating, he was named a <a href="Junior_College" title="wikilink">Junior College</a> <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-American</a> the next season, and received a scholarship to the <a href="University_of_Houston" title="wikilink">University of Houston</a>, to play for the <a href="Houston_Cougars_baseball" title="wikilink">Houston Cougars baseball</a> team.

<p>Banister attended <a href="La_Marque_High_School" title="wikilink">La Marque High School</a> in <a href="La_Marque,_Texas" title="wikilink">La Marque, Texas</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At La Marque, Banister played for the school's <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, and <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, he was diagnosed with <a href="bone_cancer" title="wikilink">bone cancer</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He had developed <a href="cyst" title="wikilink">cysts</a> that required <a href="skin_grafting" title="wikilink">skin grafting</a> to treat. An infection in his leg led to the development of <a href="osteomyelitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteomyelitis</a>, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended <a href="amputation" class="uri" title="wikilink">amputation</a> in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a>, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>At a tryout conducted by professional <a href="scout_(sports)" title="wikilink">scouts</a>, Banister was noticed by the coaches at <a href="Lee_College" title="wikilink">Lee College</a>, a <a href="junior_college" title="wikilink">junior college</a> in <a href="Baytown,_Texas" title="wikilink">Baytown, Texas</a>. They recruited Banister to play <a href="college_baseball" title="wikilink">college baseball</a> at Lee.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> While catching in a 1983 game, he suffered a collision at <a href="home_plate" title="wikilink">home plate</a>, where the <a href="baserunner" class="uri" title="wikilink">baserunner</a> attempted to jump over him, and hit Banister in the head with his knee. The collision broke three of the <a href="vertebrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">vertebrae</a> in his neck. Banister was not originally scheduled to play in that game; a scout for the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> of <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) told Lee's coach that he hoped to see Banister catch, which resulted in Banister being added to the <a href="starting_lineup" title="wikilink">starting lineup</a> in a last-minute change. As a result of the collision, Banister was <a href="paralysis" title="wikilink">paralyzed</a> from the neck down for ten days. Doctors initially warned him that he may never walk again. He had another three operations performed on his back and learned how to walk again during the 1984 season. Entering the hospital weighing , he weighed  when he was discharged. Banister recovered and played another season for Lee in 1985, and was named a Junior College <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-American</a>.
