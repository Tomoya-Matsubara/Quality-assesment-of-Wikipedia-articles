<p>With the creation of the <a href="U.S._Highway_System" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway System</a> in 1926, the road between Reading and <a href="Lancaster,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a> was designated US 222 while the road between Reading and <a href="Allentown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Allentown</a> was part of <a href="U.S._Route_22_in_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">US 22</a>, which ran along what was designated the <a href="William_Penn_Highway" title="wikilink">William Penn Highway</a> in 1916 and <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_3_(1920s)" title="wikilink">PA 3</a> in 1924. In the late 1920s, US 222 briefly ran concurrent with <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_41" title="wikilink">PA 41</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_240_(1920s)" title="wikilink">PA 240</a> at different times. <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_42" title="wikilink">PA 42</a> originally ran north-south through Reading starting in 1927. By 1930, the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222 and US 22. US 222 entered Reading along with <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_73" title="wikilink">PA 73</a> along Lancaster Avenue and Bingaman Street before turning north on 9th Street along with <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_83" title="wikilink">PA 83</a> to end at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. US 22 continued north on 9th Street out of Reading and continued along Kutztown Road through Temple toward Allentown. <a href="U.S._Route_120" title="wikilink">US 120</a> began at US 222 at Bingaman Street and headed north on 4th Street and Center Street out of Reading. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between <a href="Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Harrisburg</a> and Allentown, and US 222 was extended north along the former alignment between Reading and Allentown. US 222 was shifted to use Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street and 5th Street Highway through the Reading area in the 1930s, running concurrent with <a href="U.S._Route_122_(1935&lt;U+2013&gt;1963)" title="wikilink">US 122</a> through downtown Reading. The US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed by 1966. In 1975, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Reading on the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass, with the former alignment through the city becoming US 222 Bus. In 1998, US 222 Bus. was extended north to its current terminus following the rerouting of US 222 to a new outer bypass of Reading. The business route was extended south to its current endpoint in 2004 with the completion of the US 222 freeway south of Reading to <a href="Mohnton,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Mohnton</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the route heading southwest out of Reading toward <a href="Lancaster,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a> was legislated as Legislative Route 148 while the route heading from Reading northeast toward <a href="Allentown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Allentown</a> was legislated as Legislative Route 157.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1916, the road between Reading and Allentown became a part of the <a href="William_Penn_Highway" title="wikilink">William Penn Highway</a>, an <a href="auto_trail" title="wikilink">auto trail</a> that ran from <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. In 1924, the William Penn Highway was designated as <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_3_(1920s)" title="wikilink">PA 3</a> with the establishment of the first state route numbers in Pennsylvania.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> With the establishment of the <a href="U.S._Highway_System" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway System</a> in 1926, the route heading from Reading southwest to Lancaster was designated as US 222 while the route heading from Reading to Allentown along the William Penn Highway was designated as part of <a href="U.S._Route_22_in_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">US 22</a>, which ran concurrent with PA 3.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1927, <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_41" title="wikilink">PA 41</a> was designated concurrent with US 222 between Lancaster and Reading and <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_42" title="wikilink">PA 42</a> ran north-south through downtown Reading.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A year later, the concurrent PA 41 designation along US 222 between Lancaster and Reading was replaced with <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_240_(1920s)" title="wikilink">PA 240</a>. In addition, <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_73" title="wikilink">PA 73</a> ran concurrent with US 222/PA 240 between New Holland Avenue, where it split south, and downtown Reading.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By 1930, the concurrent PA 240 designation was removed from US 222 while the concurrent PA 3 designation was removed from US 22. At this time, US 222 entered Reading on Lancaster Avenue, where it became concurrent with PA 73 at New Holland Avenue and interseced the northern terminus of PA 42 at Morgantown Road. US 222/PA 73 crossed the Schuylkill River on Bingaman Street and intersected the southern terminus of <a href="U.S._Route_120" title="wikilink">US 120</a>, which headed north on 4th Street and Center Street, and continued northeast to intersect <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_83" title="wikilink">PA 83</a> at 9th Street. Here, PA 73 continued northeast on Bingaman Street and US 222 turned north concurrent with PA 83 on 9th Street to reach its northern terminus at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. At this intersection, PA 83 turned west along with US 22 on Penn Street and US 22 continued north along 9th Street out of Reading, where it continued north through South Temple and Temple on Kutztown Road.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1931, plans were made to reroute US 22 and the William Penn Highway to a more direct alignment between <a href="Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Harrisburg</a> and Allentown by way of <a href="Pennsylvania_Route_43_(1920s)" title="wikilink">PA 43</a>. As a result of the rerouting of US 22, the road between Harrisburg and Reading would become a western extension of US 422 while the road between Reading and Allentown would become a northern extension of US 222. The changes were approved by the <a href="American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials" title="wikilink">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> on June 8, 1931.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the 1930s, US 222 was shifted to follow 5th Street north through Reading and 5th Street Highway through Muhlenberg Township. <a href="U.S._Route_122_(1935&lt;U+2013&gt;1963)" title="wikilink">US 122</a> replaced the PA 42 designation south of Reading and the US 120 designation north of Reading and was routed to run concurrent with US 222 on Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street between Morgantown Road and Center Street.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> By 1966, the US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed from US 222 through Reading.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> US 222 was split into a one-way pair along 5th Street northbound and 4th Street southbound between Laurel and Chestnut streets.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>On November 15, 1975, the <a href="American_Association_of_State_Highway_and_Transportation_Officials" title="wikilink">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) approved rerouting US 222 to bypass downtown Reading to the west along the limited-access West Shore Bypass (where it ran concurrent with US 422) and the Warren Street Bypass. As a result, US 222 Bus. was designated onto the former alignment of US 222 between US 222/US 422 (West Shore Bypass) and US 222 (Warren Street Bypass).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1998, the Park Road Corridor was completed, and US 222 was rerouted to follow a new freeway alignment from the Warren Street Bypass northwest to Van Reed Road, where it turned northeast along what was called to the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; to end at its original alignment in Ontelanuee Township. As a result, US 222 Bus. was extended north from the Warren Street Bypass, which had been redesignated PA 12, to the north end of the US 222 freeway in Ontelanuee Township.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 2004, the US 222 freeway was extended south from PA 724 to Grings Hill Road in Mohnton, and US 222 was rerouted south from Wyomissing along the Warren Street Bypass and the new freeway. As a result, US 222 Bus. was extended south from US 422 (West Shore Bypass) to its current southern terminus.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
