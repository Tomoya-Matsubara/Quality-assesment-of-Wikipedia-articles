<p><strong>Herne Hill railway station</strong> is a passenger <a href="railway_station" title="wikilink">railway station</a> in <a href="Herne_Hill" title="wikilink">Herne Hill</a> in the <a href="London_Borough_of_Lambeth" title="wikilink">London Borough of Lambeth</a>, <a href="South_London" title="wikilink">South London</a>, England, on the boundary between <a href="London_fare_zones" title="wikilink">London fare zones</a> 2 and 3. Direct <a href="Rail_transport" title="wikilink">rail services</a> are provided by <a href="First_Capital_Connect" title="wikilink">First Capital Connect</a> to <a href="Blackfriars_station" title="wikilink">London Blackfriars</a>, <a href="Farringdon_station" title="wikilink">Farringdon</a>, <a href="St_Pancras_railway_station" title="wikilink">St. Pancras International</a> and <a href="Luton_Airport_Parkway_railway_station" title="wikilink">Luton Airport</a> on the <a href="Thameslink" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thameslink</a> route and by <a href="Southeastern_(train_operating_company)" title="wikilink">Southeastern</a> to <a href="London_Victoria_station" title="wikilink">London Victoria</a> and <a href="Orpington_railway_station" title="wikilink">Orpington</a> on the <a href="Chatham_Main_Line" title="wikilink">Chatham Main Line</a>. Trains to Victoria call at <a href="Brixton_railway_station" title="wikilink">Brixton</a>, where passengers can transfer to the <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London Underground</a>.</p>
<p>The station building on <a href="Railton_Road" title="wikilink">Railton Road</a> was opened in 1862 by the <a href="London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway" title="wikilink">London, Chatham and Dover Railway</a>. Initially passengers could travel only to Victoria, but by 1869 direct services were available to the <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City of London</a>, <a href="King&#39;s_Cross_Thameslink_railway_station" title="wikilink">King's Cross</a>, <a href="Kingston_railway_station_(London)" title="wikilink">Kingston</a> (via <a href="Wimbledon_station" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a>) and <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>, including express trains to <a href="List_of_railway_stations_in_Dover#Former_stations" title="wikilink">Dover Harbour</a> for <a href="boat_train" title="wikilink">boat trains</a> to continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.</p>
<p>The future pattern of passenger services is uncertain. <a href="Network_Rail" title="wikilink">Network Rail</a> has recommended terminating all northbound First Capital Connect services from Herne Hill at Blackfriars from 2018; passengers for other central London stations on the Thameslink route would then have to change trains at Blackfriars.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Herne Hill railway station sits at the bottom of the hill that gives the area its name and is close to <a href="Brockwell_Park" title="wikilink">Brockwell Park</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The section of Railton Road outside the station is <a href="Living_street" title="wikilink">mixed usage</a> for pedestrians and vehicles.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Chatham_Main_Line" title="wikilink">Chatham Main Line</a> and <a href="Sutton_Loop" title="wikilink">Sutton Loop</a> railway lines through Herne Hill are elevated above road-level on a brick <a href="viaduct" class="uri" title="wikilink">viaduct</a> that runs north&lt;U+2013&gt;south. The station's 1862 <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a>, <a href="polychrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">polychrome</a> brick<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> building is on the western side of the viaduct, although passengers can also access the station from the east via a foot tunnel entrance on Milkwood Road.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The building houses a ticket office and newsagent, and was <a href="Listed_building" title="wikilink">Grade II listed</a> in 1998: the listing notes the station's arched doorways, Welsh slate roof and decorative brickwork.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It was described by <a href="Pevsner_Architectural_Guides" title="wikilink">Cherry and Pevsner</a> as a &quot;handsome group&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and featured on the cover of a book about London's railway architecture.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The four platforms are split between two <a href="island_platform" title="wikilink">island platforms</a>;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> northbound trains call at the western platform and southbound trains at the eastern platform,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> providing passengers with <a href="cross-platform_interchange" title="wikilink">cross-platform interchange</a> between the two routes.</p>
<p>There are <a href="Level_junction" title="wikilink">flat junctions</a> at each end of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to <a href="Loughborough_Junction_railway_station" title="wikilink">Loughborough Junction</a> and <a href="Brixton_railway_station" title="wikilink">Brixton</a> stations diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to <a href="West_Dulwich_railway_station" title="wikilink">West Dulwich</a> and <a href="Tulse_Hill_railway_station" title="wikilink">Tulse Hill</a> stations diverge.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> First Capital Connect and Southeastern services must cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The station also has a <a href="Siding_(rail)" title="wikilink">turnback siding</a> (requiring the driver to change from one end of the train to the other) on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The area now known as Herne Hill had been a rural part of the Manor of Milkwell since the 13th century.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Two <a href="Tributary" title="wikilink">tributaries</a> of the <a href="River_Effra" title="wikilink">River Effra</a> met at the undeveloped site of the future station;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> it was known as Island Green until the 18th century.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1783, a timber merchant, Samuel Sanders, bought Herne Hill from the Manor.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Sanders granted leases for large plots of land to wealthy families – <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a> spent his childhood at an estate on Herne Hill. The Effra was covered over in the 1820s;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and the area had become an upper-class suburb by the mid-19th century (a contemporary author referred to the hill as &quot;the Elysium&quot; for merchants).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The opening of the railway station, which provided convenient and cheap access to central London, started the urbanisation of Herne Hill.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> All of the large estates were eventually cleared to make way for many smaller houses.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> An 1870 railway travel guide noted the population of Herne Hill was 701;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> the contemporaneous development of new residential streets would increase the population by 3,000.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>In the late 1850s, the <a href="East_Kent_Railway" title="wikilink">East Kent Railway</a> had ambitions to run passenger trains between Kent and London, but it did not own any railway lines in inner London. It reached an agreement with the <a href="London,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway" title="wikilink">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> (LB&amp;SCR) in 1858 to use its <a href="West_End_of_London_and_Crystal_Palace_Railway" title="wikilink">West End and Crystal Palace line</a> to access <a href="Battersea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Battersea</a> and (from 1860) <a href="London_Victoria_station" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. This arrangement incurred costly access fees, but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 1860, the Metropolitan Extensions Act granted the <a href="London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway" title="wikilink">London, Chatham and Dover Railway</a> (LCDR; the successor to the East Kent company) the right to build two inner London lines: one from <a href="Beckenham_Junction_station" title="wikilink">Beckenham Junction</a> to Victoria via Herne Hill; and another, a  extension known as the <a href="London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway#Second_London_line" title="wikilink">City Branch</a>, from Herne Hill to <a href="Farringdon_station" title="wikilink">Farringdon</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Herne Hill station and the first line section to be completed, from Victoria to Herne Hill via <a href="Stewarts_Lane" title="wikilink">Stewarts Lane</a> and , opened on 25 August 1862.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <img src="Herne_Hill_Station_1863.jpg" title="fig:An illustration from The Building News; note the stairway on the left for accessing the upper floor, and the wider canopy.|alt=Black and white line drawing of a two story gothic revival building having a square tower to its left and a railway viaduct to the right." alt="An illustration from The Building News; note the stairway on the left for accessing the upper floor, and the wider canopy.|alt=Black and white line drawing of a two story gothic revival building having a square tower to its left and a railway viaduct to the right." /> The station was designed by architect <a href="John_Taylor_(architect)" title="wikilink">John Taylor</a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and railway engineers <a href="Joseph_Cubitt" title="wikilink">Joseph Cubitt</a> and J.T. Turner.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The building was intended to impress: it had tea rooms offering buffets,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> decorative brickwork and a tower (which also served the practical function of concealing the water tank for steam locomotives).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <em>The Building News</em> described the station in 1863 as &quot;spacious and convenient ... and of the very best quality&quot;. It also stated that &quot;an unusual amount of decorative taste has been displayed&quot; in the station's construction; even the viaduct was praised as &quot;one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway&quot; for its fine brickwork.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The station's design prompted the journal to write a 2,000-word editorial bemoaning the comparatively poor architectural quality of other contemporary civil engineering projects.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> An architectural critic later noted the station was &quot;eulogised&quot; by journals upon its opening and that its architecture was still seen as exemplary at the end of the 19th century.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>There were initially two platforms at the station: <a href="Railroad_direction#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">up and down</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Up was accessed from the upper floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building and down from an island platform. The station's original <a href="Signalling_control" title="wikilink">signal box</a>, elevated above the railway viaduct at the junction between Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, was a prominent feature in Herne Hill for many years.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The land for the station was compulsorily purchased from Thomas Vyse, manufacturer of straw hats and owner of the Abbey, an estate at 70 Herne Hill; the station and much of the viaduct were built on part of the Abbey's grounds.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A new road (appropriately, Station Road) was built from the station to the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, Herne Hill's main thoroughfare.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>On 6 October 1863, the City Branch opened from Herne Hill as far as , via  and  (the platforms at <a href="Loughborough_Junction_railway_station" title="wikilink">Loughborough Junction</a>, now the closest station to Herne Hill, opened in 1872).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The line from Beckenham Junction reached Herne Hill from the south in July 1863,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> connecting the station to the LCDR's lines in Kent, and finally allowing the LCDR to avoid using the LB&amp;SCR's tracks to access Victoria from Kent.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> By June 1864, the City Branch had been extended to <a href="Blackfriars_Bridge_railway_station" title="wikilink">Blackfriars Bridge railway station</a> (on the south bank of the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>) via .<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Blackfriars_Railway_Bridge" title="wikilink">Blackfriars Railway Bridge</a> was then built across the Thames and a terminus for trains from the south opened at <a href="Ludgate_Hill_railway_station" title="wikilink">Ludgate Hill</a> on 1 June 1865.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>  <a href="Snow_Hill_tunnel" title="wikilink">Snow Hill tunnel</a> opened on 1 January 1866, enabling trains from Herne Hill to reach Farringdon and completing the Metropolitan Extension.

<p>From July 1863, the LCDR's trains between Victoria and Kent ran through Herne Hill. Passengers could travel to destinations in continental Europe via a connecting steamboat from <a href="List_of_railway_stations_in_Dover#Former_stations" title="wikilink">Dover Harbour</a> to <a href="Calais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calais</a>;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> these <a href="boat_train" title="wikilink">boat train</a> services left Victoria and Ludgate Hill simultaneously and were joined at Herne Hill.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Express journeys from Herne Hill to Dover, a distance of , took 1 hour, 36 minutes, at an average speed of .<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Services to London were split at Herne Hill to give passengers easier access to the <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City of London</a> and beyond;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> the LCDR began operating direct services to <a href="King&#39;s_Cross_Thameslink_railway_station" title="wikilink">King's Cross</a> and Barnet (now <a href="High_Barnet_tube_station" title="wikilink">High Barnet tube station</a>) from Herne Hill when Snow Hill tunnel opened.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>A popular workmen's train (one <a href="&lt;U+00A3&gt;sd" title="wikilink">penny</a> per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains left from both termini at 04:55 and returned at 18:15.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The LCDR was compelled to operate this service by Parliament to compensate for the large number of working class homes destroyed in <a href="Camberwell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camberwell</a> during the construction of the City Branch.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eight pence, six pence and four pence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one <a href="&lt;U+00A3&gt;sd" title="wikilink">shilling</a>, nine pence and seven pence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express services and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Both the <a href="Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">Great Northern Railway</a> (GNR) and the <a href="London_and_South_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">London and South Western Railway</a> (LSWR) helped fund the Metropolitan Extensions (&lt;U+00A3&gt;320,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;310,000 respectively; &lt;U+00A3&gt; and &lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ) in return for the right to use the LCDR's tracks.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The GNR ran trains between <a href="Hatfield_railway_station" title="wikilink">Hatfield</a> and Herne Hill from August 1866 until March 1868 (when the trains were diverted to Victoria via Loughborough Junction);<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> this was a busy all-stops service, with 15 trains leaving Hatfield and 14 leaving Herne Hill every day.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The LSWR began running trains between Ludgate Hill and <a href="Wimbledon_station" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a> via Herne Hill when the Tulse Hill extension was completed.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Some of these services went as far as <a href="Kingston_railway_station_(London)" title="wikilink">Kingston</a> until the mid-1890s.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="changes-from-1870-to-1923">Changes from 1870 to 1923</h3>
<p>By 1870, a track had been added to the east of the station and two sidings had been added to the west;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> one of the western sidings was a <a href="bay_platform" title="wikilink">bay platform</a> for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <a href="Interlocking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Interlocking</a> signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The LCDR enlarged the station in 1884 to meet growing demand: the viaduct was widened to allow for the construction of a second island platform and two lines to the east<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> (the easternmost line was used only for freight<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a>); and the foot tunnel under the viaduct was opened. In 1885, the LCDR decided to use <a href="Blackfriars_Bridge_railway_station" title="wikilink">Blackfriars Bridge railway station</a> solely as a goods yard but lacked the space to sort wagons at the site.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It purchased  of land between Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction for this purpose.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings had some 35 sidings, the longest of which was .<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> A stationmaster's house was built at 239 Railton Road in the mid-1880s as the site offered a good view of the station (it is now privately owned).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In 1888, Railton Road was extended to the Norwood Road/Half Moon Lane junction and Station Road ceased to exist.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <img src="Herne_Hill_railway_OS_Map_1894.jpg" title="fig:An 1894 Ordnance Survey map showing the station&#39;s layout" alt="An 1894 Ordnance Survey map showing the station&#39;s layout" /> At the beginning of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring <a href="South_Eastern_Railway,_UK" title="wikilink">South Eastern Railway</a> (SER) handed over operation of their services to the newly-formed <a href="South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railway" title="wikilink">South Eastern and Chatham Railway</a> (SECR), which was jointly owned by the two railways.

<p>In 1900, it was suggested in <em><a href="The_Contemporary_Review" title="wikilink">The Contemporary Review</a></em> that the City Branch should be replaced with an electric deep-level railway (i.e. a 'tube' line) between Herne Hill and Farringdon in order to remove Blackfriars Railway Bridge, which the author considered to be a blight on the Thames.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>A late-night service from Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The intention was to satisfy journalists on <a href="Fleet_Street" title="wikilink">Fleet Street</a> who regularly complained in print about the poor quality of service on the line; those working on the morning papers often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Services to Farringdon from Herne Hill were discontinued in 1916 with the closure of Snow Hill tunnel to passengers, and trains from the south terminated at <a href="Holborn_Viaduct_railway_station" title="wikilink">Holborn Viaduct</a> instead.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The LCDR amalgamated with the LB&amp;SCR, SER and several other railways to form the <a href="Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">Southern Railway</a> at the start of 1923.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="modernisation">Modernisation</h3>
<p>Work began on electrifying the former LCDR suburban routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled as part of these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west (allowing two tracks to be laid between the island platforms); the western sidings were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt <a href="Railway_electrification_in_Great_Britain#650_V_-_750_V_DC,_third_rail" title="wikilink">third-rail system</a> came into operation on both routes through Herne Hill: from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line and along the entire length of the City Branch. Electric passenger services ran every 20 minutes on both routes during the day<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and electric trains were kept overnight at the sorting sidings, north of the station.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <img src="Herne_Hill_Station_Norwood_2012.jpg" title="fig:The railway bridge over the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane" alt="The railway bridge over the junction of Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane" /> The distinctive signal box overlooking Norwood Road and a similar signal box at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from <a href="Railway_semaphore_signal" title="wikilink">semaphores</a> to <a href="Railway_signal#Colour_light_signals" title="wikilink">colour lights</a> on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1959, the pattern of commuter services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it would hold into the 21st century: all-stop trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via <a href="West_Croydon_station" title="wikilink">West Croydon</a>).<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> However, there was a decline in the number of electric passenger services on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and <a href="Shortlands_railway_station" title="wikilink">Shortlands</a> in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="to-present">1988 to present</h3>
<p>In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and the former LCDR City Branch formed the basis of the new <a href="Thameslink" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thameslink</a> route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key objective of the <a href="Thameslink_Programme" title="wikilink">Thameslink Programme</a> was allowing more trains to travel between central London and <a href="Brighton_railway_station" title="wikilink">Brighton</a>, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic <a href="Borough_Market" title="wikilink">Borough Market</a>. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a <a href="Overpass" title="wikilink">fly-over</a> to connect the southern end of the new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill).<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink services serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>During the initial planning in the late 1980s for <a href="High_Speed_1" title="wikilink">High Speed 1</a> (HS1; a high-speed railway line between London and the <a href="Channel_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Channel Tunnel</a>), <a href="British_Rail" title="wikilink">British Rail</a> considered building the line to serve a low-level station at <a href="London_King&#39;s_Cross_railway_station" title="wikilink">King's Cross</a> via south London.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> it was estimated that this would have led to the loss of 90&lt;U+2013&gt;180 homes in Lambeth.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Although both a different route and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), <a href="Eurostar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurostar</a> services linking <a href="London_Waterloo_station" title="wikilink">London Waterloo</a> to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed. <img src="Herne_Hill_railway_station_-_Upper_floor_entrances.jpg" title="fig:The sealed entrances and windows of the station&#39;s upper floor" alt="The sealed entrances and windows of the station&#39;s upper floor" /> The upper floor of the station, which had not been used by passengers since 1925, was converted into  of office space in 1991 and rented as 'Tower House' (after the station's distinctive tower).<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The disused freight line to the east of the station was partly reopened in 2009 as a siding for use by First Capital Connect trains to compensate for the loss of sidings when the <a href="Moorgate_station" title="wikilink">Moorgate</a> Thameslink branch was closed.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The line's connection to the south junction was severed during these works. The station had become fully accessible by 2010: lifts were installed to provide step-free access to the platforms in 2008<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> and a unisex disabled-accessible toilet was opened on the southbound platforms in 2010.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="accidents-and-disruption">Accidents and disruption</h3>
<p>Railway services through Herne Hill were affected by <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Passenger services on the City Branch were reduced from September 1939 to once every 30 minutes during the week and hourly at weekends;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and the line was cut twice during <a href="the_Blitz" title="wikilink">the Blitz</a>. On the second occasion, the railway bridge over Hinton Road (immediately south of Loughborough Junction) was destroyed.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The route between Holborn Viaduct and Herne Hill was disrupted by 62 incidents during the war.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

One passenger onboard the electric train was killed and nine others were hospitalised.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>A minor accident occurred on 30 June 1957. A light engine, travelling towards Tulse Hill, was waiting to cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger service from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express train were hospitalised but quickly discharged.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>A second fatal collision occurred at the sorting sidings, just north of the station, on 1 April 1960 in fog that reduced visibility to . A steam locomotive was waiting on the southbound track outside Herne Hill for a proceed signal when the signalman cleared an electric passenger service (behind the steam locomotive) to proceed down the same track. The steam locomotive was struck from behind, destroying it and killing the electric train's driver.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>On 8 May 2004, there was a security alert at the station after a train driver reported seeing a man in camouflage gear with a rocket launcher on a platform. In fact, the man was a local <a href="Street_performance" title="wikilink">busker</a> carrying a <a href="didgeridoo" class="uri" title="wikilink">didgeridoo</a>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>The route through the station will be busier from 2015 as Thameslink trains serving <a href="London_Bridge_station" title="wikilink">London Bridge</a> will be diverted via Herne Hill<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> - an additional four trains per hour in both directions.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> This is due to the <a href="London_Bridge_station#Future_development" title="wikilink">redevelopment of London Bridge</a> that will temporarily close it to <a href="Thameslink#Route" title="wikilink">Bedford-Brighton</a> trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; instead, they will run fast between <a href="Blackfriars_station" title="wikilink">London Blackfriars</a> and <a href="East_Croydon_station" title="wikilink">East Croydon</a>.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> It would not be possible for the 12-car peak services to call at Herne Hill in any event as the station's platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use <a href="selective_door_operation" title="wikilink">selective door operation</a> as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> <img src="Herne_Hill_Station_Layout_2012_(Revised).png" title="fig:Contemporary layout of tracks and structures at Herne Hill station" alt="Contemporary layout of tracks and structures at Herne Hill station" /></p>
<p><a href="Network_Rail" title="wikilink">Network Rail</a>, in its July 2011 London &amp; South East <a href="route_utilisation_strategy" title="wikilink">route utilisation strategy</a>, has recommended that all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate in the <a href="Bay_platform" title="wikilink">bay platforms</a> at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> and the diverted Thameslink trains return there.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Passengers from Herne Hill would then have to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail has made this recommendation because more services will be using the route between <a href="St_Pancras_railway_station" title="wikilink">St. Pancras</a> and London Bridge from 2018;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms on the western side of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on the eastern side of the station) will remove the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from <a href="Denmark_Hill" title="wikilink">Denmark Hill</a> and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>It is anticipated there will be six trains to Blackfriars from Herne Hill during peak hours from 2018 (four from Sutton and two from Kent House) and four trains from Sutton during off-peak hours.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> There will also be two trains between <a href="Medway" title="wikilink">Medway, Kent</a> and Blackfriars via Herne Hill during peak hours, but they will not call at the station.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Department_for_Transport" title="wikilink">Department for Transport</a> has yet to decide whether the Sutton Loop will remain part of the Thameslink service after 2018 and receive the <a href="Thameslink_rolling_stock_programme" title="wikilink">new Thameslink trains</a>.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> In the longer term, Network Rail has forecast that by 2031 there will be 900 more passengers attempting to travel on the route between Herne Hill and Blackfriars during the busiest peak hour every weekday than can be accommodated on the trains.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> It is anticipated that eight-car trains with higher capacity (similar to the <a href="British_Rail_Class_378" title="wikilink">Class 378</a> trains used on inner London metro routes) will eventually be required to address this shortfall.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
