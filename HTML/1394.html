The team was established in November 2007 as an MLS expansion team. The following year fans chose the Sounders name for the team through an online poll.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Before teams in Major League Soccer had played their first match and before the selection of the first cities MLS teams would represent, Seattle was considered a viable location that could support a professional soccer team at the highest level in the United States.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1994, as the United States was in the final preparations to host the <a href="1994_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">World Cup</a>, Seattle was one of more than 30 cities that expressed interest in acquiring an MLS team.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, even in 1994, the absence of a &quot;soccer-only stadium&quot; was recognized as a key factor that would keep the MLS away from the strong soccer fan base in the Seattle area.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Another criterion needed for considering a city for getting an inaugural MLS team was to secure 10,000 deposits for season tickets.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had only exceeded 1,300 total deposits.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This was because at the same time that the season ticket campaign for the MLS team was taking place, a competing season ticket effort was happening for the <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(USL)" title="wikilink">APSL Sounders</a> expansion team.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In a June 14, 1994 announcement, Seattle was not included among the first 7 cities to receive MLS teams, though 5 more cities would be announced later that year.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In an effort to improve their chances, Seattle MLS organizers began working with the <a href="University_of_Washington" title="wikilink">University of Washington</a> to use <a href="Husky_Stadium" title="wikilink">Husky Stadium</a> as an interim stadium while they pursued the construction of a permanent soccer-specific facility.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In November 1994, as the start of first MLS season was postponed another year (from 1995 to 1996) it was noted that the absence of an adequate grass-field facility in the area and the presence of the new APSL Seattle Sounders team had hurt momentum for Seattle's MLS bid.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Seattle was not among the cities to have a team play in the first MLS season.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1996, as <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a> owner <a href="Paul_Allen" title="wikilink">Paul Allen</a> worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Indeed many of the state's voters passed the stadium referendum that resulted in the construction of Seahawk Stadium because it was promoted as a venue for professional soccer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Unfortunately, as the stadium problem in Seattle resolved itself, a new problem emerged. By 2000, the MLS was moving away from league-operated teams, so in order for Seattle to get an MLS expansion team, an investor would need to step forward.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, as the 10-team MLS announced plans to expand into 2 new markets in the next few seasons, Seattle was again listed as a possibility.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, when the second of these 2 expansion teams was awarded to Salt Lake in 2004, MLS commissioner Don Garber indicated that Seattle had been &quot;very close&quot; to getting that expansion.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Adrian Hanauer, then owner of the USL Sounders (formerly the APSL Sounders), was working with MLS discussing an estimated payment of $1 million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> When Seattle was passed over again in the expansion for the 2006 season, Hanauer announced that he would not be able to secure the expansion team without the help of more investors willing to help cover the increasing MLS expansion fees which at the time had grown to $10 M.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="it-all-comes-together">It all comes together</h3>
<p>Finally, in 2007, Hanauer worked with Hollywood producer <a href="Joe_Roth" title="wikilink">Joe Roth</a> to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle at an estimated cost of $30 &lt;U+2013&gt; $35 million.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> That same year, Paul Allen, whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field (formerly Seahawks Stadium), joined the ownership group making this bid for expansion the most promising yet.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> During the first week of November 2007, rumors began to build that the MLS would be announcing the expansion into Seattle the following week and that the ownership group had taken on a fourth member: comedian <a href="Drew_Carey" title="wikilink">Drew Carey</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In a press conference on November 13, 2007, the city of Seattle was awarded an expansion team.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The announcement provided a continuation to a long-standing soccer tradition in Seattle that has included the <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(NASL)" title="wikilink">Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League</a> from 1974 to 1983 and the <a href="Seattle_Sounders_(USL)" title="wikilink">Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division</a> from 1994 to 2008.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="team-name-badge-and-colors-unveiled">Team name, badge and colors unveiled</h3>
<p>Seattle Sounders FC was announced as the team name on April 7, 2008, along with the team logo, colors and badge design in a presentation held at the <a href="Space_Needle" title="wikilink">Space Needle</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The badge design, loosely resembling a <a href="Escutcheon_(heraldry)" title="wikilink">heraldic shield</a>, consists of two layers representing the partnership between the ownership, the community, the players, and the fans. The logo incorporates the Space Needle, an internationally recognized Seattle landmark. The official team colors are Sounder Blue, representing the waters of the <a href="Puget_Sound" title="wikilink">Puget Sound</a>; Rave Green, representing the forests of the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a>; and Cascade Shale, representing the <a href="Cascade_Range" title="wikilink">Cascade Range</a> to the east of Seattle.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Fans were able to choose a new name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and March 31, 2008. When the possible names to be selected from were initially announced, only three names were to be included on the poll: Seattle FC, Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance, with the Seattle Sounders name being left off to provide a &quot;fresh start.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Despite the names having been selected by fan focus groups, internal committees, and fan suggestions, the lack of an option to continue the Seattle Sounders moniker was an unpopular decision.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In response to the reaction by the fans, the team added a fourth &quot;write in&quot; option for the team name, leaving the door open to any suggestion.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the 14,500 votes received for the new team name, 49% of the votes were a derivative of the name Sounders.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Upon announcing the name, Hanauer acknowledged the significance of keeping with tradition: &lt;U+201C&gt;The team playing at the highest level in our region has always been called Sounders. Starting with the NASL and then the USL 1st Division, we now have the chance to create a separate and distinct identity with the new MLS team.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Team ownership revealed the first Sounders jersey on May 28, 2008, and announced <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a> and <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a> as the team's sponsor in a 5 year deal worth $20 M.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As part of the agreement, the Xbox 360 and <a href="Xbox_Live" title="wikilink">Xbox Live</a> brands are featured prominently on the front of the jersey and throughout the stadium.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Seattle Sounders FC began play in the 2009 season and is the league's 15th team. Sounders FC played their first game on March 19, 2009, to a sold-out crowd of 32,523, defeating the <a href="Red_Bull_New_York" title="wikilink">New York Red Bulls</a> 3-0.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Seattle was the first MLS expansion team to win their first three games, and they did so with a clean sheet in each.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="golden-scarf">Golden Scarf</h3>
<p>During the pregame ceremonies of the Sounders FC inaugural home game a Golden Scarf, emblazoned with the Sounders name, was awarded to MLS Commissioner <a href="Don_Garber" title="wikilink">Don Garber</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> This began a tradition where before each home game the club honors a member of the community with the presentation of the Golden Scarf, symbolizing the game of soccer. The honored recipient raises the scarf over their heads, signaling to the fans to do the same. Because of the arrangement of the ceremony, the club has the opportunity to honor a presenter as well.</p>

Based on the fan association at <a href="FC_Barcelona" title="wikilink">Barcelona</a>, members of the Alliance will have the ability to vote on the removal of the General Manager and on other team decisions. Season ticket holders become automatic members while non-season ticket holders may buy into the Association for a fee. Membership grants the members voting privileges, invitation to an annual meeting and other team perks. Members can be nominated and selected to the Sounders FC Association Council on a yearly basis. The first vote on the General Manager is scheduled to be held November 2012 following that season.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Another of Carey's requests prior to his involvement with the team was that the team would have a <a href="marching_band" title="wikilink">marching band</a>, which would make it the only professional soccer franchise in America with one.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 52-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In a meeting on December 5, 2008, the Members Alliance voted on the official name of the band.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The band plays music from multiple genres such as Latin, funk, big band, pop and rock, and sits with the supporters in north end of Qwest Field.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The March to the Match, in which fans and ticket holders march from <a href="Occidental_Park" title="wikilink">Occidental Park</a> to Qwest before each home game, is led by the Sound Wave.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
