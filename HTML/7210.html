<p><strong>Hurricane Katrina</strong> of the <a href="2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> was the costliest <a href="North_Atlantic_tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">hurricane</a>, as well as one of the five deadliest, in the history of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Among recorded Atlantic hurricanes, it was the <a href="List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes#Listed_by_minimum_pressure" title="wikilink">sixth strongest overall</a>. Hurricane Katrina formed over the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a> on August 23, 2005, and crossed southern <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> as a moderate <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale#Category_1" title="wikilink">Category 1 hurricane</a>, causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The storm weakened before making its second landfall as a <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale#Category_3" title="wikilink">Category 3</a> storm on the morning of Monday, August 29 in southeast Louisiana. It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the <a href="storm_surge" title="wikilink">storm surge</a>. The most severe <a href="Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">loss of life and property damage</a> occurred in <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, which flooded as the <a href="levee" class="uri" title="wikilink">levee</a> system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The <a href="Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" title="wikilink">federal flood protection</a> system in New Orleans failed at more than fifty places. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans was breached as Hurricane Katrina passed just east of the city limits. Eventually 80% of the city became flooded and also large tracts of neighboring <a href="list_of_parishes_of_Louisiana" title="wikilink">parishes</a>, and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At least 1,836 people lost their lives in the actual hurricane and in the subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the<a href="1928_Okeechobee_hurricane" title="wikilink">1928 Okeechobee hurricane</a>. Economist and Crisis Consultant <a href="Randall_Bell" title="wikilink">Randall Bell</a>, brought into the area after the levee failures, writes in his book, <em>Real Estate Damages</em>, &quot;Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the largest natural disaster in the history of the United States. Preliminary damage estimates were well in excess of $100 billion, eclipsing many times the damage wrought by <a href="Hurricane_Andrew" title="wikilink">Hurricane Andrew</a> in 1992.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot; The storm is estimated to have been the costliest tropical cyclone in <a href="History_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. history</a>.</p>
<p>The levee failures prompted investigations of their design and construction which belongs to the <a href="US_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> as mandated in the <a href="Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" title="wikilink">Flood Control Act of 1965</a> and into their maintenance by the local Levee Boards (who prevented the Army Corps from building flood gates at the mouth of the drainage canals at Lake Pontchartrain <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>). There was also an investigation of the responses from federal, state and local governments, resulting in the resignation of <a href="Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" title="wikilink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> director <a href="Michael_D._Brown" title="wikilink">Michael D. Brown</a>, and of New Orleans' Police Superintendent Eddie Compass.

<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>


<p>Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005 as the result of an interaction of a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> and the remains of <a href="Tropical_Depression_Ten_(2005)" title="wikilink">Tropical Depression Ten</a>. The system was upgraded to <a href="Tropical_cyclone#Intensity_classifications" title="wikilink">tropical storm status</a> on the morning of August 24 and at this point, the storm was given the name <em>Katrina.</em> The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> between <a href="Hallandale_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Hallandale Beach</a> and <a href="Aventura,_Florida" title="wikilink">Aventura, Florida</a> on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The storm <a href="rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">rapidly intensified</a> after entering the Gulf, growing from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours. This rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the &quot;unusually warm&quot; <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">waters</a> of the <a href="Loop_Current" title="wikilink">Loop Current</a>, which increased wind speeds.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On Saturday, August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>, becoming the third <a href="Tropical_cyclone#Categories_and_ranking" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a> of the season. An <a href="eyewall#Eyewall_replacement_cycles" title="wikilink">eyewall replacement cycle</a> disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category 5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1:00 p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) and a minimum central <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> of 902 <a href="Bar_(unit)" title="wikilink">mbar</a>. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes <a href="Hurricane_Rita" title="wikilink">Rita</a> and <a href="Hurricane_Wilma" title="wikilink">Wilma</a> later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by Rita).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> on Monday, August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) near <a href="Buras-Triumph,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Buras-Triumph, Louisiana</a>. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120 miles (190 km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920 mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and <a href="Breton_Sound" title="wikilink">Breton Sound</a>, it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120 mph (195 km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles (240 km) inland near <a href="Meridian,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Meridian, Mississippi</a>. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near <a href="Clarksville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a> region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a <a href="Surface_weather_analysis#cold_front" title="wikilink">frontal boundary</a>. The resulting <a href="extratropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>On the morning of Friday, August 26, at 10 a.m. <a href="Central_Daylight_Time" title="wikilink">CDT</a> (1500 <a href="UTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">UTC</a>), Katrina had strengthened to a Category 3 storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Later that afternoon, the NHC realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The NHC issued a hurricane watch for southeastern Louisiana, including the New Orleans area at 10 a.m. CDT Saturday, August 27.

<p>The <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> began prepositioning resources beyond the expected impact zone starting on August 26, and activated more than 400 reservists.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> All aircraft were returning back towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29.

<p><a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W.

<p>During video conferences involving the president on August 28 and 29, the director of the National Hurricane Center, <a href="Max_Mayfield" title="wikilink">Max Mayfield</a>, expressed concern that Katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls. In one conference, he stated, &quot;I do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not, but that's obviously a very, very great concern.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>On Sunday, August 28, as the sheer size of Katrina became clear, the NHC extended the tropical storm warning zone to cover most of the Louisiana coastline and a larger portion of the <a href="Florida_Panhandle" title="wikilink">Florida Panhandle</a>. The National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a <a href="National_Weather_Service_bulletin_for_New_Orleans_region" title="wikilink">vividly worded bulletin</a> predicting that the area would be &quot;uninhabitable for weeks&quot; after &quot;devastating damage&quot; caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of <a href="Hurricane_Camille" title="wikilink">Hurricane Camille</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> &quot;On Sunday, August 28, President Bush spoke with Governor Blanco to encourage her to order a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans.&quot; (Per page 235 of Special Report of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> )</p>
<p>Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast Louisiana as well as coastal Mississippi and Alabama.

<h4 id="investigation-of-state-of-emergency-declaration">Investigation of State of Emergency declaration</h4>
<p>In a September 26, 2005 hearing, former FEMA chief Michael Brown testified before a U.S. House subcommittee about FEMA's response. During that hearing, Representative <a href="Stephen_Buyer" title="wikilink">Stephen Buyer</a> (R-IN) inquired as to why President Bush's declaration of state of emergency of August 27 had not included the coastal parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and Plaquemines.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> (In fact, the declaration did not include <em>any</em> of Louisiana's coastal parishes, whereas the coastal counties were included in the declarations for Mississippi<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and Alabama.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>) Brown testified that this was because Louisiana <a href="Kathleen_Blanco" title="wikilink">Governor Blanco</a> had not included those parishes in her initial request for aid, a decision that he found &quot;shocking.&quot; After the hearing, Blanco released a copy of her letter, which showed she had requested assistance for &quot;all the southeastern parishes [but not by name] including the New Orleans Metropolitan area and the mid state Interstate I-49 corridor and northern parishes along the I-20 corridor that are accepting [evacuated citizens].&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Hurricane_Katrina_LA_landfall_radar.gif" title="fig:Radar image of Hurricane Katrina making landfall in Louisiana" alt="Radar image of Hurricane Katrina making landfall in Louisiana" /> On August 26, the state of Mississippi activated its <a href="United_States_National_Guard" title="wikilink">National Guard</a> in preparation for the storm's landfall. Additionally, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center the next day, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders. By 7:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern_Daylight_Time" title="wikilink">EDT</a> on August 28, 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning. Moreover, 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities, with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Louisiana's hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases, starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds. Persons in areas designated Phase II begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in Phase III areas (including New Orleans) evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Many private caregiving facilities that relied on bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges because they waited too long. Rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Some estimates claimed that 80% of the 1.3 million residents of the greater New Orleans metropolitan area evacuated, leaving behind substantially fewer people than remained in the city during the <a href="Hurricane_Ivan" title="wikilink">Hurricane Ivan</a> evacuation.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

Vertical scale exaggerated." alt="Vertical cross-section of New Orleans, showing maximum levee height of 23 feet (7 m). Vertical scale exaggerated." /> By August 26, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of Katrina  westward from the Florida Panhandle, putting the city of New Orleans directly in the center of their track probabilities; the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17%, with strike probability rising to 29% by August 28.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because some parts of New Orleans and the metro area are below sea level. Since the storm surge produced by the hurricane's right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was forecast to be 28 feet (8.5 m), emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city, causing major flooding.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>At a news conference at 10 a.m. on August 28, shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, New Orleans mayor <a href="Ray_Nagin" title="wikilink">Ray Nagin</a> ordered the first-ever <a href="emergency_evacuation" title="wikilink">mandatory evacuation</a> of the city, calling Katrina &quot;a storm that most of us have long feared.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The city government also established several &quot;refuges of last resort&quot; for citizens who could not leave the city, including the massive <a href="Louisiana_Superdome" title="wikilink">Louisiana Superdome</a>, which sheltered approximately 26,000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Many people living in the South Florida area were unaware when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern Florida near the <a href="Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami-Dade</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Broward_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Broward</a> county line.

However, National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted that Katrina would intensify to hurricane strength before landfall, and <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">hurricane watches and warnings</a> were issued 31.5 hours and 19.5 hours before landfall, respectively &lt;U+2014&gt; only slightly less than the target thresholds of 36 and 24 hours.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>On August 29, Katrina's <a href="storm_surge" title="wikilink">storm surge</a> caused 53 different levee breaches in greater New Orleans submerging eighty percent of the city. A June 2007 report by the <a href="American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> indicated that two-thirds of the flooding were caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Not mentioned were the flood gates that were not closed. The storm surge also devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, making Katrina the most destructive and costliest <a href="natural_disaster" title="wikilink">natural disaster</a> in the history of the United States, and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The total damage from Katrina is estimated at $81.2 billion (2005 <a href="U.S._dollars" title="wikilink">U.S. dollars</a>), nearly double the cost of the previously most expensive storm, <a href="Hurricane_Andrew" title="wikilink">Hurricane Andrew</a>, when adjusted for inflation.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

There were 14 fatalities reported in Florida as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Most of the <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Florida Keys</a> experienced tropical-storm force winds from Katrina as the storm's center passed to the north, with hurricane force winds reported in the <a href="Dry_Tortugas" title="wikilink">Dry Tortugas</a>. Rainfall was also high in the islands, with 10 inches (250 mm) falling on <a href="Key_West,_Florida" title="wikilink">Key West</a>. On August 26, a strong <a href="Fujita_scale" title="wikilink">F1</a> <a href="tornado" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornado</a> formed from an outer rain band of Katrina and struck <a href="Marathon,_Florida" title="wikilink">Marathon</a>.

<h3 id="louisiana">Louisiana</h3>
<p><img src="PostVeniceLG.jpg" title="fig:Flooding in Venice, Louisiana" alt="Flooding in Venice, Louisiana" /> On August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near <a href="Buras,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Buras, Louisiana</a> with 125 mph (205 km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in <a href="Plaquemines_Parish" title="wikilink">Plaquemines Parish</a> indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet (4.3 m) and a 12-foot (3 m) storm surge was recorded in <a href="Grand_Isle,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Grand Isle</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with 8 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 inches (200 &lt;U+2013&gt; 250 mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around <a href="Slidell,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Slidell</a>, the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches (380 mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of <a href="Lake_Pontchartrain" title="wikilink">Lake Pontchartrain</a> rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to <a href="Mandeville,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Mandeville</a>. Several bridges were destroyed, including the <a href="I-10_Twin_Span_Bridge" title="wikilink">I-10 Twin Span Bridge</a> connecting Slidell to New Orleans.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Almost 900,000 people in Louisiana lost power as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Hard-hit <a href="St._Bernard_Parish" title="wikilink">St. Bernard Parish</a> was flooded due to breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) and the breach of the Levee Board designed and built 40 Arpent canal levee. The search for the missing was undertaken by the St. Bernard Fire Department due to the assets of the <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> being diverted to New Orleans. According to an interview in the <em><a href="New_Orleans_Times-Picayune" title="wikilink">New Orleans Times-Picayune</a></em>, the coroner was still trying to get a list of missing from the <a href="Red_Cross" title="wikilink">Red Cross</a> in November 2005. While there were some victims on this list whose bodies were found in their homes, the vast majority were tracked down through word-of-mouth and credit card records. As of December 2005, the official missing list in the Parish stood at 47.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="new-orleans">New Orleans</h4>

<p><img src="KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded_edit2.jpg" title="fig:Flooded I-10/I-610/West End Blvd interchange and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana" alt="Flooded I-10/I-610/West End Blvd interchange and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana" /> As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or Category 2 strength.</p>
<p>Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro New Orleans and the failure of the 40 Arpent Canal levee. Failures occurred in New Orleans and surrounding communities, especially St. Bernard Parish. The <a href="Mississippi_River_Gulf_Outlet" title="wikilink">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</a> (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of east New Orleans, most of <a href="Saint_Bernard_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Saint Bernard Parish</a> and the East Bank of <a href="Plaquemines_Parish,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Plaquemines Parish</a>. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the <a href="17th_Street_Canal" title="wikilink">17th Street Canal</a> levee, the <a href="London_Avenue_Canal" title="wikilink">London Avenue Canal</a>, and the wide, navigable <a href="Industrial_Canal" title="wikilink">Industrial Canal</a>, which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged. The only routes out of the city were the westbound <a href="Crescent_City_Connection" title="wikilink">Crescent City Connection</a> and the Huey P. Long Bridge, as large portions of the I-10 Twin Span Bridge traveling eastbound towards Slidell, Louisiana had collapsed. Both the <a href="Lake_Pontchartrain_Causeway" title="wikilink">Lake Pontchartrain Causeway</a> and the Crescent City Connection only carried emergency traffic.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 29, at 7:40 a.m. CDT, it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the <a href="Hyatt_Regency_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">Hyatt Regency New Orleans</a> had been blown out, and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The <a href="Hyatt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyatt</a> was the most severely damaged hotel in the city, with beds reported to be flying out of the windows.

Two sections of the Superdome's roof were compromised and the dome's waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off. <a href="Louis_Armstrong_New_Orleans_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport</a> was closed before the storm but did not flood. On August 30, it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations. Limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on September 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early October.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Levee breaches in New Orleans also caused widespread loss of life, with over 700 bodies recovered in New Orleans by October 23, 2005.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in the east of the city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The first deaths reported from the city were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, as three <a href="nursing_home" title="wikilink">nursing home</a> patients died during an evacuation to <a href="Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Baton Rouge</a>, most likely from dehydration. While there were also early reports of fatalities amid mayhem at the Superdome, only six deaths were confirmed there, with four of these originating from natural causes, one from a drug overdose, and one a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered. One of the four is believed to be the result of a homicide.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>After making a brief initial landfall in Louisiana, Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast, causing a powerful 27-foot (8.2 m) storm surge, which penetrated 6 miles (10 km) inland in many areas and up to 12 miles (20 km) inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed <a href="Interstate_10" title="wikilink">Interstate 10</a> for several miles.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi, which caused significant tree damage throughout the state.

<p><img src="Hurricane_katrina_damage_gulfport_mississippi.jpg" title="fig:Damage to Long Beach, Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina" alt="Damage to Long Beach, Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina" /> The storm also brought heavy rains with 8 &lt;U+2013&gt; 10 inches (200 &lt;U+2013&gt; 250 mm) falling in southwestern Mississippi and rain in excess of 4 inches (100 mm) falling throughout the majority of the state. Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on August 29, some of which damaged trees and power lines.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled. Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90% of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and that storm surges traveled as much as six miles (10 km) inland in portions of the state's coast.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> One apartment complex with approximately thirty residents seeking shelter inside collapsed. More than half of the 13 casinos in the state, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of streets and bridges were washed away. On <a href="U.S._Highway_90" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 90</a> along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, two major bridges were completely destroyed: the Bay St. Louis - Pass Christian<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> bridge, and the Biloxi - <a href="Ocean_Springs,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Ocean Springs</a> bridge. In addition, the eastbound span of the I-10 bridge over the <a href="Pascagoula_River" title="wikilink">Pascagoula River</a> estuary was damaged. In the weeks after the storm, with the connectivity of the coastal U.S. Highway 90 shattered, traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced first to State Road 11 (parallel to I-10) then to two lanes on the remaining I-10 span when it was opened.</p>
<p><img src="Pascagoula_destroyed_condos_from_Katrina.jpg" title="fig:Surge damage in Pascagoula, Mississippi" alt="Surge damage in Pascagoula, Mississippi" /> All three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm. Katrina's surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of both <a href="Hancock_County,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Hancock</a>, <a href="Harrison_County,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Harrison</a>, and <a href="Jackson_County,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Jackson</a> Counties were inundated by the storm surge, in all three cases affecting most of the populated areas.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of <a href="Clermont_Harbor,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Clermont Harbor</a> and Waveland, much of Bay St. Louis, and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding Diamondhead and <a href="Kiln,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Kiln</a>. In Harrison County, <a href="Pass_Christian" title="wikilink">Pass Christian</a> was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders Back Bay. <a href="Biloxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biloxi</a>, on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river <a href="estuary" class="uri" title="wikilink">estuary</a>, with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and about  east of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and <a href="St._Martin,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">St. Martin</a> was hard hit; Ocean Springs, <a href="Moss_Point,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Moss Point</a>, Gautier, and <a href="Escatawpa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Escatawpa</a> also suffered major surge damage.</p>

<p>The economic effects of the storm were far-reaching. As of April 2006, the Bush Administration has sought $105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region,<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and this does not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the <a href="petroleum" title="wikilink">oil</a> supply, destruction of the Gulf Coast's highway infrastructure, and exports of commodities such as grain.

<p>Shortly after the hurricane moved away on August 30, 2005, some residents of New Orleans who remained in the city began <a href="looting" class="uri" title="wikilink">looting</a> stores.

<p>Within the United States and as delineated in the <a href="National_Response_Plan" title="wikilink">National Response Plan</a>, disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Some <a href="disaster_recovery" title="wikilink">disaster recovery</a> response to Katrina began before the storm, with <a href="Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a <a href="mortuary" class="uri" title="wikilink">mortuary</a> team with refrigerated trucks. A network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from New Orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall (even though many were directed to not enter the area), and continued for more than six months after the storm.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

To provide for additional housing, FEMA has also paid for the hotel costs of 12,000 individuals and families displaced by Katrina through February 7, 2006, when a final deadline was set for the end of hotel cost coverage. After this deadline, evacuees were still eligible to receive federal assistance, which could be used towards either apartment rent, additional hotel stays, or fixing their ruined homes, although FEMA no longer paid for hotels directly.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> As of early July 2006, there are still about 100,000 people living in 37,745 FEMA-provided trailers.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>Law enforcement and public safety agencies, from across the United States, provided a &quot;<a href="Mutual_aid_(emergency_services)" title="wikilink">mutual aid</a>&quot; response to Louisiana and New Orleans in the weeks following the disaster.

More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> The <a href="neologism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neologism</a> <em>Katrinagate</em> was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for &quot;2005 word of the year.&quot;<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

Deaths from <a href="thirst" class="uri" title="wikilink">thirst</a>, <a href="exhaustion" class="uri" title="wikilink">exhaustion</a>, and <a href="violence" class="uri" title="wikilink">violence</a>, days after the storm had passed, fueled the criticism, as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the Louisiana Superdome (designed to handle 800, yet 30,000 arrived)and the New Orleans Civic Center (not designed as an evacuation center, yet 25,000 arrived). Some alleged that <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">race</a>, <a href="social_class" title="wikilink">class</a>, and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. The percentage of black victims among storm-related deaths (49%)<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> was below their proportion in the area's population (approx. 60%<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> ).</p>
<p>In accordance with federal law, then-President George W. Bush directed the <a href="Secretary_of_Homeland_Security" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security</a>, Michael Chertoff, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael D. Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination, even though Governor Blanco resisted their efforts. Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral <a href="Thad_W._Allen" title="wikilink">Thad W.

<blockquote>
<p><em>I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the teacher-the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help &lt;U+2014&gt; with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way &lt;U+2014&gt; and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="Mike_Myers_(actor)" title="wikilink">Mike Myers</a>, with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script. Once it was his turn to speak again, West added, &quot;George Bush doesn't care about <a href="black_people" title="wikilink">black people</a>.&quot; Although the camera quickly cut away to <a href="Chris_Tucker" title="wikilink">Chris Tucker</a>, West's comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and were replayed and discussed afterwards.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state and governments headed by Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> sent an <a href="Israel_Defense_Forces" title="wikilink">IDF</a> delegation to New Orleans to transport aid equipment including 80 tons of food, disposable diapers, beds, blankets, generators and additional equipment which were donated from different governmental institutions, civilian institutions and the IDF.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The Bush Administration announced in mid-September that it did not need Israeli divers and physicians to come to the United States for search and rescue missions, but a small team landed in New Orleans on September 10 to give assistance to operations already under way. The team administered first aid to survivors, rescued abandoned pets and discovered hurricane victims.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Countries like <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>, which was still recovering from the Indian Ocean Tsunami, also offered to help.

<p>Despite receiving aid from around the world, there was also a heavy dose of criticism from around the world, including accusations of racism that were revealed at the international level across global press. Quotations from the UK Mirror such as &quot;Many things about the United States are wonderful, but it has a vile underbelly which is usually kept well out of sight.

These organizations raised US$4.25 billion in donations by the public, with the Red Cross receiving over half of the donations.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>Volunteers from <a href="amateur_radio" title="wikilink">amateur radio</a>'s emergency service wing, the <a href="Amateur_Radio_Emergency_Service" title="wikilink">Amateur Radio Emergency Service</a>, provided communications in areas where the communications infrastructure had been damaged or totally destroyed, relaying everything from 911 traffic to messages home.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> In Hancock County, Mississippi, ham radio operators provided the only communications into or out of the area, and even served as 911 dispatchers.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Many corporations also contributed to relief efforts. On September 13, 2005, it was reported that corporate donations to the relief effort were $409 million, and were expected to exceed $1 billion.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8 million overnight stays. None were allowed in New Orleans however. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had its Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families. Hurricane Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States in which the American Red Cross utilized its &quot;Safe and Well&quot; family location website.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a><a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>In the year following Katrina's strike on the Gulf Coast, The Salvation Army allocated donations of more than $365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state. The organization's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals served in and around New Orleans, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks &amp; drinks. Its SATERN network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. As part of the overall effort, Salvation Army officers, employees and volunteers contributed more than 900,000 hours of service.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="analysis-of-new-orleans-levee-failures">Analysis of New Orleans levee failures</h3>

<p><img src="Hurricane_Katrina_Eye_viewed_from_Hurricane_Hunter.jpg" title="fig:View of the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina taken on August 28, 2005, as seen from a NOAA WP-3D hurricane hunter aircraft before the storm made landfall on the United States Gulf Coast." alt="View of the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina taken on August 28, 2005, as seen from a NOAA WP-3D hurricane hunter aircraft before the storm made landfall on the United States Gulf Coast." /> A June 2007 report released by the <a href="American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> states that the failures of the locally built and federally funded levees in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The <a href="US_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> who by federal mandate is responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety. The Levee Boards had hamstrung the Army Corps.</p>
<p>According to new modeling and field observations by a team from <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">Louisiana State University</a>, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a 200-meter-wide (660-foot-wide) canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The <a href="Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">Army Corps of Engineers</a> disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The water flowing west from the storm surge was perpendicular to MRGO, and thus the canal had a negligible effect.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that &quot;We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> As the levee walls were mandated by the Levee Boards and were designed by local firms under the control of the Levee Boards, the Army Corps had little choice. The Army Corps had recommended 72 foot pilings be used, yet the Leveee Boards argued and prevailed that 24 foot pilings would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Various <a href="Conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy theories</a> began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished. A number of New Orleans residents described hearing &quot;explosions&quot; coming from the Industrial Canal levee in the <a href="Lower_9th_Ward" title="wikilink">Lower 9th Ward</a> before the floodwaters rushed in. A National Guard worker claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> The fracture of the wall due to a barge hitting it would also be an explanation of the loud noise heard.</p>
<p>Many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of Katrina. In reconstructing them, precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety. For example, in every situation possible, the Corps of Engineers replaced I-walls with T-walls. T-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>However, there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements. In February 2008, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5 billion of an estimated $7.2 billion for Army Corps of Engineers levee work, a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 2, 2008, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a speech to The National Press Club to request that President Bush free up money to complete work on Louisiana's levees. Bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget, but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill, which would pass sooner.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="media-involvement">Media involvement</h3>

<p><img src="Geraldo-Rivera-Katrina-Aftermath-FNC.jpg" title="fig:Geraldo Rivera reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on September 2, 2005." alt="Geraldo Rivera reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on September 2, 2005." /> Many representatives of the <a href="news_media" title="wikilink">news media</a> reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.</p>
<p>The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when <a href="Geraldo_Rivera" title="wikilink">Geraldo Rivera</a> of <a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a> tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the <a href="Ernest_N._Morial_Convention_Center" title="wikilink">Ernest N. Morial Convention Center</a>.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
<p>The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of <a href="Website" title="wikilink">Internet sites</a> - especially <a href="blogging" class="uri" title="wikilink">blogging</a> and community journalism. One example was the effort of <em>NOLA.com</em>, the web affiliate of New Orleans' <em><a href="The_Times-Picayune" title="wikilink">Times-Picayune</a></em>, which was awarded the Breaking News <a href="Pulitzer_Prize" title="wikilink">Pulitzer Prize</a>,<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based <em><a href="The_Sun_Herald" title="wikilink">Sun Herald</a></em>.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams - from individuals to the Coast Guard - which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p>The role of AM radio was of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news. <a href="AM_radio" title="wikilink">AM radio</a> provided emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina, radio station <a href="WWL-AM" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWL-AM</a> (New Orleans) was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. The 870 kHz frequency has a <a href="Clear-channel_stations" title="wikilink">clear channel</a> high power designation and the on-going nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to  away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their transmitter tower.</p>
<p>During the period of several weeks when most area radio stations were off the air, WWL-AM's emergency coverage was simulcast on the frequencies of other area radio stations. This emergency service was named &quot;<a href="United_Radio_Broadcasters_of_New_Orleans" title="wikilink">The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans</a>.&quot; To reach emergency radio operators in storm-ravaged areas, many of whom made their volunteer services available to the Red Cross and government entities, WWL-AM was simulcast on shortwave outlet <a href="WHRI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WHRI</a>, owned by World Harvest Radio International. The <a href="cellular_phone" title="wikilink">cellular phone</a> antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.</p>
<p>As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have &quot;zero access&quot; to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a <a href="lawsuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawsuit</a> and obtained a temporary <a href="restraining_order" title="wikilink">restraining order</a> against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina has also been the centerpiece of several documentary films, including <a href="Spike_Lee" title="wikilink">Spike Lee</a>'s film, <em><a href="When_the_Levees_Broke" title="wikilink">When the Levees Broke</a></em>, and <a href="Darren_Martinez" title="wikilink">Darren Martinez</a>'s film, <em>Hellp</em>.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> An episode of the Fox TV series <a href="House_(TV_Series)" title="wikilink">House</a> first broadcast on May 16, 2006, featured a teenage victim of Hurricane Katrina at the center of the <a href="Who&#39;s_Your_Daddy?_(House)" title="wikilink">main medical storyline</a>.</p>
<h3 id="retirement">Retirement</h3>

<p>Because of the large loss of life and property along the <a href="Gulf_Coast" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast</a>, the name Katrina was officially retired on April 6, 2006 by the <a href="World_Meteorological_Organization" title="wikilink">World Meteorological Organization</a> at the request of the U.S. government. It was replaced by Katia on List III of the <a href="Lists_of_tropical_cyclone_names#North_Atlantic" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane naming lists</a>, which will next be used in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
