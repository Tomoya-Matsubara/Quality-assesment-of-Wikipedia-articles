<h2 id="geography-and-climate">Geography and climate</h2>
<p>Chaozhou is located in the easternmost part of Guangdong Province, north of the coastal <a href="Shantou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shantou</a> City. It is situated in the north of the delta of the <a href="Han_River_(Guangdong)" title="wikilink">Han River</a> (&lt;U+97E9&gt;&lt;U+6C5F&gt;), which flows throughout the city.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 214 BC, Chaozhou was an undeveloped and named part of <a href="Nanhai_Commandery" title="wikilink">Nanhai</a> <a href="Commandery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Commandery</a> (&lt;U+5357&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+90E1&gt;) of the <a href="Qin_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Qin Dynasty</a>. In 331 during the <a href="Eastern_Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Eastern Han Dynasty</a> (&lt;U+6771&gt;&lt;U+6C49&gt;), <a href="Haiyang_District" title="wikilink">Haiyang</a> (&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+967D&gt;&lt;U+7E23&gt;) was established as a part of <a href="Dongguan_Commandery" title="wikilink">Dongguan Commandery</a> (&lt;U+6771&gt;&lt;U+5B98&gt;&lt;U+90E1&gt;).</p>
<p><a href="Dongguan_Commandery" title="wikilink">Dongguan Commandery</a> was renamed to <a href="Yi&#39;an_Commandery" title="wikilink">Yi'an Commandery</a> (&lt;U+7FA9&gt;&lt;U+5B89&gt;&lt;U+90E1&gt;) in 413. The commandery became a <a href="prefecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">prefecture</a> in 590 in the early <a href="Sui_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Sui Dynasty</a>; first as Xun Prefecture (&lt;U+5FAA&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, <em>Xunzhou</em>), then as Chao Prefecture (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;, <em>Chaozhou</em>) in the following year. In 1914, the <a href="Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">Republic of China</a> government combined Chao and Xun prefectures into Chaoxun Prefecture or Chaoxun <a href="Circuit_(political_division)" title="wikilink">Circuit</a> (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5FAA&gt;&lt;U+9053&gt;).</p>
<p>For a short while in the <a href="Sui_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Sui</a> and early <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang</a> Dynasties, <a href="Haiyang_District" title="wikilink">Haiyang District</a> was called <a href="Yi&#39;an_District" title="wikilink">Yi'an District</a> (&lt;U+7FA9&gt;&lt;U+5B89&gt;&lt;U+7E23&gt;). The name remained Haiyang until 1914, when it was renamed to <a href="Chao&#39;an_County" title="wikilink">Chao'an County</a> (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5B89&gt;&lt;U+7E23&gt;) to avoid ambiguity with the <a href="Haiyang_County" title="wikilink">Haiyang County</a> of <a href="Shandong_Province" title="wikilink">Shandong Province</a>.</p>
<p>The seat of the 1951 Guangdong People's Government was at Chao'an County, a part of it was created as Chao'an City in 1953 and later that year renamed to Chaozhou City (county-level). In 1955, the provincial seat moved to <a href="Shantou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shantou</a>. Chaozhou City was abolished five years later, and reestablished again in 1979. In 1983, the situation was reversed, with Chao'an abolished and made a part of Chaozhou City. Chaozhou was made a provincially-administered city in January 1989, and a <a href="vice-prefecture-level_city" title="wikilink">vice-prefecture-level city</a> in January 1990. In December 1991, Chaozhou was further upgraded into its current statue of <a href="prefecture-level_city" title="wikilink">prefecture-level city</a>.</p>
<p>Together, Chaozhou and the nearby cities of <a href="Shantou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shantou</a> (&lt;U+6C55&gt;&lt;U+5934&gt;) and <a href="Jieyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jieyang</a> (&lt;U+63ED&gt;&lt;U+9633&gt;) are called <a href="Chaoshan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaoshan</a>. The name was used for the joint political-administrative area which encompassed the three cities from 1958 until 1983. For the next five years, Shantou City was a higher-level city containing Chaozhou and Jieyang within it. Currently, Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang are equal in status.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>Chaozhou is famously known as one of the great cultural centres in the <a href="Lingnan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lingnan</a> region of China. Chaozhou culture is known worldwide as a unique part of world heritage. Down through history, the Chaozhou region, was able to flourish and thrive as a prosperous cultural centre enabling the nourishing of a unique and distinctive character epitomized in the <a href="Teochew_dialect" title="wikilink">Chaozhou Dialect</a>, Chaozhou opera, <a href="Chaozhou_cuisine" title="wikilink">Chaozhou cuisine</a>, Chaozhou Ganghu tea, Chaozhou music, Chaozhou lion dance and Chaozhou embroidery.</p>
<p><a href="Teochew_dialect" title="wikilink">Teochew dialect</a> (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+8A71&gt;), by which the Chaozhou culture conveys, is considered as one of the oldest Chinese dialects for it preserves many elegant and refined features from ancient Chinese that have been lost in some of the other modern dialects of Chinese. It is spoken by about 10 million people in local Chaozhou and approximately 2-5 million overseas. 30% of the Chinese in Vietnam speak this dialect. Teochew people are the second largest ethnic Chinese group in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, after the <a href="Hoklo" title="wikilink">Hokkien</a> - although <a href="Standard_Mandarin" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a> is gradually supplanting the Teochew topolect as the mother tongue for this group, especially among younger generations.</p>
<p><img src="Chaozhou_Opera-Menglikung.jpg" title="fig:Chaozhou Opera" alt="Chaozhou Opera" width="225" /> Chaozhou opera (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5287&gt;) is a traditional art form which has a history of more than 500 years and is now loved by 20 million Chaozhou natives in over 20 countries and regions. Based on the local folk dances and ballads, Chaozhou opera has formed its own style under the influence of <a href="Nanxi" title="wikilink">Nanxi Opera</a>. <a href="Nanxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanxi</a> is one of the oldest Chinese operas that originated in the <a href="Song_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Song Dynasty</a>. Its tunes are graceful and pleasant, full of local color. The old form of choral accompaniment still remains its special features. Clowns and females are the most distinctive characters in a Chaozhou opera, and fan-playing and acrobatic skills are more prominent than in other types of performances.</p>
<p><a href="Chinese_tea_ceremony" title="wikilink">Gongfu tea</a> (<a href="Chinese_tea_ceremony" title="wikilink">&lt;U+5DE5&gt;&lt;U+592B&gt;&lt;U+8336&gt;</a>), the 'espresso' of Chinese teas with a formidable kick, which was first sipped back in the <a href="Song_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Song Dynasty</a>, is still flourishing and remains an important part of social etiquette in Chaozhou. If you visit a family, you can be sure of at least one round of Ganghu tea. Though it tastes bitter when it first reaches your mouth, it is the lingering aftertaste that makes Ganghu tea probably the most charming tea culture in China. Drinking Ganghu tea is in fact a process of aesthetics rather than a solution to thirst.</p>
<p>At the local teahouse, tea service is often accompanied with Chaozhou music (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+97F3&gt;&lt;U+6A02&gt;). <a href="Chaozhou_xianshi" title="wikilink">String music</a>, the gong and drum music, the ancient music of set flutes are the traditional play forms of Chaozhou music. Chaozhou string music is made up of mostly plucked and bowed string instruments, and on some occasions, wind instruments are used. The most characteristic instruments are the <em>rihin</em> (&lt;U+4E8C&gt;&lt;U+5F26&gt;), <em><a href="Tihu_(instrument)" title="wikilink">tihu</a></em> (&lt;U+63D0&gt;&lt;U+80E1&gt;) and <em><a href="yehu" title="wikilink">yahu</a></em> (all two-stringed bowed lutes), the <em><a href="sanxian" class="uri" title="wikilink">sanxian</a></em>, <em><a href="pipa" class="uri" title="wikilink">pipa</a></em>, <em><a href="ruan" class="uri" title="wikilink">ruan</a></em>, <em><a href="guzheng" class="uri" title="wikilink">guzheng</a></em>, and <em><a href="yangqin" class="uri" title="wikilink">yangqin</a></em>. The number of instruments and performers in the ensemble is flexible and depends on the availability of instruments and musicians to play them - but to have an even and balanced texture only one of each instrument is preferred. Chaozhou drum music includes the big drum and gong, the small drum and gong, the dizi set drum and dong and su drum and gong ensembles. The current Chaozhou drum music is said to be similar to the form of the Drum and Wind Music of the Han and Tang Dynasties. The Chaozhou <em><a href="guzheng" class="uri" title="wikilink">guzheng</a></em> (&lt;U+6F6E&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+53E4&gt;&lt;U+7B5D&gt;) is also regarded as a major member of the southern guzheng family.</p>

The lighthouse was used for boats in the Hanjiang river as this part of the river was dangerous. The lighthouse could remind people that they were in Chaozhou area and ought to be careful. It is said a former emperor once passed in his &quot;dragon boat&quot; while he was sleeping and was woken by the light from this Lighthouse. He thought it must have been a bodhisattva sending him the light and therefore named it the &quot;lighthouse of Buddha&quot;.</li>

<li>The Chaozhou people form the second largest group amongst the ethnic Chinese in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, after the <a href="Hokkien" title="wikilink">Hokkiens</a>, comprising 21% of <a href="Chinese_Singaporean" title="wikilink">Chinese Singaporeans</a>. Teochew was originally the dominant language amongst the Chinese immigrants in Singapore, until it was superseded by the Hokkiens due to later immigration flows. Concentrations of Chaozhou people once settled along the banks of the <a href="Singapore_River" title="wikilink">Singapore River</a> as well as the <a href="Straits_of_Johor" title="wikilink">Straits of Johor</a>, until urban development and the redistribution of the people in <a href="public_housing_in_Singapore" title="wikilink">public housing development</a> diluted this geographic trend, although they are still known to concentrate in the northeast such as in <a href="Hougang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hougang</a>. Traditional commercial sectors of Chinatown once dominated by Teochews include Circular Road and South Bridge Road. Chaozhou peoples also founded rural settlements and were active in the plantation industry, and gave rise to modern place names such as <a href="Choa_Chu_Kang" title="wikilink">Choa Chu Kang</a>, <a href="Lim_Chu_Kang" title="wikilink">Lim Chu Kang</a> and <a href="Yio_Chu_Kang" title="wikilink">Yio Chu Kang</a>.

<li>There is also a large number of Teochew people in <a href="Penang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penang</a>, <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>. In the early 19th century some Teochew people settled here and in 1855, they founded the Teochew Association, which also includes a temple in Chulia Street, <a href="George_Town,_Penang" title="wikilink">George Town</a>. The community continued to grow until in 1919, a school named after the <a href="Han_River" title="wikilink">Han River</a>, <a href="Han_Chiang_School" title="wikilink">Han Chiang School</a>, was founded to provide education for the people.

<li>There is a large population of Chaozhou people in <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>. When mainland China opened its gate in the 1950s, there was an exodus of refugees into Hong Kong to flee the communist rule. Refugees from Chaozhou banded together in very tight communities. They were known to be very generous of helping refugees from their own regions. They spoke their own Teochew dialect amongst themselves, hence they stood out among the locals when almost everybody else spoke Cantonese in Hong Kong. The locals called them by the name &quot;Chiu Chow Loun&quot;, where Chiu Chow is the Cantonese pronunciation of their origin, Teo Chew and Nang is the Teochew pronunciation of the word &quot;people&quot;. They were known to be a very hardworking people and they were good at running small businesses. Back in the 1960s, almost every &quot;rice store&quot; (grocery stores for dried food and uncooked rice) in Hong Kong were owned by &quot;Chiu Chow Loun&quot;. Decades and generations later, the offspring of these immigrants blended into the rest of the communities. Large corporation run supermarkets drove many &quot;rice stores&quot; out of business. Chiu Chow Loun no longer as stood out as special communities in Hong Kong, though they are still very active in organizing charity activities, especially around the &quot;ghost festival&quot; in the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. See <a href="Teochew_people" title="wikilink">Teochew people</a> for more details.</li>
