<p>Born in <a href="Auckland,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Auckland, New Zealand</a>, the son of Croatian-born Ivan Gareljich, Garea began training at the Mt. Roskill gymnasium with &quot;Wild&quot; Don Scott<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in English-style <a href="catch-as-catch-can_wrestling" title="wikilink">catch-as-catch-can wrestling</a> and made his pro wrestling debut in 1970, a year before his older brother <a href="Tony_Garea" title="wikilink">Tony Garea</a>.
