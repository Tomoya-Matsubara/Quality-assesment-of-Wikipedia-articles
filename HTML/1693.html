Palmer, 1942." /> The <strong>United States Office of War Information (OWI)</strong> was a <a href="USA" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> <a href="U.S._government" title="wikilink">government</a> agency created during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and, using <a href="poster" title="wikilink">posters</a> and <a href="radio_broadcast" title="wikilink">radio broadcasts</a>, worked to promote patriotism, warned about foreign spies and attempted to recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch which launched a large scale information and <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a> campaign abroad.</p>
<h2 id="establishment">Establishment</h2>
<p>The OWI was established by <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=16273">Executive Order 9182</a> on June 13, 1942, to consolidate the functions of the Office of Facts and Figures, OWI's direct predecessor; the Office of Government Reports, and the division of information of the Office for Emergency Management. The Foreign Intelligence Service, Outpost, Publication, and Pictorial Branches of the <a href="Office_of_the_Coordinator_of_Information" title="wikilink">Office of the Coordinator of Information</a> were also transferred to the OWI. (The Executive order creating OWI, however, stated that dissemination of information to the Latin American countries should be continued by the Office of the <a href="Coordinator_of_Inter-American_Affairs" title="wikilink">Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs</a>.) <a href="Elmer_Davis" title="wikilink">Elmer Davis</a>, who was a CBS newsman, was named director of OWI.</p>
<p>Among its wide-ranging responsibilities, OWI sought to review and approve the design and content of government posters. OWI officials felt that the most urgent problem on the home front was the careless leaking of sensitive information that could be picked up by spies and saboteurs. <img src="M-4_tank_crews_of_the_United_States,_Ft_Knox,_Ky.jpg" title="fig:M-4 tank crew. OWI photo, 1942." alt="M-4 tank crew. OWI photo, 1942." /> OWI directly produced radio series such as <em>This is Our Enemy</em> (spring 1942), which dealt with Germany, Japan, and Italy; <em>Uncle Sam</em>, which dealt with domestic themes; and <em>Hasten the Day</em> (August 1943), which was about the Home Front. In addition, OWI cleared commercial network scripts through its Domestic Radio Bureau, including the NBC Blue Network's <em>Chaplain Jim</em>. In addition, radio producer <a href="Norman_Corwin" title="wikilink">Norman Corwin</a> produced several series for OWI, including <em>An American in England</em>, <em>An American in Russia</em>, and <em>Passport for Adams</em>, which starred actor <a href="Robert_Young_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Young</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the OWI produced a series of 267 newsreels in 16 mm film, <em>The United Newsreel</em> which were shown overseas and to U.S. audiences. These newsreels incorporated U.S. military footage. Examples can be seen at <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=owner%3Anara+type%3Aworld_war_II&amp;so=0">this Google list</a>.</p>
<p>OWI also established the <a href="Voice_of_America" title="wikilink">Voice of America</a> in 1942, which remains in service today as the official government broadcasting service of the United States. The VOA's initial transmitters were loaned from the commercial networks, and among the programs OWI produced were those provided by the Labor Short Wave Bureau, whose material came from the <a href="American_Federation_of_Labor" title="wikilink">American Federation of Labor</a> and the <a href="Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations" title="wikilink">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a>. <img src="A-20_Havoc.jpg" title="fig:Servicing a Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber. OWI photo, 1942." alt="Servicing a Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber. OWI photo, 1942." /> During 1942 and 1943, the OWI contained two photographic units whose photographers documented the country's mobilization during the early years of the war, concentrating on such topics as aircraft factories and women in the workforce.</p>
<p>The Foreign Moral Analysis division of Pacific affairs, under the leadership of <a href="George_E._Taylor" title="wikilink">George E. Taylor</a> commissioned a series of studies designed to help policymakers' understanding of enemy psychology. Among these studies were <a href="The_Chrysanthemum_and_the_Sword" title="wikilink">The Chrysanthemum and the Sword</a> by <a href="Ruth_Benedict" title="wikilink">Ruth Benedict</a> and <a href="John_Embree" title="wikilink">John Embree</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em>The Japanese Nation: A Social Survey</em> (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1945).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

OWI photo by Howard R. Hollem, 1942." alt="Aviation Ordnanceman stationed at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi installing a M1919 Browning machine gun. OWI photo by Howard R. Hollem, 1942." /> Many of these people were active supporters of President Roosevelt's <a href="New_Deal" title="wikilink">New Deal</a> and extolled the President's policies in producing radio programs such as <em>This is War</em>, which irritated Congressional opponents of such programs. In addition, many of the writers, producers, and actors of OWI programs admired the Soviet Union and were either loosely affiliated with or were members of the <a href="Communist_Party_USA" title="wikilink">Communist Party USA</a>. The director of Pacific operations for the OWI, Owen Lattimore, who later accompanied U.S. Vice-President <a href="Henry_Wallace" title="wikilink">Henry Wallace</a> on a mission to China and Mongolia in 1944, was later alleged to be a Soviet agent on the basis of testimony by a defector from the Soviet <a href="GRU" class="uri" title="wikilink">GRU</a>, General <a href="Alexander_Barmine" title="wikilink">Alexander Barmine</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In his final report, Elmer Davis noted that he had fired 35 employees, because of past Communist associations, though the <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">FBI</a> files showed no formal allegiance to the CPUSA.</p>
<h2 id="soviet-spy">Soviet Spy</h2>
<p><a href="Flora_Wovschin" title="wikilink">Flora Wovschin</a> was later revealed to have been a Soviet spy. At <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a>, where the list of communist spies included her mother and stepfather, she met <a href="Marion_Davis_Berdecio" title="wikilink">Marion Davis Berdecio</a> and <a href="Judith_Coplon" title="wikilink">Judith Coplon</a>, both of whom Wovschin recruited into service for the Soviet <a href="NKVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">NKVD</a> spy agency. After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, she renounced her U.S. citizenship and lived in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id="opposition-and-termination">Opposition and Termination</h2>
<p>Congressional opposition to the domestic operations of the OWI resulted in increasingly curtailed funds. In 1943, the OWI's appropriations were cut out of the fiscal year 1944 budget and only restored with strict restrictions on what OWI could do domestically. Many branch offices were closed and the Motion Picture Bureau was closed down. By 1944 the OWI operated mostly in the foreign field, contributing to undermining enemy morale. The agency was abolished in 1945, and its foreign functions were transferred to the <a href="United_States_Department_of_State" title="wikilink">Department of State</a>.</p>
<p>The OWI was terminated, effective September 15, 1945, by an executive order of August 31, 1945.</p>
