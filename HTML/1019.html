<p><strong>James Howard &quot;Jim&quot; Thome</strong> (;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> born August 27, 1970) is an American <a href="professional_baseball" title="wikilink">professional baseball</a> <a href="designated_hitter" title="wikilink">designated hitter</a> and <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first baseman</a> who is currently a free agent in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball (MLB)</a>. A five-time <a href="MLB_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">MLB All-Star</a>, he has played for the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;2002, 2011), <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2005, 2012), <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a> (2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2009), <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (2009), <a href="Minnesota_Twins" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a> (2010&lt;U+2013&gt;2011) and <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> (2012).</p>
<p>In 1996 he won the <a href="Silver_Slugger_Award" title="wikilink">Silver Slugger Award</a> and in 2006 the <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Comeback Player of the Year Award</a>.

<p>Thome was part of a Cleveland Indians core which led the franchise to two <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. The group went to two World Series, but lost both. In <a href="1995_World_Series" title="wikilink">1995</a>, they lost to the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> in six games while in <a href="1997_World_Series" title="wikilink">1997</a> they lost to the young <a href="Florida_Marlins" title="wikilink">Florida Marlins</a> franchise in seven games. His trademarks include his high socks, which he helped make popular again in the mid-'90s, a time when players wore their pant cuffs down around their ankles; his batting stance, during which he holds the bat out with his right hand and points it at right field before the pitcher comes set; and his consistent positive attitude.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Thome was born in <a href="Peoria,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Peoria</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> on August 27, 1970, just minutes after twin sister Jenny. The youngest of five children, Thome was born into an athletic family. His grandmother was hired at <a href="Caterpillar_Inc." title="wikilink">Caterpillar</a> so she could play for the company softball team. His father also played softball in a circuit known as the Outlaw League, occasionally for pay. Thome's two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at <a href="Limestone_Community_High_School_District_310" title="wikilink">Limestone High School</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Like his brothers, Thome also attended Limestone.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was all-state in both baseball and basketball.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> While at Limestone, Thome played shortstop. He had hoped to be noticed by scouts, but at his relatively small frame ( ), he attracted only passing interest. He graduated in 1988. After not being drafted in 1988, Thome enrolled at <a href="Illinois_Central_College" title="wikilink">Illinois Central College</a> and continued both his baseball and basketball careers.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He played one season at Illinois Central before being drafted by the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> in 1989.</p>

<h3 id="cleveland-indians-1991u20132002">Cleveland Indians (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;2002)</h3>
<p>Thome was drafted by Cleveland in the 13th round of the <a href="1989_Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">1989 Major League Baseball Draft</a>. He was originally assigned to the Indians' <a href="Gulf_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast League</a> squad, where he played exclusively in 1989 posting a stat line of .237 with no home runs and 22 RBIs.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During his first summer with Cleveland, he first met mentor and later manager <a href="Charlie_Manuel" title="wikilink">Charlie Manuel</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1990, he combined to hit .340 with 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the Rookie and A levels. After splitting the majority of the 1991 season between AA and AAA where he combined to hit .319 with seven home runs and 73 RBIs, Thome made his Major League debut on September 4, 1991 as a <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third baseman</a> against the <a href="Minnesota_Twins" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a>. In the game he went 2-for-4 and recorded his first hit off pitcher <a href="Tom_Edens" title="wikilink">Tom Edens</a> in the fourth inning. He hit his first career home run on October 4 against <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> pitcher <a href="Steve_Farr" title="wikilink">Steve Farr</a>.</p>
<p>Thome had an injury-riddled 1992 campaign in which he played for both the Indians and the <a href="Colorado_Springs_Sky_Sox" title="wikilink">Colorado Springs Sky Sox</a>, the Indians' AAA affiliate at the time. He combined to play 52 games with four home runs and 26 RBIs while hitting .236.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Thome played mostly for the <a href="Charlotte_Knights" title="wikilink">Charlotte Knights</a>, the Indians' new AAA affiliate, in 1993. He hit .332 with 102 RBIs, both of which led the <a href="International_League" title="wikilink">International League</a>. He also hit 25 home runs. This performance earned him a late season call up in which he hit .266 with seven home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1994 offseason, Cleveland made several offseason acquisitions in an attempt to compete after six consecutive sub-.500 seasons. <a href="Sandy_Alomar_Jr." title="wikilink">Sandy Alomar Jr.</a>, <a href="Kenny_Lofton" title="wikilink">Kenny Lofton</a>, <a href="Carlos_Baerga" title="wikilink">Carlos Baerga</a>, and <a href="Mark_Clark_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Mark Clark</a> were brought in to work with Thome and 22 year old <a href="Manny_Ramirez" title="wikilink">Manny Ramirez</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> For the first time in his career, Thome spent the entire year with Cleveland playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs. His salary was $325,000. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This group led the Indians to within one game of the <a href="1994_Minnesota_Twins_season" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a>' <a href="American_League_Central" title="wikilink">American League Central</a> lead and a <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card" title="wikilink">wild card</a> spot prior to the <a href="1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95_Major_League_Baseball_strike" title="wikilink">the 1994 players' strike</a>. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite Thome's statistical improvement in 1994, it was not until  that the Indians' success led to a playoff berth. Thome led the team by hitting .314 with 25 home runs and 73 RBIs. The Indians went 100&lt;U+2013&gt;44 to win the American League Central, though they eventually lost the World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games, who had won ten fewer games in the regular season.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Thome hit .211 in the World Series with one home run and two RBIs.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>He then hit 38 home runs in 1996, once hitting a 511-foot (156-m) shot at Cleveland's <a href="Jacobs_Field" title="wikilink">Jacobs Field</a>. It is the longest home run ever recorded at a Cleveland ballpark.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally a third baseman, he was shifted to first base when the Indians traded for <a href="Matt_Williams_(third_baseman)" title="wikilink">Matt Williams</a> in 1997.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In 1997, Thome helped the Indians connect for a club record 220 home runs by contributing 40 of them to go along with 33 from <a href="David_Justice" title="wikilink">David Justice</a> and 32 from Williams. Thome also totaled an AL high 120 <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a> to go along with 102 RBIs. Cleveland returned to the <a href="1997_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> that year behind their record offense, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The next three seasons would not achieve the same level of success for either Thome or the Indians as the previous three had. On July 14, 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of the season while helping the Indians snap the Yankees' 10 game winning streak.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On August 8, Thome broke a bone in his right hand and spent five weeks on the disabled list.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a .293 batting average. In Game 3 of the <a href="1998_American_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">American League Championship Series</a> against the New York Yankees, he hit two home runs off of <a href="Andy_Pettitte" title="wikilink">Andy Pettitte</a> enroute to a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;1 Cleveland victory.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Cleveland would, however, subsequently lose the series to the Yankees.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1999, in a rematch of the prior year's ALCS, Thome hit a grand slam against the Yankees off of <a href="Orlando_Hernandez" title="wikilink">Orlando Hernandez</a>, which powered Cleveland to a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In total, he regressed in batting average, falling to .277, but improved both his home run and RBI totals by posting 33 and 108 respectively. In the <a href="1999_American_League_Division_Series" title="wikilink">ALDS</a> game one, Thome hit a two-run home run off of <a href="Derek_Lowe" title="wikilink">Derek Lowe</a> to tie the game, in which Cleveland would go on to defeat the <a href="1999_Boston_Red_Sox_season" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a> 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After going up in the series two games to none, however, Cleveland ended up losing 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 to Boston.</p>
<p>The 2000 season would prove to be a statistical regression for Thome. On June 21, Thome hit his 20th home run of the year against the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a>. This marked the seventh consecutive season in which Thome hit 20 or more home runs.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On September 29, while in the midst of a tight race for the wildcard spot, Thome led the Indians to a victory against the <a href="2000_Toronto_Blue_Jays_season" title="wikilink">Toronto Blue Jays</a> by hitting a two-run home run to lead the Indians to an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;4 victory. After the game, Thome was quoted as saying, &quot;This team has battled all year, so this was nothing new. Here we are, and we're here tomorrow to play another day.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Despite finishing 90&lt;U+2013&gt;72, the Indians missed the playoffs.

<p>For the 2001 season, he finished second in the American League with 49 home runs. In addition, Thome had 124 RBIs and 111 walks.

<p><img src="Thome_Phillies.jpg" title="fig:Thome in 2005" alt="Thome in 2005" width="250" /> Thome missed a significant portion of the first half of the 2005 season,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> where he hit only .207 with seven home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break.

<p>Though the emergence of Howard made Thome less important to the squad, another primary factor to his shipment to Chicago was his family situation. His mother had died a year earlier and the fact that his father's condition was getting worse.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Phillies and White Sox completed the deal on November 25, 2005, only days after new GM Pat Gillick took the reins of the team, Thome was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with $22 million.

He set the team record for most home runs in the month of April (10), beating <a href="Frank_Thomas_(baseball,_born_1968)" title="wikilink">Frank Thomas</a>'s record by one. He also set a major league record by scoring in each of the White Sox's first 17 games.

On June 19, Thome returned to his former team, the Phillies, and hit a pinch hit game winning home run in the 11th inning off of <a href="Danys_Baez" title="wikilink">Danys Baez</a>. The Twins won the game 13&lt;U+2013&gt;10.</p>
<p>On July 3, Thome hit his 573rd and 574th home runs. In doing so he displaced fellow Twins player <a href="Harmon_Killebrew" title="wikilink">Harmon Killebrew</a> for number 10 on the all-time home run leaders list. The game was stopped and the Twins played a pre-recorded message from Killebrew congratulating Thome on the accomplishment during which he said, &quot;I'm glad he was able to hit it in a Twins uniform. I only wish I could have been there to see it.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Thome hit the first <a href="walk-off" class="uri" title="wikilink">walk-off</a> hit in Target Field on August 17, a 445-foot two-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning against the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a>. It was the 12th walk-off home run of his career, tying him for first all time (with <a href="Jimmie_Foxx" title="wikilink">Jimmie Foxx</a>, <a href="Mickey_Mantle" title="wikilink">Mickey Mantle</a>, <a href="Stan_Musial" title="wikilink">Stan Musial</a>, <a href="Frank_Robinson" title="wikilink">Frank Robinson</a>, and <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a>). On September 4, Thome again hit two home runs in a single game to tie and then pass <a href="Mark_McGwire" title="wikilink">Mark McGwire</a> for the ninth spot on the career home run list. Thome passed Robinson on September 11, when he hit his 587th career home run in the top of the 12th inning in Cleveland.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>He finished the 2010 season with a .283 average, 25 home runs and 59 RBIs.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Statistically, in terms of power measurements such as slugging percentage and at bats per home run, it was the best season for Thome since 2002.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>On January 14, 2011, Thome accepted a one-year, $3 million contract with incentives to continue playing for the Twins. Thome hit the longest home run ever at Target Field, a 490-foot shot into the upper deck in right-center field, on July 17.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> He hit his 599th and 600th career home runs (in two straight at bats) at <a href="Comerica_Park" title="wikilink">Comerica Park</a> on August 15.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> This made him only the eighth player to have achieved the feat.</p>
<h3 id="second-stint-with-cleveland-2011">Second stint with Cleveland (2011)</h3>
<p>On August 25, 2011, Thome was traded to the Cleveland Indians, for a player to be named later or cash, after being claimed off waivers a day before.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> On September 18, it was announced that Minnesota had received $20,000 for Thome.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> On September 23, the team held a ceremony honoring Thome, including the unveiling of plans for a statue of him in Heritage Park. In that game, Thome hit a home run that landed near the proposed location for his statue. He received a curtain call from the crowd. <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Through 2011, Thome was second among all active major leaguers in home runs (604; behind Rodriguez) and RBIs (1,674; Rodriguez), and fifth in career slugging percentage (.556; behind <a href="Albert_Pujols" title="wikilink">Albert Pujols</a>, Rodriguez, <a href="Ryan_Braun" title="wikilink">Ryan Braun</a>, and Howard).<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Thome is the Indians' all-time leader in home runs (337), walks (1,008), and strikeouts (1,400).<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Jim_Thome_on_June_9,_2012.jpg" title="fig:Thome during his second stint with the Phillies in 2012" alt="Thome during his second stint with the Phillies in 2012" /> On November 4, 2011, Thome agreed to a one year, $1.25 million deal with the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. He mentioned in his news conference that coming back to Philadelphia was a &quot;no-brainer&quot;. He also mentioned that, in light of the Achilles injury to Ryan Howard, he would &quot;spend the offseason preparing himself to play first base once or twice a week&quot;, despite not playing in the field since 2007. He started his first game at first base on April 8, 2012, where he started a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;6&lt;U+2013&gt;3 double play. <a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Thome experienced stiffness in his lower back in a game against the Chicago Cubs on April 28, and did not finish the game.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In May, he was placed by the Phillies on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Thome was only batting .100 at the time.</p>
<p>Thome returned to the club in early June, and prepped for <a href="Interleague_Play" title="wikilink">Interleague Play</a> against the <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> as the DH. He went 3-for-5 with an RBI in his first game after returning, and hit a home run in the following game. Thome finished the nine-game interleague road trip with four home runs and 14 RBIs.</p>
<p>On June 17, Thome became the fourth major league player, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Alex Rodriguez, to hit 100 home runs with three different teams. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off home run in the ninth inning off of <a href="Jake_McGee" title="wikilink">Jake McGee</a> to beat the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Rays" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Rays</a> 7&lt;U+2013&gt;6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying <a href="Sammy_Sosa" title="wikilink">Sammy Sosa</a> for seventh all time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The home run was also the first pinch-hit home run of Thome's career.</p>
<p>Thome's last game as a Phillie was in an afternoon loss to the <a href="Miami_Marlins" title="wikilink">Miami Marlins</a> on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Ryan Howard's return from the disabled list), it was officially announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.</p>
<h3 id="baltimore-orioles-2012">Baltimore Orioles (2012)</h3>
<p>Thome was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a pair of minor league players, pitcher <a href="Kyle_Simon" title="wikilink">Kyle Simon</a> and catcher <a href="Gabriel_Lino" title="wikilink">Gabriel Lino</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The Orioles cited the need for Thome's veteran experience on a playoff bound team as a primary factor to acquiring him.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> He got his first hit, a single, against the <a href="Seattle_Mariners" title="wikilink">Seattle Mariners</a> on July 2. <a href="Matt_Wieters" title="wikilink">Matt Wieters</a>, Orioles <a href="Catcher_(baseball)" title="wikilink">catcher</a>, said of Thome: &quot;I think you look at him and say: This is a guy who loves the game more than anyone. He's the first guy to the park, the first guy to the weight room, the first guy hitting.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Thome hit his first home run with the Orioles on July 20 against his former team, the Cleveland Indians, at <a href="Progressive_Field" title="wikilink">Progressive Field</a>.

<p>After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, &quot;There's a lot memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Orioles teammates have remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, &quot;I talk the game. When I set in the dugout during games I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to <a href="Eddie_Murray" title="wikilink">Eddie Murray</a> when he was in his 40's.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The Orioles did make the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees.

<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Thome and his wife, Andrea, have two children, Lila Grace and Landon.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Thome has also established funding to put his 10 nieces and nephews through college.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Thome lives in Peoria, Illinois during the offseason.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>It was reported on <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a>'s <a href="SportsCenter" class="uri" title="wikilink">SportsCenter</a> that shortly after his nephew, Brandon, was paralyzed in an accident, he asked Thome to hit a home run for him; Thome granted the request by hitting two in the subsequent game. In a 2007 poll of 464 Major League Baseball players, Thome tied for second friendliest player with <a href="Mike_Sweeney" title="wikilink">Mike Sweeney</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
