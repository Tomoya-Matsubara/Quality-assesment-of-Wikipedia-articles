<p><strong>Millennium '73</strong> was a three-day festival held on November 8&lt;U+2013&gt;10, 1973 at the <a href="Astrodome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astrodome</a> in <a href="Houston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Houston</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, United States, by the <a href="Divine_Light_Mission" title="wikilink">Divine Light Mission</a> (DLM). It featured <a href="Prem_Rawat" title="wikilink">Prem Rawat</a>, then known as Guru Maharaj Ji, a 15-year-old <a href="guru" class="uri" title="wikilink">guru</a> and the leader of a fast-growing <a href="new_religious_movement" title="wikilink">new religious movement</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Organizers billed the festival as the most significant event in <a href="human_history" title="wikilink">human history</a> which would usher in a thousand years of <a href="peace" class="uri" title="wikilink">peace</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The festival's official schedule described the three evening addresses by Guru Maharaj Ji as the highlights of the event.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Big-band" class="uri" title="wikilink">Big-band</a> music, <a href="rock_bands" title="wikilink">rock bands</a>, religious songs, <a href="choral" class="uri" title="wikilink">choral</a> works, a dance performance and speeches by other DLM leaders filled the program from noon to 10 pm. Media events included press conferences and an impromptu debate.</p>
<p>Millennium '73 received wide publicity. <a href="Rennie_Davis" title="wikilink">Rennie Davis</a>, a prominent <a href="anti-war_movement" title="wikilink">anti-war activist</a> and member of the <a href="Chicago_Seven" title="wikilink">Chicago Seven</a>, helped draw attention to the event as a spokesman for the DLM. Notable journalists attended, some of them acquaintances of Davis from the <a href="New_Left" title="wikilink">New Left</a>. It was later described by some scholars and journalists as among the major events of 1973 and the 1970s, the high point of Guru Maharaj Ji's popularity, and the most important development in the American DLM's history.</p>
<p>Attendance was estimated from 10,000 to 35,000, compared to the projected 100,000. Many scholars and journalists generally depicted the event as a disappointment. That, along with other factors including a large debt, led to changes in the DLM's structure, management and message. The following year the movement split into branches headed by Maharaj Ji in the West, and his mother and brother <a href="Satpal_Maharaj" title="wikilink">Bal Bhagwan Ji</a> in India.</p>

Hans Ji, called &quot;Guru Maharaj Ji&quot;, died six years later and was succeeded as spiritual leader and Perfect Master by his eight-year old youngest son, who adopted his father's title. As the young Guru Maharaj Ji was a minor, his mother, Mata Ji, and the eldest son, Bal Bhagwan Ji, managed the DLM's affairs.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By 1971, when the 13-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji made his first tours of the United Kingdom and United States, the Indian DLM claimed over five million members (known as &quot;premies&quot;).

<p>The DLM celebrated three annual festivals, the largest of which, &quot;Hans Jayanti&quot;, commemorated Hans Ji Maharaj's birthday on November 9.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Hans Jayanti festivals held in India in the early 1970s were well-attended, attracting audiences of up to a million people, including Westerners.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Mata Ji and the 22-year-old Bal Bhagwan Ji decided that the 1973 Hans Jayanti should be held in the United States; it was the first to be held outside India.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many people in the US, especially <a href="hippie" title="wikilink">hippies</a>, believed that the world was on the verge of a new era, the <a href="Age_of_Aquarius" title="wikilink">Age of Aquarius</a>. This new age was expected to be characterized by peace and love, harmony and understanding.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> By the late autumn of 1973 there was an &quot;apocalyptic chill in the air&quot;, as headlines dealt with the <a href="Vietnam_war" title="wikilink">Vietnam war</a>, the <a href="Watergate_scandal" title="wikilink">Watergate scandal</a>, the <a href="Spiro_Agnew" title="wikilink">Agnew</a> resignation, <a href="Yom_Kippur_War" title="wikilink">a war in the Middle East</a>, <a href="1973_oil_crisis" title="wikilink">an energy crisis</a>, mass murders in Houston and California, and <a href="UFO_sightings" title="wikilink">UFO sightings</a> across the South.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Sociologist <a href="James_V._Downton" title="wikilink">James V. Downton</a> wrote that the <a href="millenarianism" title="wikilink">millenarian</a> appeal of the DLM prior to the festival sprang from a belief that Guru Maharaj Ji was the Lord, and that a new age of peace would begin under his leadership. These hopes appealed to the <a href="Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="wikilink">counterculture youth</a> of the time, who were disillusioned with earlier attempts at political and cultural revolution and who were turning their aspirations in a spiritual direction. Downton describes these aspirations as encouraging millennial beliefs within the DLM, including the &quot;psychological trappings of surrender and idealization.&quot; He states the guru's mother, whose <em><a href="satsang" class="uri" title="wikilink">satsang</a></em> was &quot;full of references to his divine nature&quot;, aided these beliefs, as did the guru himself, &quot;for letting others cast him in the role of the Lord.&quot; Maharaj Ji's appeal to followers to give up beliefs and concepts did not prevent them &quot;from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity and the coming of a new age.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In a meeting with members, DLM President Bob Mishler denied that the event would start the millennium and said they called it &quot;Millennium '73&quot; because the word &quot;<a href="millennium" class="uri" title="wikilink">millennium</a>&quot; evoked the &quot;vision of one peaceful world based on spiritual values&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>The first day of the festival was Thursday, November 8, 1973. The program listed the topic of the day as &quot;What is a Perfect Master?&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> It started at noon with an <a href="oratorio" class="uri" title="wikilink">oratorio</a> composed for the occasion by Erika Anderson.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Rennie Davis opened the program by telling the audience that, &quot;All I can say is, honestly, very soon now, every single human being will know the one who was waited for by every religion of all times has actually come&quot;<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The masters of ceremony were Joan Apter, an early US convert and one of Maharaj Ji's secretaries, and Charles Cameron, one of the guru's earliest converts in the UK and editor of <em><a href="Who_Is_Guru_Maharaj_Ji?_(book)" title="wikilink">Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?</a></em><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Cameron told stories of previous Perfect Masters.

<p><a href="Rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">Rhythm and blues</a> musician <a href="Eric_Mercury" title="wikilink">Eric Mercury</a> performed during the dinner interval. <a href="Stax_Records" title="wikilink">Stax Records</a> had negotiated an agreement with the DLM to make a recording of the event in exchange for showcasing Mercury, one of their new acts. They had already released an album titled &quot;Blue Aquarius&quot; in 1973 that was on sale at the event. Mercury, a Canadian of African ancestry and the only non-member who performed, played before an audience of 5,000 or fewer.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Stax recorded the performance and Mercury said at a press conference that he would give 50 percent of his royalties from the album to the DLM.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> He later told a reporter that while he was interested in the message initially, he was put off by the pressure to join for what he perceived as an effort to gain ethnic diversity.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>Following Mercury was a speech by Bob Mishler and then an hour-long set by the Blue Aquarius orchestra.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The highlight of the evening was a <em>satsang</em> by Maharaj Ji:<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>

I smuggle peace and truth from one country to another. This currency is really rich.

<p>The second day of the festival, Friday, November 9, had the theme of &quot;The Perfect Master is Here&quot;. It featured speeches by mahatmas and by Maharaj Ji's mother, Mata Ji. The Divine Light Dance Ensemble performed a dance piece, <em>Krishna Lila</em>, noted for being well-choreographed.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Music included another choral composition by Erika Anderson, another long set by Blue Aquarius, and a performance by the Apostles, a devotional rock band. Maharaj Ji wore a red <a href="Krishna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krishna</a> robe and later put on a jeweled crown of Krishna,<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> the &quot;Crown of Crowns for the King of Kings&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> His <em>satsang</em> that night included this story:<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a><a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

You go to all the bookstores and to all the kids in the colleges, and all the people on the streets and no one has one anywhere. And you're real depressed and you're sitting there in the park and this little kid comes up and says &quot;Hey man, how'd you like a Superman comic.&quot; And you say, &quot;G'wan. You don't have one.&quot; And this kid pulls it from out of his shirt and it is a genuine; a gen-u-ine Superman comic: and you look at it and say, &quot;Hey man; this must be very expensive&quot;, and he says, &quot;No, take it, it's yours. It's free.&quot; And you don't believe him but then you take it. He just gives it to you.

<dt><strong>Day 3 &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;World Assemblage to Save Humanity&quot;</strong></dt>

</dl>
<p>The third and last day of the festival, Saturday, November 10, was called a &quot;World Assemblage to Save Humanity&quot;. A talk by another brother, Raja Ji, and more performances by Blue Aquarius and the Apostles filled the schedule. Plans for the Divine United Organization and the Divine City were announced. Rennie Davis gave a speech that one reporter called the oratorical high point of the festival. &quot;I tell you now that it is springtime on this earth!&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> <a href="Jerry_Rubin" title="wikilink">Jerry Rubin</a>, a co-defendant in the <a href="Chicago_Seven" title="wikilink">Chicago Seven</a> trial, said he had never heard Davis sound more dangerous.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>The climax of the event was the final <em>satsang</em> by Maharaj Ji, in which he laid out his plan for peace. According to one reporter his basic message was, &quot;You want peace? Give me a try. Let me have a try. I'll establish peace. It's a simple deal.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> One analogy by Maharaj Ji that several reporters noted compared the techniques of Knowledge to a <a href="fuel_filter" title="wikilink">fuel filter</a>:<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>

<p>The thing is that this life is a big car, and inside the car there is a big engine. And in the engine there is a carburetor, which is hooked up to a fuel line. In some cars, before the fuel line hits the carburetor, there is a thing called a filter that makes sure the fuel going into the carburetor is pure. So in this life, the filter for our minds is the Knowledge, and if we are not being filtered properly, many dirty particles enter our minds and eventually the whole engine is destroyed.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>

<p>Scholars describe 1973 as the peak year of the movement,<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a><a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a> or mention a significant drop in new followers.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a> However, Roger E. Olson wrote that &quot;the movement continued to attract large numbers of mainly counterculture followers&quot; despite the disappointments.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> The financial crisis required retrenchment and reorganization.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a><a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a><a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a> After the festival, Maharaj Ji began taking greater responsibility in the movement; he took administrative control of the DLM's US branch within a month of turning 16.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> The following year he got married and became an emancipated minor. Disagreements between Maharaj Ji and his family led to the movement being split between a Western branch, led by Maharaj Ji, and an Indian branch, run by his mother and Bal Bhagwan Ji.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a></p>
<p>The failure of Millennium '73 led the Western branch to shift away from Indian influences and trappings, according to some observers.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a><a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a><a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> Sikh scholar Kirpal Singh Khalsa wrote that the DLM &quot;no longer projected itself as a movement that would include all of humanity in its membership.&quot;<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> The Western DLM moved away from its ascetic, &quot;world-rejecting&quot; origins and adopted a &quot;world-affirming position&quot;.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a> Beginning in 1982, Guru Maharaj Ji changed the DLM into the more loosely organized <a href="Elan_Vital_(organization)" title="wikilink">Elan Vital</a>. Michael York wrote that, as result of poor attendance and financial failure, Maharaj Ji changed the name of the movement and &quot;distanced himself from his status as a divine guru&quot;.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a> He became known as Maharaji or Prem Rawat and was presented as an inspirational speaker and teacher.<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"><sup>368</sup></a><a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a> Bal Bhagwan Ji became known as Satpal Maharaj or Satpal Rawat, and his branch is now known as Manav Utthan Seva Samiti.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a> Both branches have celebrated Hans Jayanti again since 1973.<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"><sup>371</sup></a></p>
