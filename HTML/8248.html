<p>The name comes from a 1904 plan by the <a href="Jesuit" title="wikilink">Jesuits</a> of <a href="Santa_Clara_University" title="wikilink">Santa Clara University</a> to build a new university named for their founder, St. <a href="Ignatius_of_Loyola" title="wikilink">Ignatius of Loyola</a>, in the area. If the plan had come to fruition, the university would have been located in the area of the present-day golf course on Country Club Drive.
