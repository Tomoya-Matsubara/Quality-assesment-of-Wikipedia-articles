<p><strong>Discrete mathematics</strong> is the study of <a href="Mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematical</a> <a href="Mathematical_structure" title="wikilink">structures</a> that are fundamentally <a href="discrete_space" title="wikilink">discrete</a> rather than continuous. In contrast to <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> that have the property of varying &quot;smoothly&quot;, the objects studied in discrete mathematics &lt;U+2013&gt; such as <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>, <a href="Graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graphs</a>, and statements in <a href="Mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">logic</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; such as <a href="calculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">calculus</a> and <a href="Mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">analysis</a>. Discrete objects can often be <a href="enumeration" title="wikilink">enumerated</a> by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with <a href="countable_set" title="wikilink">countable sets</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term &quot;discrete mathematics.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.</p>
<p>The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term <strong>finite mathematics</strong> is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.</p>
<p>Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of <a href="digital_computers" title="wikilink">digital computers</a> which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, <a href="programming_language" title="wikilink">programming languages</a>, <a href="cryptography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptography</a>, <a href="automated_theorem_proving" title="wikilink">automated theorem proving</a>, and <a href="software_development" title="wikilink">software development</a>. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in <a href="operations_research" title="wikilink">operations research</a>.</p>
<p>Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.</p>

<p>The history of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of the field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove the <a href="four_color_theorem" title="wikilink">four color theorem</a>, first stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, using substantial computer assistance).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The need to <a href="Cryptanalysis" title="wikilink">break</a> German codes in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> led to advances in <a href="cryptography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptography</a> and <a href="theoretical_computer_science" title="wikilink">theoretical computer science</a>, with the <a href="Colossus_computer" title="wikilink">first programmable digital electronic computer</a> being developed at England's <a href="Bletchley_Park" title="wikilink">Bletchley Park</a>. At the same time, military requirements motivated advances in <a href="operations_research" title="wikilink">operations research</a>. The <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a> meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances such as <a href="public-key_cryptography" title="wikilink">public-key cryptography</a> being developed in the following decades. Operations research remained important as a tool in business and project management, with the <a href="critical_path_method" title="wikilink">critical path method</a> being developed in the 1950s. The <a href="telecommunication" class="uri" title="wikilink">telecommunication</a> industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory and <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a>. <a href="Formal_verification" title="wikilink">Formal verification</a> of statements in logic has been necessary for <a href="software_development" title="wikilink">software development</a> of <a href="safety-critical_system" title="wikilink">safety-critical systems</a>, and advances in <a href="automated_theorem_proving" title="wikilink">automated theorem proving</a> have been driven by this need.</p>

<p>Several fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, and <a href="combinatorics" class="uri" title="wikilink">combinatorics</a>, are important in addressing the challenging <a href="bioinformatics" class="uri" title="wikilink">bioinformatics</a> problems associated with understanding the <a href="Phylogenetic_tree" title="wikilink">tree of life</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="topics-in-discrete-mathematics">Topics in discrete mathematics</h2>
<h3 id="theoretical-computer-science">Theoretical computer science</h3>

<p><img src="Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif" title="fig:Complexity studies the time taken by algorithms, such as this sorting routine." alt="Complexity studies the time taken by algorithms, such as this sorting routine." width="210" /> Theoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. It draws heavily on <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a> and <a href="Mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms for computing mathematical results. <a href="Computability" class="uri" title="wikilink">Computability</a> studies what can be computed in principle, and has close ties to logic, while complexity studies the time taken by computations. <a href="Automata_theory" title="wikilink">Automata theory</a> and <a href="formal_language" title="wikilink">formal language</a> theory are closely related to computability. <a href="Petri_net" title="wikilink">Petri nets</a> and <a href="process_algebra" title="wikilink">process algebras</a> are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing <a href="VLSI" class="uri" title="wikilink">VLSI</a> electronic circuits. <a href="Computational_geometry" title="wikilink">Computational geometry</a> applies algorithms to geometrical problems, while <a href="computer_image_analysis" title="wikilink">computer image analysis</a> applies them to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes the study of various continuous computational topics.</p>
<h3 id="information-theory">Information theory</h3>

<p><img src="WikipediaBinary.svg" title="fig:The ASCII codes for the word &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, given here in binary, provide a way of representing the word in information theory, as well as for information-processing algorithms." alt="The ASCII codes for the word &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, given here in binary, provide a way of representing the word in information theory, as well as for information-processing algorithms." width="150" /> Information theory involves the quantification of <a href="information" class="uri" title="wikilink">information</a>. Closely related is <a href="coding_theory" title="wikilink">coding theory</a> which is used to design efficient and reliable data transmission and storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous topics such as: <a href="analog_signal" title="wikilink">analog signals</a>, <a href="analog_coding" title="wikilink">analog coding</a>, <a href="analog_encryption" title="wikilink">analog encryption</a>.</p>
<h3 id="logic">Logic</h3>

<p>Logic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and <a href="inference" class="uri" title="wikilink">inference</a>, as well as of <a href="consistency" class="uri" title="wikilink">consistency</a>, <a href="soundness" class="uri" title="wikilink">soundness</a>, and <a href="Completeness_(logic)" title="wikilink">completeness</a>. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in <a href="intuitionistic_logic" title="wikilink">intuitionistic logic</a>) <a href="Peirce&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Peirce's law</a> (((<em>P</em>&lt;U+2192&gt;<em>Q</em>)&lt;U+2192&gt;<em>P</em>)&lt;U+2192&gt;<em>P</em>) is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a <a href="truth_table" title="wikilink">truth table</a>. The study of <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">mathematical proof</a> is particularly important in logic, and has applications to <a href="automated_theorem_proving" title="wikilink">automated theorem proving</a> and <a href="formal_verification" title="wikilink">formal verification</a> of software.</p>
<p><a href="Well-formed_formula" title="wikilink">Logical formulas</a> are discrete structures, as are <a href="Proof_theory" title="wikilink">proofs</a>, which form finite <a href="tree_structure" title="wikilink">trees</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> or, more generally, <a href="directed_acyclic_graph" title="wikilink">directed acyclic graph</a> structures<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> (with each <a href="Rule_of_inference" title="wikilink">inference step</a> combining one or more <a href="premise" class="uri" title="wikilink">premise</a> branches to give a single conclusion). The <a href="truth_value" title="wikilink">truth values</a> of logical formulas usually form a finite set, generally restricted to two values: <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>, but logic can also be continuous-valued, e.g., <a href="fuzzy_logic" title="wikilink">fuzzy logic</a>. Concepts such as infinite proof trees or infinite derivation trees have also been studied,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> e.g. <a href="infinitary_logic" title="wikilink">infinitary logic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-theory">Set theory</h3>

<p>Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies <a href="set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">sets</a>, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a>. <a href="Partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">Partially ordered sets</a> and sets with other <a href="Relation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">relations</a> have applications in several areas.</p>
<p>In discrete mathematics, <a href="countable_set" title="wikilink">countable sets</a> (including <a href="finite_set" title="wikilink">finite sets</a>) are the main focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Georg Cantor</a>'s work distinguishing between different kinds of <a href="infinite_set" title="wikilink">infinite set</a>, motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development of the theory of infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in <a href="descriptive_set_theory" title="wikilink">descriptive set theory</a> makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="combinatorics">Combinatorics</h3>

<p>Combinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged. <a href="Enumerative_combinatorics" title="wikilink">Enumerative combinatorics</a> concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the <a href="twelvefold_way" title="wikilink">twelvefold way</a> provides a unified framework for counting <a href="permutations" class="uri" title="wikilink">permutations</a>, <a href="combinations" class="uri" title="wikilink">combinations</a> and <a href="Partition_of_a_set" title="wikilink">partitions</a>. <a href="Analytic_combinatorics" title="wikilink">Analytic combinatorics</a> concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from <a href="complex_analysis" title="wikilink">complex analysis</a> and <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a>. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and <a href="generating_functions" title="wikilink">generating functions</a> to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining <a href="Asymptotic_analysis" title="wikilink">asymptotic formulae</a>. Design theory is a study of <a href="combinatorial_design" title="wikilink">combinatorial designs</a>, which are collections of subsets with certain <a href="Set_intersection" title="wikilink">intersection</a> properties. <a href="Partition_theory" title="wikilink">Partition theory</a> studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to <a href="integer_partition" title="wikilink">integer partitions</a>, and is closely related to <a href="q-series" class="uri" title="wikilink">q-series</a>, <a href="special_functions" title="wikilink">special functions</a> and <a href="orthogonal_polynomials" title="wikilink">orthogonal polynomials</a>. Originally a part of <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a> and <a href="analysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">analysis</a>, partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field. <a href="Order_theory" title="wikilink">Order theory</a> is the study of <a href="partially_ordered_sets" title="wikilink">partially ordered sets</a>, both finite and infinite.</p>
<h3 id="graph-theory">Graph theory</h3>

<p><img src="TruncatedTetrahedron.gif" title="fig:Graph theory has close links to group theory. This truncated tetrahedron graph is related to the alternating group A4." alt="Graph theory has close links to group theory. This truncated tetrahedron graph is related to the alternating group A4." width="200" /> Graph theory, the study of <a href="Graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graphs</a> and <a href="network_theory" title="wikilink">networks</a>, is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of <a href="topology" class="uri" title="wikilink">topology</a>, e.g. <a href="knot_theory" title="wikilink">knot theory</a>. <a href="Algebraic_graph_theory" title="wikilink">Algebraic graph theory</a> has close links with group theory. There are also <a href="continuous_graph" title="wikilink">continuous graphs</a>, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="probability">Probability</h3>

<p>Discrete probability theory deals with events that occur in countable <a href="sample_spaces" title="wikilink">sample spaces</a>. For example, count observations such as the numbers of birds in flocks comprise only natural number values {0, 1, 2, ...}. On the other hand, continuous observations such as the weights of birds comprise real number values and would typically be modeled by a continuous probability distribution such as the <a href="normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normal</a>. Discrete probability distributions can be used to approximate continuous ones and vice versa. For highly constrained situations such as throwing <a href="dice" class="uri" title="wikilink">dice</a> or experiments with <a href="decks_of_cards" title="wikilink">decks of cards</a>, calculating the probability of events is basically <a href="enumerative_combinatorics" title="wikilink">enumerative combinatorics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="number-theory">Number theory</h3>
<p><img src="Ulam_1.png" title="fig:The Ulam spiral of numbers, with black pixels showing prime numbers. This diagram hints at patterns in the distribution of prime numbers." alt="The Ulam spiral of numbers, with black pixels showing prime numbers. This diagram hints at patterns in the distribution of prime numbers." width="200" />  Number theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general, particularly <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>. It has applications to <a href="cryptography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptography</a>, <a href="cryptanalysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptanalysis</a>, and <a href="cryptology" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptology</a>, particularly with regard to <a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">modular arithmetic</a>, <a href="diophantine_equations" title="wikilink">diophantine equations</a>, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and <a href="primality_test" title="wikilink">primality testing</a>. Other discrete aspects of number theory include <a href="geometry_of_numbers" title="wikilink">geometry of numbers</a>. In <a href="analytic_number_theory" title="wikilink">analytic number theory</a>, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include <a href="transcendental_number" title="wikilink">transcendental numbers</a>, <a href="diophantine_approximation" title="wikilink">diophantine approximation</a>, <a href="p-adic_analysis" title="wikilink">p-adic analysis</a> and <a href="function_field_of_an_algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">function fields</a>.</p>
<h3 id="algebra">Algebra</h3>

<p><a href="Algebraic_structure" title="wikilink">Algebraic structures</a> occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples. Discrete algebras include: <a href="boolean_algebra_(logic)" title="wikilink">boolean algebra</a> used in <a href="logic_gate" title="wikilink">logic gates</a> and programming; <a href="relational_algebra" title="wikilink">relational algebra</a> used in <a href="databases" class="uri" title="wikilink">databases</a>; discrete and finite versions of <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">groups</a>, <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">rings</a> and <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fields</a> are important in <a href="algebraic_coding_theory" title="wikilink">algebraic coding theory</a>; discrete <a href="semigroup" title="wikilink">semigroups</a> and <a href="monoid" title="wikilink">monoids</a> appear in the theory of <a href="formal_languages" title="wikilink">formal languages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="calculus-of-finite-differences-discrete-calculus-or-discrete-analysis">Calculus of finite differences, discrete calculus or discrete analysis</h3>

<p>A <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> defined on an interval of the <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> is usually called a <a href="sequence" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequence</a>. A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a <a href="discrete_dynamical_system" title="wikilink">discrete dynamical system</a>. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, or it could be given implicitly by a <a href="recurrence_relation" title="wikilink">recurrence relation</a> or <a href="difference_equation" title="wikilink">difference equation</a>. Difference equations are similar to a <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equations</a>, but replace <a href="derivative" title="wikilink">differentiation</a> by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance where there are <a href="integral_transforms" title="wikilink">integral transforms</a> in <a href="harmonic_analysis" title="wikilink">harmonic analysis</a> for studying continuous functions or analog signals, there are <a href="discrete_transform" title="wikilink">discrete transforms</a> for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as the <a href="discrete_metric" title="wikilink">discrete metric</a> there are more general discrete or <a href="finite_metric_space" title="wikilink">finite metric spaces</a> and <a href="finite_topological_space" title="wikilink">finite topological spaces</a>.</p>
<h3 id="geometry">Geometry</h3>
<p><img src="SimplexRangeSearching.png" title="fig:Computational geometry applies computer algorithms to representations of geometrical objects." alt="Computational geometry applies computer algorithms to representations of geometrical objects." width="150" />  <a href="Discrete_geometry" title="wikilink">Discrete geometry</a> and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of <em>discrete collections</em> of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is <a href="tessellation" title="wikilink">tiling of the plane</a>. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems.</p>
<h3 id="topology">Topology</h3>
<p>Although <a href="topology" class="uri" title="wikilink">topology</a> is the field of mathematics that formalizes and generalizes the intuitive notion of &quot;continuous deformation&quot; of objects, it gives rise to many discrete topics; this can be attributed in part to the focus on <a href="topological_invariant" title="wikilink">topological invariants</a>, which themselves usually take discrete values. See <a href="combinatorial_topology" title="wikilink">combinatorial topology</a>, <a href="topological_graph_theory" title="wikilink">topological graph theory</a>, <a href="topological_combinatorics" title="wikilink">topological combinatorics</a>, <a href="computational_topology" title="wikilink">computational topology</a>, <a href="discrete_topological_space" title="wikilink">discrete topological space</a>, <a href="finite_topological_space" title="wikilink">finite topological space</a>, <a href="topology_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">topology (chemistry)</a>.</p>

<p>There are many concepts in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions, such as <a href="discrete_calculus" title="wikilink">discrete calculus</a>, <a href="discrete_probability_distribution" title="wikilink">discrete probability distributions</a>, <a href="discrete_Fourier_transform" title="wikilink">discrete Fourier transforms</a>, <a href="discrete_geometry" title="wikilink">discrete geometry</a>, <a href="discrete_logarithm" title="wikilink">discrete logarithms</a>, <a href="discrete_differential_geometry" title="wikilink">discrete differential geometry</a>, <a href="discrete_exterior_calculus" title="wikilink">discrete exterior calculus</a>, <a href="discrete_Morse_theory" title="wikilink">discrete Morse theory</a>, <a href="difference_equation" title="wikilink">difference equations</a>, <a href="discrete_dynamical_system" title="wikilink">discrete dynamical systems</a>, and <a href="Shapley&lt;U+2013&gt;Folkman_lemma#Probability_and_measure_theory" title="wikilink">discrete vector measures</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="applied_mathematics" title="wikilink">applied mathematics</a>, <a href="discrete_modelling" title="wikilink">discrete modelling</a> is the discrete analogue of <a href="continuous_modelling" title="wikilink">continuous modelling</a>. In discrete modelling, discrete formulae are fit to <a href="data" class="uri" title="wikilink">data</a>. A common method in this form of modelling is to use <a href="recurrence_relation" title="wikilink">recurrence relation</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">algebraic geometry</a>, the concept of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking the <a href="Spectrum_of_a_ring" title="wikilink">spectra</a> of <a href="polynomial_ring" title="wikilink">polynomial rings</a> over <a href="finite_field" title="wikilink">finite fields</a> to be models of the <a href="affine_space" title="wikilink">affine spaces</a> over that field, and letting <a href="Algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">subvarieties</a> or spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space. Although the space in which the curves appear has a finite number of points, the curves are not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. For example, every point of the form <span class="math inline"><em>V</em>(<em>x</em> − <em>c</em>) ⊂ Spec <em>K</em>[<em>x</em>] = 𝔸<sup>1</sup></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> a field can be studied either as <span class="math inline">Spec <em>K</em>[<em>x</em>]/(<em>x</em> − <em>c</em>) ≅ Spec <em>K</em></span>, a point, or as the spectrum <span class="math inline">Spec <em>K</em>[<em>x</em>]<sub>(<em>x</em> − <em>c</em>)</sub></span> of the <a href="Localization_of_a_ring" title="wikilink">local ring at (x-c)</a>, a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of <a href="tangent_space" title="wikilink">tangent space</a> called the <a href="Zariski_tangent_space" title="wikilink">Zariski tangent space</a>, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-discrete-and-continuous-mathematics">Hybrid discrete and continuous mathematics</h3>
<p>The <a href="time_scale_calculus" title="wikilink">time scale calculus</a> is a unification of the theory of <a href="difference_equations" title="wikilink">difference equations</a> with that of <a href="differential_equations" title="wikilink">differential equations</a>, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of <a href="hybrid_system" title="wikilink">hybrid dynamical system</a>.</p>
