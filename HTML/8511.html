<p><strong>Tropical Storm Debby</strong> caused extensive flooding in <a href="North_Florida" title="wikilink">North Florida</a> and the <a href="Florida_Panhandle" title="wikilink">Florida Panhandle</a>. The fourth <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> and <a href="Tropical_cyclone_naming" title="wikilink">named storm</a> of the <a href="2012_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">2012 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Debby developed from a trough of low pressure in the central <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> on June 23 Despite a projected track toward landfall in <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> or <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast or northeastward. The storm steadily strengthened, and at 1800 UTC on June 25, Debby attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Dry air, westerly wind shear, and <a href="upwelling" class="uri" title="wikilink">upwelling</a> prevented further intensification. Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June 26, it was a minimal tropical storm. At 2100 UTC, the storm made landfall near <a href="Steinhatchee,_Florida" title="wikilink">Steinhatchee, Florida</a> with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Debby continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June 27.</p>
<p>The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path. Rainfall peaked at  in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern <a href="Wakulla_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Wakulla County</a>. The <a href="Sopchoppy_River" title="wikilink">Sopchoppy River</a>, which reached its record height, flooded at least 400 structures in Wakulla County. Additionally, the <a href="Suwannee_River" title="wikilink">Suwannee River</a> reached its highest level since <a href="Hurricane_Dora" title="wikilink">Hurricane Dora</a> in <a href="1964_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1964</a>. Further south in <a href="Pasco_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Pasco County</a>, the <a href="Anclote_River" title="wikilink">Anclote River</a> and <a href="Pithlachascotee_River" title="wikilink">Pithlachascotee River</a> overflowed, flooding communities with &quot;head deep&quot; water and causing damage to 106 homes. An additional 587 homes were inundated after the <a href="Black_Creek_(Florida)" title="wikilink">Black Creek</a> overflowed in <a href="Clay_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Clay County</a>. Several roads and highways in North Florida were left impassable, including <a href="Interstate_10" title="wikilink">Interstate 10</a> and <a href="U.S._Route_90" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 90</a>. <a href="U.S._Route_19" title="wikilink">U.S. Routes 19</a> and <a href="U.S._Route_98" title="wikilink">98</a> were also inundated by coastal flooding. In <a href="Central_Florida" title="wikilink">Central</a> and <a href="South_Florida" title="wikilink">South Florida</a>, damage was primarily caused by tornadoes, one of which caused a fatality. Overall, Debby at least $210 million in losses and 10 deaths, 8 in Florida and 1 each in <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a> and <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The <a href="Intertropical_Convergence_Zone" title="wikilink">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a> (ITCZ) migrated northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico in mid-June. Coinciding with a <a href="Madden&lt;U+2013&gt;Julian_oscillation" title="wikilink">Madden&lt;U+2013&gt;Julian oscillation</a>, a weak surface low pressure area developed on June 19, and subsequently moved inland over the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a>. While the system crossed the peninsula, a tropical wave moved through the northwestern <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a> on June 18. The wave reached the Gulf of Mexico on June 20 and merged with the low a few days later, spawning a trough of low pressure on June 22. Located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, moderate vertical wind shear caused the system to remain disorganized. Nonetheless, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the trough acquired a low-level circulation on June 23, while ships in the area reported tropical storm force winds. Thus, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Debby developed at 1200 UTC on June 23, centered about  south of mouth of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Becoming a tropical storm on June 23, Debby became the earliest fourth named storm in the Atlantic basin, surpassing the old record set by <a href="Hurricane_Dennis" title="wikilink">Hurricane Dennis</a> on July 5, 2005. Initially, Debby was predicted to curve westward and potentially threaten <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A deepening trough would curve the storm westward, while wind shear was predicted to decrease.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Although the storm generated very cold cloud tops, much of the convection was located more than  from the center and still displaced to the east.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By 1200 UTC on June 24, the forecast path was shifted from east-central Texas to southeastern Louisiana.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Despite persistent wind shear, Debby was strengthening and around that time, the storm attained its <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained wind</a> speed of 65 mph (100 km/h).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later on June 24, the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> noted in its next advisory that this &quot;is a very difficult and highly uncertain forecast&quot;, citing Debby's slow movement and widespread <a href="Computer_simulation" title="wikilink">computer forecast models</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <img src="Tropical_Storm_Debby_Jun_26_2012_1845Z.jpg" title="fig:Tropical Storm Debby approaching landfall in Florida on June 26" alt="Tropical Storm Debby approaching landfall in Florida on June 26" /> The forecast track for Debby was shifted significantly to the east late on June 24, and it was predicted that the storm would move northward and make landfall near <a href="Panama_City,_Florida" title="wikilink">Panama City, Florida</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Based on a <a href="dropsonde" class="uri" title="wikilink">dropsonde</a> estimate, Debby attained its minimum <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of  at 0000 UTC on June 25. However, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear, drier air, and <a href="upwelling" class="uri" title="wikilink">upwelling</a>, caused by Debby's slow movement.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It was initially composed of multiple small swirls, but consolidated into one well-defined low-level circulation by early on June 25.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Due to its excessively slow movement and no prediction for acceleration, the National Hurricane Center remarked that, &quot;the cyclone does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A burst in deep convection occurred later on June 25, though adverse environmental conditions prevented re-intensification. Debby began curving east-northeastward and began to speed up on June 26, in response to a mid-latitude trough digging into the western Atlantic Ocean. While approaching the <a href="Big_Bend_(Florida)" title="wikilink">Florida Big Bend</a>, Debby produced only a small area of deep convection on satellite imagery.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>At 2100 UTC June 26, Debby made landfall near <a href="Steinhatchee,_Florida" title="wikilink">Steinhatchee, Florida</a> with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm weakened quickly after moving inland, and by early on June 27, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, while located about  north of <a href="Gainesville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Gainesville, Florida</a>. Debby maintained tropical cyclone status while crossing Florida, but degenerated into a trough of low pressure by 1800 UTC on June 27.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center three hours later, the agency noted that Debby could eventually reacquire tropical characteristics.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After its dissipation, however, the remnants did not regenerate into a tropical cyclone, but re-developed a new center of circulation and strengthened slightly due to <a href="baroclinic_zone" title="wikilink">baroclinic</a> conditions. As it accelerated northward, Debby's remnants became increasingly frontal in nature, and once again degenerated into an open trough at 1800 UTC on June 30; at this time, the disturbance was located south of <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>Upon development of Debby on June 23, a tropical storm warning was issued from the mouth of the <a href="Pearl_River_(Mississippi&lt;U+2013&gt;Louisiana)" title="wikilink">Pearl River</a> to <a href="Morgan_City,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Morgan City, Louisiana</a>, excluding <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> or <a href="Lake_Pontchartrain" title="wikilink">Lake Pontchartrain</a>. On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border to the mouth of the <a href="Ochlockonee_River" title="wikilink">Ochlockonee River</a> in Florida. At 1500 UTC on June 24, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of the <a href="Suwannee_River" title="wikilink">Suwannee River</a>. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to <a href="Anclote_Key" title="wikilink">Anclote Key</a>. These were all canceled at 1500 UTC on June 25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from <a href="Destin,_Florida" title="wikilink">Destin</a> to <a href="Englewood,_Florida" title="wikilink">Englewood, Florida</a>. Early on June 26, a tropical storm warning was issued from <a href="Mexico_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Mexico Beach</a> to <a href="Englewood,_Florida" title="wikilink">Englewood, Florida</a>. By 2100 UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of <a href="Steinhatchee_River" title="wikilink">Steinhatchee River</a> in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In addition to <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a>, voluntary evacuations were issued for several areas in northwest Florida during the approach of the storm; a mandatory evacuation was issued for <a href="St._George_Island_(Florida)" title="wikilink">St. George Island</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
