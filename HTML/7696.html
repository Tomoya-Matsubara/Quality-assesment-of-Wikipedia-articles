<p><strong>Bury</strong> or <strong>bury angle</strong>, is a <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_terms" title="wikilink">professional wrestling term</a>. The commom meaning if this term is the lowering or reducing of a wrestler's popularity and status. It is the complete opposite of a <a href="Push_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">push</a>, or <a href="Over_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">putting a wrestler over</a>. It is the act of a promoter or booker causing a wrestler to lose popularity by forcing him to <a href="squash_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">lose matches badly</a>, <a href="job_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">continuously</a>, and/or making him participate in unentertaining or degrading storylines. It can be a form of punishment for real-life backstage disagreements or <a href="#F" title="wikilink">feuds</a> between the wrestler and the booker, the wrestler falling out of favor with the company, or the wrestler receiving an unpopular <a href="#G" title="wikilink">gimmick</a> that causes him to lose credibility regardless of win-loss record.</p>
<p>A common burial position is &quot;<a href="job_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">jobber to the stars</a>&quot;, which is when a middle-card wrestler defeats pure lower-card jobbers, but who consistently loses to higher-card, main event, and up-and-coming wrestlers. This usually happens to popular wrestlers towards the end of their careers, including <a href="Tony_Garea" title="wikilink">Tony Garea</a>, and <a href="Tito_Santana" title="wikilink">Tito Santana</a>. Some of the most popular jobbers and buried wrestlers are <a href="Val_Venis" title="wikilink">Val Venis</a> , <a href="Shoichi_Funaki" title="wikilink">Shoichi Funaki</a>, <a href="Tommy_Dreamer" title="wikilink">Tommy Dreamer</a>, <a href="Jim_Duggan" title="wikilink">Jim Duggan</a>, <a href="Super_Crazy" title="wikilink">Super Crazy</a>, and <a href="Nunzio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nunzio</a>.</p>
<p>The much-hyped, but heavily-booed, Goldberg vs. Lesnar match at <a href="Wrestlemania_XX" title="wikilink">Wrestlemania XX</a> is notable, for both Goldberg and Lesnar received <a href="Stone_Cold_Stunner" title="wikilink">Stone Cold Stunners</a> from the guest referee, <a href="Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin" title="wikilink">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>, at the end of the match. This, alongside the fact that both men left <a href="WWE" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWE</a>, and soon retired from wrestling, was considered by many as a semi-burial of both wrestlers.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The term can also be used for whenever a wrestling company <a href="jumping_the_shark" title="wikilink">jumps the shark</a>, therefore rapidly loses ratings, fans, and finally become bankrupt. The most infamous cause or event in this case seen by many critics would be the <a href="The_Fingerpoke_of_Doom" title="wikilink">The Fingerpoke of Doom</a>, an incident that took place in January 4, 1999 on <a href="WCW_Monday_Nitro" title="wikilink">WCW Monday Nitro</a>, at the <a href="Georgia_Dome" title="wikilink">Georgia Dome</a>. This event is considered by some as one of the pivotal broadcasts that led to the doom and burial of WCW during the <a href="Monday_Night_Wars" title="wikilink">Monday Night Wars</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Triple_H" title="wikilink">Triple H</a> was given a brief burial in the summer of 1996 by <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a> as punishment for the infamous <a href="The_Kliq#Curtain_Call:_The_MSG_Incident" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden Incident</a>. He was demoted from championship contender to a jobber. The punishment fell solely on him, due to reason that <a href="Shawn_Michaels" title="wikilink">Shawn Michaels</a> was the WWF Champion at the time and was one of the promotion's biggest drawing performer. <a href="Scott_Hall" title="wikilink">Scott Hall</a> and <a href="Kevin_Nash" title="wikilink">Kevin Nash</a> soon left for <a href="WCW" class="uri" title="wikilink">WCW</a>, so they also escaped punishment. Triple H went from main event matches to opening matches, wrestling inexperienced or lesser experienced wrestlers. This punishment turned out to have a major impact on the WWF's future, for it only delayed his rise to prominence in the business, as he would go on to win the following year's King of the Ring, the <a href="WWF_Intercontinental_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Intercontinental Championship</a> five months later, and later become World Champion on many occasions. <a href="The_Undertaker" title="wikilink">The Undertaker</a> stated in HHH: The Game DVD that when HHH first arrived in the WWF, he saw him as an arrogant person who only looked out for himself, but when HHH took his punishment and did not complain, he earned Undertaker's respect.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>A burial incident occured at a <a href="house_show" title="wikilink">house show</a> in <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>,<a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, involving former WWE wrestler <a href="Carl_Ouellet" title="wikilink">Jean-Pierre Lafitte</a>. Lafitte was booked to win a match against then-<a href="List_of_WWE_Champions" title="wikilink">WWF Champion</a> <a href="Kevin_Nash" title="wikilink">Kevin Nash</a>, as Montreal was Lafitte's hometown. Shortly before the match, Lafitte got into a backstage argument between <a href="Shawn_Michaels" title="wikilink">Shawn Michaels</a> and Lafitte ensued, as Lafitte refused to lose to <a href="Kevin_Nash" title="wikilink">Kevin Nash</a>, and put <a href="The_Kliq" title="wikilink">The Kliq</a> over.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As a result, the match between the two ended in a <a href="Professional_wrestling#Countout" title="wikilink">double-countout</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Micheals referenced the incident in his book, saying that &quot;we [The Kliq] <a href="Burial_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">buried</a> him [Ouellet]&quot; as he did not want to put Nash over. Lafitte was released soon after. Contrary to rumors, Michaels also stated that WWF chairman <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a> did not fire Lafitte.</p>
<p>Former <a href="WWE" class="uri" title="wikilink">WWE</a> wrestler <a href="Orlando_Jordan" title="wikilink">Orlando Jordan</a> wrestled and repeatedly submitted to <a href="Chris_Benoit" title="wikilink">Chris Benoit</a> in a record of matches that only lasted mere seconds. The first match lasted 25.5 seconds at <a href="SummerSlam_(2005)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Following this quick match, Jordan attempted to win his title back on multiple occasions, leading to 3 consecutive losses with all matches lasting less than a minute. The first rematch lasted 23.4 seconds.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> During the second rematch, Jordan actually almost knocked out Benoit with a punch in the opening moments but still lost at 22.5 seconds, which was even faster than the first match. During the third match, Jordan cleverly stalled, avoiding the <a href="Professional_wrestling_holds#Crossface" title="wikilink">Crippler Crossface</a>. The time which was being displayed on the TitanTron, went over 25 seconds. He got so excited when his time went over 30 seconds that he dropped his guard and Benoit took the opportunity to lock on the <a href="Sharpshooter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sharpshooter</a> for a win at the 49.8 second mark. These series of losses were considered by many to be the ending of Orlando's brief run in the WWE, before it even started. Soon afterwards, WWE was attempting to push Orlando as a <a href="#F" title="wikilink">face</a>, but this never came to fruition, as the fans failed to get behind him.</p>
