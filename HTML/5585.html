<p><strong>Carucage</strong> was a land tax in medieval England, based on the size of the estate owned by the taxpayer, and was a replacement for the older <a href="danegeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">danegeld</a>, which was last collected in 1162. Carucage was first collected by King <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard I of England</a> in 1194, and was sporadically assessed through the following two reigns, but the last time it was assessed was in 1224. Thereafter, it was replaced by taxes on income and moveable property.</p>
<p>It was only collected six times in the years between 1194 and 1224, and never raised sums as large as other taxes collected. The main revenue sources for the government in this time came from royal and feudal rights. The method of assessing the size of the estate owned changed from the early use of the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Survey</a> assessments to new valuations based on either sworn testimony of neighbors or a calculation based on the number of ploughteams used by the taxpayer. The tax was collected for a variety of reasons, from the need to pay Richard's ransom in 1194 to King <a href="John_of_England" title="wikilink">John's</a> use of it as a way to pay his inheritance relief in 1200. King <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> used it to pay for military campaigns, both in England and on the continent.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>English taxation after the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a> was based on the <a href="geld" class="uri" title="wikilink">geld</a> or <a href="danegeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">danegeld</a>, a national tax paid by all free men. The king could demand payment of geld without consultation with his barons or other subjects, and could assess it at varying levels. It was based on the number of <a href="Hide_(unit)" title="wikilink">hides</a> of land owned by the taxpayer.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A hide was a variable amount of land, often equated to the amount of land required to support a family for a year, or the amount of land an eight-ox ploughteam would plough in one year.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The total amount varied wildly depending on the fertility of the land. The size could be as small as  in Berkshire, up to  elsewhere.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>|group=notes}} However, during King <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I's</a> reign, increasing numbers of exemptions and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld decreased its importance to the <a href="Exchequer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exchequer</a>. During the <a href="The_Anarchy" title="wikilink">disorders of King Stephen's</a> reign, it is unclear if geld was collected at all.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Stephen's successor, King <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> collected geld twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161&lt;U+2013&gt;1162, but did not collect it again during his reign. Because of its unpopularity, the halting of geld may have been a political compromise on Henry's part.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="under-richard-i">Under Richard I</h2>
<p>Under Henry's son King <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard I</a>, the geld was replaced with the carucage which was also based on land.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Carucage was first collected in 1194, and was established by <a href="Hubert_Walter" title="wikilink">Hubert Walter</a>, the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and <a href="Justiciar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justiciar</a> of England. It was the first land tax collected in England since the geld's elimination.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The basis of the tax was the size of the estate in hides or <a href="carucate" title="wikilink">carucates</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The carucate was a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox ploughteam in a year,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and was normally considered to be equivalent to a hide.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This collection of the carucage was actually a <a href="feudal_aid" title="wikilink">feudal aid</a>, rather than a tax, as it was first levied under King <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard I of England</a> in order to pay Richard's ransom when he was imprisoned returning from the Third Crusade. In 1194, the assessment was based upon the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Survey</a>, completed in 1087.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1198 the carucage was again collected and was based on the carucate, figured at ,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> or .<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This levy was often titled the &quot;great carucage&quot;. A first assessment of 2 shillings per carucate was made, then later a further 3 shillings was ordered.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This tax was collected to provide the king with money for his military campaigns in France,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and raised about &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Later, a number of fines were levied on taxpayers for evading payment.{{#tag:ref|These are recorded in the 1199 Pipe Roll.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>|group=notes}} That fines needed to be paid suggests that the 1198 tax was not very successful.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The medieval chronicler <a href="Roger_of_Howden" title="wikilink">Roger of Howden</a> is the main source for information on the 1198 carucage.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to Roger, assessments were carried out in each shire by a commission of two royal officials who worked in each <a href="Hundred_(administrative_division)" title="wikilink">hundred</a> with two local knights, who took sworn testimony in each village from four villagers and the <a href="bailiff" title="wikilink">bailiffs</a> of the barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded; the sheriff received the money and forwarded it to the treasury.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they was handed into the Exchequer, a special procedure recorded the payments,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> which were deposited into a special set of accounts.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have succeeded because, later, justices were sent out with instructions to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result, 23 counties paid fines in order to secure an end to inquiries about the carucage.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1198, the clergy and ecclesiastics in England resisted Richard's attempt to collect the carucage from their estates. In response, Richard deprived the clergy of the use of the royal courts and forced them to buy back, for a sum greater than the carucage amount, the ability to use the courts.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="under-john">Under John</h2>
<p>King <a href="John_of_England" title="wikilink">John</a>, Richard's brother and successor, only collected the carucage once, in 1200. John set the amount to be collected from each carucate at 3 <a href="shillings" class="uri" title="wikilink">shillings</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Revenues from this taxation do not appear in the 1200 <a href="Pipe_Roll" title="wikilink">Pipe Roll</a>, which may mean that it was paid into a special commission in the Exchequer. Further evidence of this is the fact that <a href="William_de_Wrotham" title="wikilink">William de Wrotham</a> is designated as <em>receptores carucagii</em>, or recievers of the carucage, in official records.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> It is unknown whether the assessments used the previous system from 1198 or if a new system was set up.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The medieval chronicler <a href="Ralph_of_Coggeshall" title="wikilink">Ralph of Coggeshall</a> noted that an &quot;order went throughout England by the justices{{#tag:ref|Or possibly &quot;from the justices&quot; in place of &quot;by the justices&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>|group=notes}} or the king&quot; to collect the tax.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This may imply that the king appointed justices to collect the tax.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The carucage was raised in order to pay John's <a href="feudal_relief" title="wikilink">feudal relief</a>, or payment due on inheriting lands, for his 1199 inheritance of lands in France.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The relief had been set by King <a href="Philip_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Philip II of France</a> at 20,000 <a href="mark_(money)" title="wikilink">marks</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The carucage raised about &lt;U+00A3&gt;3000, although this is just an estimate from later revenues raised under the following reign.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Cistercians" title="wikilink">Cistercian</a> monasteries in the north of England resisted paying the tax, claiming an immunity to taxation. John put pressure on them, as he was in the north when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, now chancellor. Walter secured the promise of a payment of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 from the abbeys as a group, but in June 1200 the king rejected the offer as too small. In October, the king returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through the intercession of Walter, the king capitulated and recognized the Cistercian immunity from taxation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="under-henry-iii">Under Henry III</h2>
<p>John's son, King <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a>, only assessed the carucage three times, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was to secure the consent of the great council for the levying of the tax, which was collected from both laymen and clergy.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The 1217 tax was once more assessed at 3 shillings per carucate.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The assessment method to determine the amount of lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information, swearing an oath that it was correct.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, leading to the possibility that that year's revenue was collected into a separate branch of the Exchequer.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The tax was collected in order to defray the expenses of the war being fought against <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Prince Louis of France</a>, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1220 carucage was definitely collected by a special commission, and it was paid not into the Exchequer, but instead was paid to the <a href="Templar_Order" title="wikilink">Templar Order</a> church in London, the <a href="New_Temple" title="wikilink">New Temple</a>. The three men appointed to the commission were William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The three commissioners were responsible for all the accounting for the sums received, which were over &lt;U+00A3&gt;3000.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short, with the orders for the assessments to be made going out in August, but requiring the tax to be collected by <a href="Michaelmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michaelmas</a> in late September.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The 1220 tax also attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting wastelands from taxation.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler, as ploughteams were counted to determine the land size. This tax gathered around &lt;U+00A3&gt;5500.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> There was some difficulty in collecting the tax, however, as some counties did not pay, and a number of barons rejected the tax, at least at first.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The 1220 carucage was for the defense of Poitou.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1224 carucage was actually an aid levied on the clergy alone,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and also did not appear in the Pipe Roll. Indications are that the clergy who were assessed for the tax also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the revenues raised were paid into the Wardrobe.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The 1224 assessment was also based on ploughteams,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and was assessed in order to pay for the recovery of the lost lands in France.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>The tax was abandoned after 1224,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> with later revenue being collected in taxes on moveable property, not land.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> A probable reason for the abandonment of the tax was the greater revenues gained from other taxes.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue to supplement <a href="scutage" class="uri" title="wikilink">scutage</a>, the fine paid by a knight or baron to avoid military service.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It was also supposed to help increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands on them. However, it came to be replaced by the taxes on moveable property that were first asssessed in 1207. Carucage, although deriving from the old danegeld, was a new experiment in revenue collection. However it was only collected for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Although it was used intermittently to collect revenue during the reigns of Richard I and John and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income during these years remained scutage, feudal dues, and royal rights such as justice and manipulating the coinage.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
