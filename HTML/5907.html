<p>In his original appearance, Imhotep was portrayed by <a href="Boris_Karloff" title="wikilink">Boris Karloff</a> as a priest of <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egypt</a> who is <a href="mummification" title="wikilink">mummified</a> by an unnamed pharaoh as punishment for attempting to resurrect his lover, Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. Imhotep is accidentally revived when an archaeological expedition discovers his mummy and one of the archaeologists unknowingly reads an ancient life-giving spell.</p>
<p>Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists and assumes the identity of Ardath Bey, a modern Egyptian. In this form he helps the archaeologists find the tomb of Ankh-es-en-amon. When Bey meets a woman, Helen Grosvenor, who bears a striking resemblance to the Ankh-es-en-amon, he realizes that she is a <a href="reincarnation" class="uri" title="wikilink">reincarnation</a> of the princess, and attempts to mummify Grosvenor and make her his bride. In the end Grosvenor, recalling her past life, appeals to the goddess <a href="Isis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isis</a> who causes Imhotep to be dissolved.</p>

<p>In the 1999 remake, <strong>Imhotep</strong> (portrayed by <a href="Arnold_Vosloo" title="wikilink">Arnold Vosloo</a>) is the high priest of Pharaoh <a href="Seti_I" title="wikilink">Seti I</a>, who betrayed his <a href="pharaoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharaoh</a> out of love for Seti's mistress, Ankh-su-namun. Imhotep was subjected to a curse as punishment for his attempt to resurrect Ankh-su-namun after she kills Seti: He is condemned to remain alive as he is devoured by sacred <a href="scarab" title="wikilink">scarabs</a> for all eternity. If awakened, however, he would command the sands and the <a href="Ten_Plagues" title="wikilink">Ten Plagues</a>, as well as being virtually immortal.</p>
<p>After he is unintentionally awakened in the 1920s, Imhotep seeks to use Evelyn Carnahan as the sacrifice with which he will resurrect Ankh-su-namun. Evelyn, with the help of soldier <a href="Rick_O&#39;Connell" title="wikilink">Rick O'Connell</a>, finds a spell that rescinds Imhotep's immortality and strips him of his powers, sending his soul to the underworld.</p>
<h2 id="the-mummy-returns"><em>The Mummy Returns</em></h2>
<p>In the 2001 sequel, <em><a href="The_Mummy_Returns" title="wikilink">The Mummy Returns</a></em>, Imhotep is resurrected by an ancient brotherhood who seek to pit him against the <a href="Scorpion_King" title="wikilink">Scorpion King</a>, thus granting him command of the army of <a href="Anubis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anubis</a> with which he can conquer the world. Aided by the physical reincarnation of Ankh-su-namun — whose soul is eventually fully restored to her body — Imhotep makes his way to the Scorpion King's temple, but his powers are taken by Anubis, who wishes him to fight the King as a mortal.</p>
<p>As he and Rick O'Connell clash against each other and the King, Rick uses the Spear of <a href="Osiris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osiris</a>, a powerful mystical weapon, to open a portal to <a href="Hell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hell</a>. When Evelyn risks her life to save Rick while Ankh-su-namun flees rather than trying to help Imhotep, the resurrected priest hurls himself into Hell in despair.</p>
