<p>The <strong>Onerahi Branch</strong>, sometimes known as the <strong>Grahamstown Railway</strong>, was a <a href="branch_line" title="wikilink">branch line</a> <a href="railway" class="uri" title="wikilink">railway</a> in the <a href="Northland_Region" title="wikilink">Northland Region</a> of <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>. It operated from <a href="1911" class="uri" title="wikilink">1911</a> until <a href="1933" class="uri" title="wikilink">1933</a> and linked the city of <a href="Whangarei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whangarei</a> to the nearby harbour in <a href="Onerahi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Onerahi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In the early <a href="1880s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1880s</a>, a wharf near the city of Whangarei had been established in the upper reaches of <a href="Whangarei_Harbour" title="wikilink">Whangarei Harbour</a>. Roughly 20 years later the maintenance bill was rising and the wharf's inadequacies were being revealed as it was too shallow for some vessels to access. The deep-water wharves in nearby Onerahi were considerably more desirable, and in <a href="1899" class="uri" title="wikilink">1899</a> approval was granted to extend the railway from Whangarei to Onerahi. It took until July <a href="1901" class="uri" title="wikilink">1901</a> for construction to get underway, and in May <a href="1902" class="uri" title="wikilink">1902</a> a contract was let to build a bridge across Whangarei Harbour. It was 323 metres long with a central lifting span, and completed in <a href="1904" class="uri" title="wikilink">1904</a>. It was not long before the bridge was nicknamed the <a href="Gull" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gull</a> Roost, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Some work continued for two years after the bridge was finished, but construction ground to a halt in <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a> and no more work was done for four years. It recommenced during <a href="1910" class="uri" title="wikilink">1910</a> and the line was finished the next year. It came into the possession of the Railways Department on <a href="October_2" title="wikilink">2 October</a> <a href="1911" class="uri" title="wikilink">1911</a>. At this time, it was the southern end of the isolated Whangarei railway network, which extended northwards to <a href="Okaihau_Branch" title="wikilink">Okaihau</a> and <a href="Opua_Branch" title="wikilink">Opua</a>, and construction of the <a href="North_Auckland_Line" title="wikilink">North Auckland Line</a> that would link the isolated section to <a href="Auckland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auckland</a> and the <a href="Rail_transport_in_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">national rail network</a> was underway.</p>
<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>For over a decade, the Onerahi Branch was a very busy line. When it opened, the primary method of transport between Auckland and Whangarei for both passengers and freight involved a <a href="steamboat" title="wikilink">steamer</a> between Auckland and Onerahi and the train from Onerahi to Whangarei. Trains ran to connect with the steamers, with both dedicated goods services and &quot;mixed&quot; trains for both passengers and freight operating.</p>
<p>In <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>, the North Auckland Line was completed, establishing a direct railway link from Whangarei to Auckland. This was far superior to the coastal steamers and both passenger and freight traffic on the Onerahi Branch rapidly spiralled downwards. The condition of the wharf was also declining, and when the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> set in there was no reason to continue operating the railway. It closed on <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">30 June</a> <a href="1933" class="uri" title="wikilink">1933</a>. In <a href="1937" class="uri" title="wikilink">1937</a>, the wharf was removed.</p>
<h2 id="the-branch-today">The branch today</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the Gull Roost bridge no longer exists, but some of the track has been converted into a public walking track, the Waimahanga Walkway. It includes footbridges over two creeks using the use of old railway bridge piers. Some formation not used by the walkway, is also visible.</p>
<h2 id="similar-proposals">Similar proposals</h2>
<p>In the <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>, two proposals to build a similar branch line from Whangarei to a deepwater port were made. This line was to closely follow the route of a much earlier proposed line that was nearly built. In <a href="1914" class="uri" title="wikilink">1914</a>, a railway was surveyed to run south from Whangarei to <a href="Waipu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waipu</a>, and although <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> delayed the start of any work, the construction of formation was in progress in <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>. However, in <a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a>, construction was abandoned without any track being laid as road transport was beginning to compete with rail and an insignificant branch to serve local farming interests was no longer seen as necessary.</p>
<p>Many years later, a deepwater harbour was established at nearby <a href="Marsden_Point" title="wikilink">Marsden Point</a> as an oil port, and after the <a href="1973_oil_crisis" title="wikilink">1973 oil crisis</a> it was proposed to convert the nearby Marsden B Power Station to use coal from the <a href="Waikato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waikato</a>. The railways have always carried significant tonnages of Waikato coal, and this proposal would have certainly required a railway link had it come to fruition.</p>
<p>In <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a> it was suggested that Marsden Point could be used for forestry export, and a 14-kilometre branch from the North Auckland Line was proposed, but it was not built.</p>
