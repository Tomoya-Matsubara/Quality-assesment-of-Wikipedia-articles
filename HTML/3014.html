<p>The <strong>Medium Tank M7</strong> was originally conceived as an up-gunned replacement for the <a href="M3_Stuart" title="wikilink">Light Tank M3/M5</a>. The project was supposed to mount the same <a href="75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6" title="wikilink">75mm armament</a> as the <a href="M4_Sherman" title="wikilink">Sherman</a> while retaining the light weight and maneuverability of the <a href="M3_Stuart" title="wikilink">M3 Stuart</a>; however, during development the weight of the prototype surpassed the US Army's standard for light tanks and crossed into the medium category.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The M7 had significantly less armor than the <a href="M4_Sherman" title="wikilink">M4</a>, boasted no greater firepower, and held only a slight advantage in top speed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For these reasons, and because the M4 was already battle-tested and in full production, the M7 was put aside shortly after completing trials.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>On January 1941, the Armored force prepared a list of characteristics for a new light tank. It was assigned the designation T7. During the development program, its weight increased from 14 to almost 27 tons. A more apt classification was thus given by OCM 18522, dated 6 August 1942, which standardized the T7E5 as the M7 medium.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="classifications">Classifications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>T7</strong> - Welded hull, five speed Hydramatic transmission, individual sprung volute suspension</li>
<li><strong>T7E1</strong> - Riveted hull, formed homogenous plate turret, torque converter<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>T7E2</strong> - Cast upper hull, Wright R-975 Engine, Warner Gear torque converter, armed with <a href="Ordnance_QF_6-pounder" title="wikilink">Ordnance QF 6-pounder</a> Mark III</li>
<li><strong>T7E3</strong> - Welded hull and turret, twin Hercules DRXBS diesel engines, Detroit Gear automatic transmission</li>
<li><strong>T7E4</strong> - Welded hull and turret, twin Cadillac engines, two Hydramatic transmissions</li>
<li><strong>T7E5</strong> - T7E2 rearmed with <a href="75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6" title="wikilink">75 mm M3</a> standardized as <strong>M7</strong> medium<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Test revealed that the produced vehicles were heavier than anticipated at 28 to 29 tons fully stowed. This reduced performance and production was halted until it could be rectified. Analysis of the problem indicated that it was caused by castings being thicker than specified. Six of the production tanks were then modified to use the lightest castings possible and their power trains were revised to improve performance. The modified vehicles were referred to as M7E2s in some documents. Testing of the modified vehicles revealed improved performance but only at lower speeds and that the performance was considered inferior to the <a href="M4_Sherman_variants#US_M4_sub-types" title="wikilink">M4A3 medium tank</a>. The 6 modified vehicles and the remaining 7 were accepted as M7 mediums bringing the total run to 13 tanks. Thus production acceptance records show only a total of 7 tanks.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
