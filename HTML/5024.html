<p><strong><em>Jurassic Park</em></strong> is a <a href="1993_in_film" title="wikilink">1993</a> <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="Steven_Spielberg" title="wikilink">Steven Spielberg</a> and based on the <a href="Jurassic_Park" title="wikilink">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="Michael_Crichton" title="wikilink">Michael Crichton</a>. The film centers on the island of <a href="Isla_Nublar" title="wikilink">Isla Nublar</a>, where scientists have created an <a href="amusement_park" title="wikilink">amusement park</a> of <a href="cloned" class="uri" title="wikilink">cloned</a> <a href="dinosaurs" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinosaurs</a>. John Hammond (<a href="Richard_Attenborough" title="wikilink">Richard Attenborough</a>) invites a group of scientists, played by <a href="Sam_Neill" title="wikilink">Sam Neill</a>, <a href="Jeff_Goldblum" title="wikilink">Jeff Goldblum</a> and <a href="Laura_Dern" title="wikilink">Laura Dern</a>, to visit the park. Sabotage sets the dinosaurs on the loose, and technicians and visitors attempt to escape the island.</p>
<p>Development of the film began before the novel was even published, and Crichton was hired to contribute to a script that cut much of its story. Spielberg hired <a href="Stan_Winston" title="wikilink">Stan Winston Studios</a>' puppets and worked with <a href="Industrial_Light_and_Magic" title="wikilink">Industrial Light and Magic</a> to develop cutting-edge <a href="Computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">CGI</a> to portray the dinosaurs. <em>Jurassic Park</em> was well received by critics, although they criticized the characterization. During its release, the film grossed $914 million, becoming the most successful film yet released, and it is currently the <a href="List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="wikilink">eighth-highest grossing feature film</a>. Most significantly, the film inspired a new breed of films that primarily used CGI for special effects. The film was followed by <em><a href="The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park" title="wikilink">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em> in <a href="1997_in_film" title="wikilink">1997</a> and by <em><a href="Jurassic_Park_III" title="wikilink">Jurassic Park III</a></em> in <a href="2001_in_film" title="wikilink">2001</a>. A <a href="Jurassic_Park_IV" title="wikilink">fourth film</a> is currently in development.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p><includeonly>Improve grammar, but don't extend it, plot is already complex</includeonly> On Isla Nublar, an <a href="InGen" class="uri" title="wikilink">InGen</a> employee is killed while releasing a <em><a href="Velociraptor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Velociraptor</a></em> into a penhold, prompting a lawsuit from his family. <a href="Chief_executive_officer" title="wikilink">CEO</a> <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#John_Hammond" title="wikilink">John Hammond</a> is pressured by his investors to allow a safety investigation by experts before opening the park. He invites Drs. <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Dr._Alan_Grant" title="wikilink">Alan Grant</a> and <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Dr._Ellie_Sattler" title="wikilink">Ellie Sattler</a>, as well as <a href="chaos_theory" title="wikilink">chaos theorist</a> <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Dr._Ian_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Dr. Ian Malcolm</a> and his investors' attorney <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Donald_Gennaro" title="wikilink">Donald Gennaro</a>, to perform the inspection. At the park, they learn that InGen recreated the dinosaurs by cloning genetic material found in <a href="mosquito" title="wikilink">mosquitoes</a> that fed on dinosaur blood, preserved in <a href="Dominican_amber" title="wikilink">Dominican amber</a>. The DNA from these samples was spliced with DNA from <a href="frog" title="wikilink">frogs</a> to fill in gaps: during this process, the <a href="dinosaurs" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinosaurs</a> are bred as females to control the population. The team are also shown the pen containing the ferocious and intelligent adults.</p>
<p><img src="JurassicParkTREX.jpg" title="fig:The Tyrannosaurus escapes from her paddock." alt="The Tyrannosaurus escapes from her paddock." width="200" /> Malcolm and Sattler are concerned, but Grant remains neutral. They meet Hammond's grandchildren, <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Alexis_&quot;Lex&quot;_Murphy" title="wikilink">Alexis</a> and <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Timothy_&quot;Tim&quot;_Murphy" title="wikilink">Tim Murphy</a>, and go on a vehicular tour of the park. Ellie leaves the tour to take care of a sick <em><a href="Triceratops" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triceratops</a></em>. A storm hits the island and most InGen employees leave, except for Hammond, <a href="game_warden" title="wikilink">game warden</a> <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Robert_Muldoon" title="wikilink">Robert Muldoon</a>, chief <a href="Systems_engineering" title="wikilink">engineer</a> <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#John_Raymond_Arnold" title="wikilink">Ray Arnold</a>, and lead <a href="computer_programmer" title="wikilink">computer programmer</a> <a href="List_of_characters_in_Jurassic_Park#Dennis_Nedry" title="wikilink">Dennis Nedry</a>. Commissioned by rival businessman <a href="Biosyn" title="wikilink">Lewis Dodgson</a>, Nedry takes an opportunity to shut down the park's security system so he can steal dinosaur <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> and deliver them to an auxiliary dock. Thus, a <em><a href="Tyrannosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyrannosaurus</a></em> breaks through the electric fence surrounding its pen, killing Gennaro, wounding Malcolm and then attacks Tim and Lex hiding in the car. The children and Grant only narrowly avoid being killed and eaten. Meanwhile, Ellie and Muldoon rescue Malcolm and are almost caught by the <em>T. rex</em> during an intense chase. Nedry crashes his car and after trying to fix it is killed by a <em><a href="Dilophosaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dilophosaurus</a></em>. Grant, Tim, and Lex spend the night in a tree and while hiking to safety the next morning discover some of the dinosaurs are actually breeding. Grant realizes that the frog DNA is responsible, as some species of frog are known to spontaneously change gender in a single-sex environment.</p>
<p><img src="JPvelociraptor.png" title="fig:A pair of Velociraptor enter the kitchen." alt="A pair of Velociraptor enter the kitchen." width="200" /> Arnold tries to hack Nedry&lt;U+2019&gt;s computer to turn the power back on and fails, so he leaves to turn it back on manually. Ellie and Muldoon follow after he fails to return and discover the raptors have escaped. Muldoon tells Ellie to go to the utility shed herself and turn the power back on while he hunts the raptors that have been stalking them. Muldoon is attacked and killed by a lurking raptor while Ellie escapes from another after discovering Arnold's remains. After managing to turn on the power and escaping the raptor, she meets up with Grant. They both go back to Malcolm and Hammond, and Grant grabs a shotgun after learning that two raptors have escaped their pen and a third has been contained. Lex and Tim narrowly escape two of the raptors in the kitchen and, using her computer skills, Lex reboots the mainframe in order to call Hammond to get a helicopter while Grant and Ellie hold off a raptor trying to open the door to the computer room. After a scuffle on top of the fossil exhibits where the raptors block their escape route, the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> suddenly barges in and kills both raptors. Grant, Ellie, Lex and Tim climb into Hammond and Malcolm's jeep and leave. Grant says he will not endorse the park, a choice with which Hammond concurs. Flying away in the helicopter, the children fall asleep beside Grant, who contemplatively watches the birds flying nearby, the surviving relatives of the dinosaurs they escaped. </p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p><a href="Michael_Crichton" title="wikilink">Michael Crichton</a> originally conceived a screenplay about a boy who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel <em><a href="Jurassic_Park" title="wikilink">Jurassic Park</a></em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the TV series <em><a href="ER_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">E.R.</a></em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Before the book was published, Crichton put up a non-negotiable fee for $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> and <a href="Tim_Burton" title="wikilink">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="Columbia_Tristar" title="wikilink">Columbia Tristar</a> and <a href="Richard_Donner" title="wikilink">Richard Donner</a>, and <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a> and <a href="Joe_Dante" title="wikilink">Joe Dante</a> bid for the rights,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> but Universal eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Universal further paid Crichton $500,000 to adapt his own novel,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> which he finished by the time Spielberg was filming <em><a href="Hook_(film)" title="wikilink">Hook</a></em>. Crichton noted that, because the book was &quot;fairly long&quot;, his script only had about 10&lt;U+2013&gt;20 percent of the content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Concurrently, Spielberg hired <a href="Stan_Winston" title="wikilink">Stan Winston</a> to create the animatronic dinosaurs, <a href="Phil_Tippett" title="wikilink">Phil Tippett</a> to create <a href="go_motion" title="wikilink">go motion</a> dinosaurs for longshots, and <a href="Michael_Lantieri" title="wikilink">Michael Lantieri</a> and <a href="Dennis_Muren" title="wikilink">Dennis Muren</a> to supervise the on-set effects and digital compositing respectively. Paleontologist <a href="Jack_Horner_(paleontologist)" title="wikilink">Jack Horner</a> supervised the designs, to help commit to Spielberg's desire of portraying the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. Horner dismissed the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> complaining, &quot;[The dinosaurs] have no way of doing that!&quot; Based on Horner's complaint, Spielberg insisted that Tippett take the tongues out.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <img src="ClayRex.jpg" title="fig:A go motion test of the Tyrannosaurus by Phil Tippett" alt="A go motion test of the Tyrannosaurus by Phil Tippett" width="250" /> After completing <em>Hook</em>, Spielberg wanted to film <em><a href="Schindler&#39;s_List" title="wikilink">Schindler's List</a></em>. <a href="Music_Corporation_of_America" title="wikilink">MCA</a> president <a href="Sid_Sheinberg" title="wikilink">Sid Sheinberg</a> greenlit the film on one condition: that Spielberg make <em>Jurassic Park</em> first. Spielberg later said, &quot;He knew that once I had directed <em>Schindler</em> I wouldn't be able to do <em>Jurassic Park</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Beginning October 1991, <a href="Malia_Scotch_Marmo" title="wikilink">Malia Scotch Marmo</a> rewrote the script from scratch over a five month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs, before molding <a href="latex" class="uri" title="wikilink">latex</a> skins, which were folded over onto complex robotics.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Tippett created stop-motion animatics of major scenes, but, despite go-motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a <a href="live-action" class="uri" title="wikilink">live-action</a> feature film.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Animators Mark Dippe and Steve Williams went ahead in creating a computer generated walk cycle for the <em>T. rex</em> skeleton and were approved to do more.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the <em>T. rex</em> chasing a herd of <em>Gallimimus</em>, Spielberg said, &quot;You're out of a job,&quot; to which Tippett replied, &quot;Don't you mean extinct?&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Spielberg later wrote both the animatic and his dialogue between him and Tippett into the script.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Screenwriter <a href="David_Koepp" title="wikilink">David Koepp</a> came on board afterward, starting afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Spielberg also excised a sub-plot of <em><a href="Procompsognathus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procompsognathus</a></em> escaping to the mainland and attacking young children, as he found it too horrific.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In terms of characterization, Hammond was changed from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, as Spielberg admitted he identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged 11 and into computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and into sports.

<li><strong><em><a href="Velociraptor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Velociraptor</a></em></strong>, dubbed 'raptors' in the film, also have a major role, although those depicted are not based on the actual species in question, which is significantly smaller. It was instead based on its larger relative, <em><a href="Deinonychus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deinonychus</a></em>, which was at the time called <em>Velociraptor antirrhopus</em> by some scientists.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Crichton followed this theory, but by the time production of the film took place, the idea had been dropped.

<li><strong><em><a href="Triceratops" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triceratops</a></em></strong> has an extended cameo. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg requested to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Winston also created a baby <em>Triceratops</em> for Ariana Richards to ride, which was cut from the film for pacing reasons.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></li>

<p>The film received modestly positive reviews.
