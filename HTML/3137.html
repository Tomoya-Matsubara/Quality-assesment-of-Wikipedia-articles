<p><strong>Neptune</strong> is the eighth and farthest <a href="planet" class="uri" title="wikilink">planet</a> from the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a> in our <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a>. Named for the <a href="Neptune_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Roman god of the sea</a>, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Neptune is 17 times the mass of <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> and is slightly more massive than its near-twin <a href="Uranus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranus</a>, which is 15 Earth masses and not as dense.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On average, Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of 30.1 <a href="Astronomical_Unit" title="wikilink">AU</a>, approximately 30 times the Earth-Sun distance. Its <a href="astronomical_symbol" title="wikilink">astronomical symbol</a> is <img src="Neptune_symbol.svg" title="fig:Astronomical symbol for Neptune." alt="Astronomical symbol for Neptune." width="20" />, a stylized version of the god Neptune's <a href="trident" class="uri" title="wikilink">trident</a>.</p>
<p>Discovered on September 23, 1846,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by <a href="empirical_observation" title="wikilink">empirical observation</a>. Unexpected changes in the orbit of <a href="Uranus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranus</a> led <a href="Alexis_Bouvard" title="wikilink">Alexis Bouvard</a> to deduce that its orbit was subject to <a href="gravitation" title="wikilink">gravitational</a> <a href="perturbation_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">perturbation</a> by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed by <a href="Johann_Galle" title="wikilink">Johann Galle</a> within a degree of the position predicted by <a href="Urbain_Le_Verrier" title="wikilink">Urbain Le Verrier</a>, and its largest moon, <a href="Triton_(moon)" title="wikilink">Triton</a>, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 12 <a href="Moons_of_Neptune" title="wikilink">moons</a> were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, <em><a href="Voyager_2" title="wikilink">Voyager 2</a></em>, which flew by the planet on August 25, 1989.</p>
<p>Neptune is similar in composition to <a href="Uranus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranus</a>, and both have compositions which differ from those of the larger <a href="gas_giant" title="wikilink">gas giants</a> <a href="Jupiter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saturn</a>. Neptune's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in that it is composed primarily of <a href="hydrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium" class="uri" title="wikilink">helium</a>, along with traces of <a href="hydrocarbon" title="wikilink">hydrocarbons</a> and possibly <a href="nitrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a>, contains a higher proportion of &quot;ices&quot; such as water, <a href="ammonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammonia</a> and <a href="methane" class="uri" title="wikilink">methane</a>. Astronomers sometimes categorize Uranus and Neptune as &quot;<a href="ice_giant" title="wikilink">ice giants</a>&quot; in order to emphasize these distinctions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast to the relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere is notable for its active and visible weather patterns. At the time of the 1989 <em>Voyager 2</em> <a href="planetary_flyby" title="wikilink">flyby</a>, for example, the planet's southern hemisphere possessed a <a href="Great_Dark_Spot" title="wikilink">Great Dark Spot</a> comparable to the <a href="Great_Red_Spot" title="wikilink">Great Red Spot</a> on <a href="Jupiter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching  . Temperatures at the planet's centre, however, are approximately .<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Neptune has a faint and fragmented <a href="planetary_ring" title="wikilink">ring system</a>, which may have been detected during the 1960s but was only indisputably confirmed in 1989 by <em>Voyager 2</em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>

<p><a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo's</a> drawings show that he first observed Neptune on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613. On both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a <a href="fixed_star" title="wikilink">fixed star</a> when it appeared very close&lt;U+2014&gt;in <a href="Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)" title="wikilink">conjunction</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;to Jupiter in the <a href="night_sky" title="wikilink">night sky</a>;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. During the period of his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was stationary in the sky because it had just turned <a href="Retrograde_and_direct_motion" title="wikilink">retrograde</a> that very day. This apparent backward motion is created when the orbit of the Earth takes it past an outer planet. Since Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small <a href="telescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">telescope</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, in July 2009 <a href="University_of_Melbourne" title="wikilink">University of Melbourne</a> physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the star he had observed had moved relative to the <a href="fixed_stars" title="wikilink">fixed stars</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1821, <a href="Alexis_Bouvard" title="wikilink">Alexis Bouvard</a> published astronomical tables of the <a href="orbit" class="uri" title="wikilink">orbit</a> of Neptune's neighbor Uranus.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize that an unknown body was <a href="Perturbation_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">perturbing</a> the orbit through <a href="gravitation" title="wikilink">gravitational</a> interaction.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1843, <a href="John_Couch_Adams" title="wikilink">John Couch Adams</a> calculated the orbit of a hypothesized eighth planet that would account for Uranus's motion. He sent his calculations to Sir <a href="George_Biddell_Airy" title="wikilink">George Airy</a>, the <a href="Astronomer_Royal" title="wikilink">Astronomer Royal</a>, who asked Adams for a clarification. Adams began to draft a reply but never sent it and did not aggressively pursue work on the Uranus problem.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Urbain_Le_Verrier.jpg" title="fig:|Urbain Le Verrier" alt="|Urbain Le Verrier" /> In 1845&lt;U+2013&gt;46, <a href="Urbain_Le_Verrier" title="wikilink">Urbain Le Verrier</a>, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but also experienced difficulties in stimulating any enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June, however, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded <a href="Cambridge_Observatory" title="wikilink">Cambridge Observatory</a> director <a href="James_Challis" title="wikilink">James Challis</a> to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Meantime, Le Verrier by letter urged <a href="Berlin_Observatory" title="wikilink">Berlin Observatory</a> astronomer <a href="Johann_Gottfried_Galle" title="wikilink">Johann Gottfried Galle</a> to search with the observatory's <a href="refractor" class="uri" title="wikilink">refractor</a>. <a href="Heinrich_Louis_d&#39;Arrest" title="wikilink">Heinrich d'Arrest</a>, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a <a href="planet" class="uri" title="wikilink">planet</a>, as opposed to a fixed star. The very evening of the day of receipt of Le Verrier's letter on September 23, 1846, Neptune was discovered within 1&lt;U+00B0&gt; of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 12&lt;U+00B0&gt; from Adams' prediction. Challis later realized that he had observed the planet twice in August, failing to identify it owing to his casual approach to the work.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In the wake of the discovery, there was much nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who had priority and deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually an international consensus emerged that both Le Verrier and Adams jointly deserved credit. However, the issue is being re-evaluated by historians with the rediscovery in 1998 of the &quot;Neptune papers&quot; (historical documents from the <a href="Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich" title="wikilink">Royal Observatory, Greenwich</a>), which had apparently been stolen by astronomer <a href="Olin_J._Eggen" title="wikilink">Olin J. Eggen</a> and hoarded for nearly three decades, not to be rediscovered (in his possession) until immediately after his death.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After reviewing the documents, some historians suggest that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier. Since 1966 <a href="Dennis_Rawlins" title="wikilink">Dennis Rawlins</a> has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery. In a 1992 article in his journal <em>Dio</em> he deemed the British claim &quot;theft&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> &quot;Adams had done some calculations but he was rather unsure about quite where he was saying Neptune was,&quot; said <a href="Nicholas_Kollerstrom" title="wikilink">Nicholas Kollerstrom</a> of <a href="University_College_London" title="wikilink">University College London</a> in 2003.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
<p>Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as &quot;the planet exterior to Uranus&quot; or as &quot;Le Verrier's planet&quot;. The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name <em><a href="Janus_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Janus</a></em>. In England, Challis put forward the name <em><a href="Oceanus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oceanus</a></em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Claiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name <em>Neptune</em> for this new planet, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French <a href="Bureau_des_Longitudes" title="wikilink">Bureau des Longitudes</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In October, he sought to name the planet <em>Le Verrier</em>, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Arago" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Arago</a>. However, this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name <em>Herschel</em> for <em>Uranus</em>, after that planet's discoverer Sir <a href="William_Herschel" title="wikilink">William Herschel</a>, and <em>Leverrier</em> for the new planet.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_von_Struve" title="wikilink">Struve</a> came out in favour of the name <em>Neptune</em> on December 29, 1846, to the <a href="Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Soon <em>Neptune</em> became the internationally accepted name. In <a href="Roman_mythology" title="wikilink">Roman mythology</a>, <a href="Neptune_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Neptune</a> was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek <a href="Poseidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poseidon</a>. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman_mythology" title="wikilink">Roman mythology</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Most languages today, even in countries that have no direct link to Graeco-Roman culture, use some variant of the name &quot;Neptune&quot; for the planet; however, in <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>, <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> and <a href="Korean_language" title="wikilink">Korean</a>, the planet's name was literally translated as &quot;sea king star&quot; (&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+738B&gt;&lt;U+661F&gt;), since Neptune was the god of the sea.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p>From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent <a href="discovery_of_Pluto" title="wikilink">discovery</a> of <a href="Pluto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pluto</a> in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. Upon Pluto's discovery Neptune became the penultimate planet, save for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer to the sun than Neptune.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> However, the discovery of the <a href="Kuiper_belt" title="wikilink">Kuiper belt</a> in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet in its own right or part of the belt's larger structure.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 2006, the <a href="International_Astronomical_Union" title="wikilink">International Astronomical Union</a> <a href="2006_definition_of_planet" title="wikilink">defined the word &quot;planet&quot; for the first time</a>, reclassifying Pluto as a &quot;<a href="dwarf_planet" title="wikilink">dwarf planet</a>&quot; and making Neptune once again the last planet in the Solar System.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Neptune's internal structure resembles that of <a href="Uranus#Internal_structure" title="wikilink">Uranus</a>. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10 percent of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 <a href="Pascal_(unit)" title="wikilink">GPa</a>. Increasing concentrations of <a href="methane" class="uri" title="wikilink">methane</a>, <a href="ammonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammonia</a> and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <img src="Neptune_diagram.svg" title="fig: The internal structure of Neptune: 1.

<h3 id="magnetosphere">Magnetosphere</h3>
<p>Neptune also resembles Uranus in its <a href="magnetosphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">magnetosphere</a>, with a <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> strongly tilted relative to its <a href="rotation" title="wikilink">rotational</a> axis at 47&lt;U+00B0&gt; and offset at least 0.55 radii, or about 13500 km from the planet's physical centre. Before <em>Voyager 2</em>'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. However, in comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by <a href="convection" title="wikilink">convective</a> fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of <a href="Electrical_conductor" title="wikilink">electrically conducting</a> liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> resulting in a <a href="dynamo" class="uri" title="wikilink">dynamo</a> action.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 <a href="Tesla_(unit)" title="wikilink">microteslas</a> (0.14 <a href="Gauss_(unit)" title="wikilink">G</a>).<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The dipole <a href="magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">magnetic moment</a> of Neptune is about 2.2 T&lt;U+00B7&gt;m<sup>3</sup> (14 &lt;U+03BC&gt;T&lt;U+00B7&gt;<em>R</em><sub><em>N</em></sub><sup>3</sup>, where <em>R</em><sub><em>N</em></sub> is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong <a href="quadrupole" class="uri" title="wikilink">quadrupole</a> moment that may exceed the <a href="Magnetic_dipole_moment" title="wikilink">dipole moment</a> in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of offset from the planet's center and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Neptune's <a href="bow_shock" title="wikilink">bow shock</a>, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the <a href="solar_wind" title="wikilink">solar wind</a>, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The <a href="magnetopause" class="uri" title="wikilink">magnetopause</a>, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23&lt;U+2013&gt;26.5 times the radius of Neptune.

<h3 id="planetary-rings">Planetary rings</h3>

<p><img src="neptunerings.jpg" title="fig:Neptune&#39;s rings, taken by Voyager 2" alt="Neptune&#39;s rings, taken by Voyager 2" /> Neptune has a <a href="planetary_ring" title="wikilink">planetary ring</a> system, though one much less substantial than that of <a href="Rings_of_Saturn" title="wikilink">Saturn</a>. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63000 km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57000 km.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The first of these planetary rings was discovered in 1968 by a team led by <a href="Edward_Guinan" title="wikilink">Edward Guinan</a>,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> but it was later thought that this ring might be incomplete.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Evidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a <a href="occultation" title="wikilink">stellar occultation</a> in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Images by <em>Voyager 2</em> in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings. These rings have a clumpy structure,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> the cause of which is not currently understood but which may be due to the gravitational interaction with small moons in orbit near them.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named <em>Courage</em>, <em>Libert&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, <em>Egalit&lt;U+00E9&gt; 1</em>, <em>Egalit&lt;U+00E9&gt; 2</em> and <em>Fraternit&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over very short timescales. Astronomers now believe that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of <a href="Galatea_(moon)" title="wikilink">Galatea</a>, a moon just inward from the ring.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Earth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the <a href="W._M._Keck_Observatory" title="wikilink">W. M. Keck Observatory</a> in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by <em>Voyager 2</em>. In particular, it seems that the <em>Libert&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> arc might disappear in as little as one century.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
<p>One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the typical level of meteorological activity. When the <em>Voyager 2</em> spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986, that planet was visually quite bland. In contrast Neptune exhibited notable weather phenomena during the 1989 <em>Voyager 2</em> fly-by.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> <img src="Neptune_storms.jpg" title="fig:The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud), and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated." alt="The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud), and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated." /></p>
<p>Neptune's weather is characterized by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s&lt;U+2014&gt;nearly attaining <a href="supersonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">supersonic</a> flow.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is believed to be a &quot;skin effect&quot; and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> At 70&lt;U+00B0&gt; S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>The abundance of methane, ethane and <a href="ethyne" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethyne</a> at Neptune's equator is 10&lt;U+2013&gt;100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007 it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C warmer than the rest of Neptune, which averages approximately .<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The warmth differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere lies frozen in Neptune's upper atmosphere, leak out as gas through the south pole and into space. The relative &quot;hot spot&quot; is due to Neptune's <a href="axial_tilt" title="wikilink">axial tilt</a>, which has exposed the south pole to the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a> for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 and is expected to last until about 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="storms">Storms</h3>
<p><img src="Neptune&#39;s_Great_Dark_Spot.jpg" title="fig:The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2" alt="The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2" /> In 1989, the <a href="Great_Dark_Spot" title="wikilink">Great Dark Spot</a>, an <a href="anticyclone" title="wikilink">anti-cyclonic</a> storm system spanning 13000&lt;U+00D7&gt;6600 km,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> was discovered by <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a>'s <em>Voyager 2</em> spacecraft. The storm resembled the <a href="Great_Red_Spot" title="wikilink">Great Red Spot</a> of Jupiter. Some five years later, however, on November 2, 1994, the <a href="Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble Space Telescope</a> did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname is due to the fact that when first detected in the months before the 1989 <em>Voyager 2</em> encounter it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Subsequent images revealed even faster clouds. The <a href="Small_Dark_Spot" title="wikilink">Small Dark Spot</a> is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It initially was completely dark, but as <em>Voyager 2</em> approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Neptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the <a href="troposphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">troposphere</a> at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be <a href="vortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">vortex</a> structures.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the <a href="tropopause" class="uri" title="wikilink">tropopause</a> layer.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="internal-heat">Internal heat</h3>
<p>Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is believed to be due in part to its higher internal heat.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Although Neptune lies half again as far from the Sun as Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> of .

As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> while Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Several possible explanations have been suggested, including <a href="radiogenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiogenic</a> heating from the planet's core,<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> conversion of methane under high pressure into hydrogen, <a href="diamond" class="uri" title="wikilink">diamond</a> and longer <a href="hydrocarbon" title="wikilink">hydrocarbons</a> (the hydrogen and diamond would then rise and sink, respectively, releasing <a href="gravitational_potential_energy" title="wikilink">gravitational potential energy</a>),<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> and <a href="convection" class="uri" title="wikilink">convection</a> in the lower atmosphere that causes <a href="gravity_wave" title="wikilink">gravity waves</a> to break above the tropopause.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="orbit-and-rotation">Orbit and rotation</h2>
<p>The average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.50 billion km (about 30.1 AU), and it completes an orbit every 164.79 years. On July 12, 2011, Neptune will have completed the first full orbit since its discovery in 1846,<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> although it will not appear at its exact discovery position in our sky because the Earth will be in a different location in its 365.25-day orbit.</p>
<p>The elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77&lt;U+00B0&gt; compared to the Earth. Because of an <a href="orbital_eccentricity" title="wikilink">eccentricity</a> of 0.011, the distance between Neptune and the Sun varies by 101 million km between <a href="perihelion" class="uri" title="wikilink">perihelion</a> and <a href="aphelion" class="uri" title="wikilink">aphelion</a>, the nearest and most distant points of the planet from the Sun along the orbital path, respectively.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32&lt;U+00B0&gt;,<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23&lt;U+00B0&gt;) and Mars (25&lt;U+00B0&gt;). As a result, this planet experiences similar seasonal changes. However, the long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11 hours.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Since its axial tilt is comparable to the Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.</p>
<p>Because Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes <a href="differential_rotation" title="wikilink">differential rotation</a>. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="orbital-resonances">Orbital resonances</h3>

<p><img src="TheKuiperBelt_classes-en.svg" title="fig: A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant &quot;classical belt&quot; (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos)." alt=" A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant &quot;classical belt&quot; (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos)." width="250" /> Neptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the <a href="asteroid_belt" title="wikilink">asteroid belt</a> but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the <a href="asteroid_belt" title="wikilink">asteroid belt</a>, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the <a href="Kuiper_belt" title="wikilink">Kuiper belt</a>. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt become destabilized by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>There do, however, exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These <a href="Orbital_resonance" title="wikilink">resonances</a> occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as <a href="plutino" title="wikilink">plutinos</a> because the largest of the Kuiper belt objects, <a href="Pluto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pluto</a>, is among them.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>Neptune possesses a number of <a href="Trojan_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">trojan objects</a> occupying the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a>-Neptune  <a href="Lagrangian_point" title="wikilink">Lagrangian point</a>&lt;U+2014&gt; a gravitationally stable region leading it in its orbit.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> <a href="Neptune_trojan" title="wikilink">Neptune trojans</a> can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune.

Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core <a href="Accretion_(astrophysics)" title="wikilink">accretion</a>, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their creation. One is that the ice giants were not created by core accretion but from instabilities within the original <a href="protoplanetary_disc" title="wikilink">protoplanetary disc</a>, and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive <a href="OB_star" title="wikilink">OB star</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>An alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently <a href="Planetary_migration" title="wikilink">migrated</a> to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> This hypothesis of migration after formation is currently favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> The current most widely accepted<ref name="Crida2009"></p>

<p>Neptune has 13 known <a href="natural_satellite" title="wikilink">moons</a>.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> The largest by far, comprising more than 99.5 percent of the mass in orbit around Neptune<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> and the only one massive enough to be <a href="spheroid" title="wikilink">spheroidal</a>, is <a href="Triton_(moon)" title="wikilink">Triton</a>, discovered by <a href="William_Lassell" title="wikilink">William Lassell</a> just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a <a href="retrograde_orbit" title="wikilink">retrograde orbit</a>, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it probably was once a <a href="dwarf_planet" title="wikilink">dwarf planet</a> in the Kuiper belt.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a <a href="synchronous_rotation" title="wikilink">synchronous rotation</a>, and it is slowly spiraling inward because of <a href="tidal_acceleration" title="wikilink">tidal acceleration</a> and eventually will be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the <a href="Roche_limit" title="wikilink">Roche limit</a>.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the solar system,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> with estimated temperatures of .<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>Neptune's second known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon <a href="Nereid_(moon)" title="wikilink">Nereid</a>, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an <a href="apoapsis" class="uri" title="wikilink">apoapsis</a> that is seven times its <a href="periapsis" class="uri" title="wikilink">periapsis</a> distance from Neptune.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Proteus_(Voyager_2).jpg" title="fig:Neptune&#39;s moon Proteus" alt="Neptune&#39;s moon Proteus" /> From July to September 1989, <em>Voyager 2</em> discovered six new Neptunian moons.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Of these, the irregularly shaped <a href="Proteus_(moon)" title="wikilink">Proteus</a> is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only one-quarter of one percent the mass of Triton.

The next-farthest out, <a href="Larissa_(moon)" title="wikilink">Larissa</a>, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when <em>Voyager 2</em> observed Neptune in 1989, it was found to have been caused by the moon. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>Neptune is never visible to the <a href="naked_eye" title="wikilink">naked eye</a>, having a brightness between <a href="Apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">magnitudes</a> +7.7 and +8.0,<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> which can be outshone by Jupiter's <a href="Galilean_moons" title="wikilink">Galilean moons</a>, the <a href="dwarf_planet" title="wikilink">dwarf planet</a> <a href="Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" title="wikilink">Ceres</a> and the <a href="asteroid" title="wikilink">asteroids</a> <a href="4_Vesta" title="wikilink">4 Vesta</a>, <a href="2_Pallas" title="wikilink">2 Pallas</a>, <a href="7_Iris" title="wikilink">7 Iris</a>, <a href="3_Juno" title="wikilink">3 Juno</a> and <a href="6_Hebe" title="wikilink">6 Hebe</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the distance of Neptune from the Earth, the <a href="angular_diameter" title="wikilink">angular diameter</a> of the planet only ranges from 2.2&lt;U+2013&gt;2.4 <a href="arcsecond" title="wikilink">arcseconds</a>;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size has made it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of <a href="Hubble_Space_Telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and large ground-based telescopes with <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>From the Earth, Neptune goes through apparent <a href="Retrograde_and_direct_motion" title="wikilink">retrograde motion</a> every 367 days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each <a href="Opposition_(astronomy_and_astrology)" title="wikilink">opposition</a>. These loops will carry it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and in October and November 2011.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>Observation of Neptune in the <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> frequency band shows that the planet is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are believed to originate from the planet's rotating magnetic field.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> In the <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a> part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>

<p><img src="SunsetNeptune.png" title="fig:Illustration of Voyager 2 passing Neptune in 1989." alt="Illustration of Voyager 2 passing Neptune in 1989." /> <em><a href="Voyager_2" title="wikilink">Voyager 2</a></em>'s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Since this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for <em><a href="Voyager_1" title="wikilink">Voyager 1</a></em>'s encounter with <a href="Saturn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saturn</a> and its moon <a href="Titan_(moon)" title="wikilink">Titan</a>. The images relayed back to Earth from <em>Voyager 2</em> became the basis of a 1989 <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">PBS</a> all-night program, <em>Neptune All Night</em>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_(large).jpg" title="fig:A Voyager 2 mosaic of Triton" alt="A Voyager 2 mosaic of Triton" /> During the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246 minutes to reach the Earth. Hence, for the most part, the <em>Voyager 2</em> mission relied on pre-loaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon <a href="Nereid_(moon)" title="wikilink">Nereid</a> before it came within 4400 km of Neptune's atmosphere on August 25, then passed close to the planet's largest moon <a href="Triton_(moon)" title="wikilink">Triton</a> later the same day.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>The spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. The question of the planet's rotation period was settled using measurements of radio emissions. <em>Voyager 2</em> also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a><a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, there was a proposal to <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a>'s &quot;Vision Missions Studies&quot; to implement a &quot;<a href="Neptune_Orbiter" title="wikilink">Neptune Orbiter with Probes</a>&quot; mission that does <em><a href="Cassini&lt;U+2013&gt;Huygens" title="wikilink">Cassini</a></em>-level science without fission-based electric power or propulsion. The work is being done in conjunction with <a href="Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory" title="wikilink">JPL</a> and the <a href="California_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">California Institute of Technology</a>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
