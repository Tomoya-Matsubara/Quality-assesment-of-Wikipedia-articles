<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1851 Werner Trimborn and Jacob Kier purchased an existing <a href="Lime_(mineral)" title="wikilink">lime</a> production business which covered ten acres on site. Kier left soon after, but Werner and his family continued on to become one of the largest producers of high quality lime in Wisconsin. At its height in the 1870s, the business held over 500 acres (2 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of land and employed nearly 40 people.</p>
<p>With the 1900s came a drastic change in building materials, including the introduction of <a href="Portland_cement" title="wikilink">Portland cement</a>. The estate was soon subdivided and sold off, with much of it going to the Theodore Vollmer family for use in dairy farming. In 1919 the Froemming family purchased a large tract of land to build greenhouses on, a portion of which was later donated to Whitnall Park.</p>
<p>In 1935 the farm, along with 3,400 acres (14 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of surrounding land, was purchased by the federal government as part of a planned agricultural community known as the Greendale Project. (See &quot;Greenbelt towns,&quot; <a href="Greendale,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Greendale, Wisconsin</a>.)</p>
<p>After the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, the remaining farmland passed in to private ownership where it became home to crop dusters and a riding stable.</p>
