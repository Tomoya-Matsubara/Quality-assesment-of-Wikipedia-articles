<th><p>ShortSummary=Takaya Murase purchases a maid android. When she arrives she is naked except for a ribbon. Takaya removes it and attempts to dress her up in different outfits to satisfy his <a href="clothing_fetish" title="wikilink">clothing fetish</a>. The android claims that Takaya is abusing her and not treating her like a maid. When he persists, she reacts by knocking him out with a punch and disposes of Takaya's figurine collection while he is under. When Takaya finds out what she has done, the android runs away back to the android store. Takaya chases after her and apologizes for his behavior. He then names her Yui. Yui is touched, however, when they return to Takaya's apartment, she finds out that Takaya has filled the room with figurines from his reserve collection.</p>
<p>Yui gets Takaya to take her out of the house, believing that he cannot treat her like a doll in public. Nearby, they see a woman in a revealing costume, trying to comfort a lost little girl. Two passing <a href="miko" title="wikilink">mikos</a>, Sumire and Ran Midou, accuse the woman of indecent behavior and punish her by summoning a giant octopus to assault her. Meanwhile Takaya comforts the girl, learning that she is Ayumi Hagiwara and is upset because she cannot find the &quot;lost child&quot; that is her mother. The costumed woman introduces herself as Minori Sumitomo and invites them all to her father Tetsushi's cafe, Cafe Cowbeya. Takeshi and Takaya immediately hit it off and challenge each other to a dress-up contest, using Minori and Yui as models. There, Ayumi reunites with her mother, Kanae, who is attracted by the competition and winds up joining in. Due to the presence of Kanae and Yui, the shop is packed with customers. Takaya volunteers himself and Yui to help out.</p>
<p>Minori is looking after a baby boy for her relatives while they are moving, but her father calls her back to help out at the cafe. Yui volunteers to look after the baby. With Takaya out shopping, she has to look after the baby by herself. Rummaging through Takaya's closet for something to get the baby to stop crying, Yui finds adult-sized baby clothes and changes into them. The baby suckles at Yui's uncovered breast, but her robot breasts do not produce milk, so she gives the baby a bottle. While changing him, Yui becomes fascinated by the baby's penis, calling it a &quot;little elephant&quot;. Both Takeya and Minori are scandalized by Yui's clothes when they return, but she tells them it is an official baby-sitter's outfit. }} {{Japanese episode list multi-part</p></th>

<th><p>ShortSummary=Takaya and Yui are helping out at Cafe Cowbeya when Kuon comes by to pick up a take-out order. Yui thinks she must be the daughter of a well-to-do family, but Minori can tell that she is an android because her eyes look like the eyes of an anime character. Kuon introduces herself to Yui and says she has heard so much about her from the android shop owner. At first, Kuon takes pity on Yui, supposing her to be abandoned, but when she realizes that Yui is working at the cafe under Takaya's direction, Kuon becomes jealous and insecure: she still has no master because no one has bought her. To prove her worth as a maid, Kuon enters and wins a robot maid competition. Yui also competes but does poorly.</p>
<p>Takaya takes Yui to the beach to cheer her up after her loss. Minori, Ayumi and Kanae all compete for Takaya's attention, but he only pays attention to Yui. Yui is too proud to admit that she can't swim and demonstrates her ability to walk on water, but she overheats her groin from moving her legs so rapidly and causes her bathing suit to catch fire. Even after Takaya teaches her to swim, Yui yells at him and says he should not make assumptions about what she would enjoy. After an interlude in the bath, where Kanae speaks fondly of her dead husband, Yui returns to Takaya and reconciles with him.</p>
<p>A strange girl rushes into the cafe, calls Takaya by name and hugs him affectionately. Takaya recognizes Sakuya, a customized figurine from the collection that Yui threw away. Sakuya is actually a new product from the MP android company, based on data collected by a chip embedded in the figurine. Sakuya begins reminiscing about Takuya's solo activities ('secret activities' in the English version), but Takuya is embarrassed and quickly runs out of the shop with her. Back at his home, Sakuya tells Takuya how much she is looking forward to having him do the same things to her that he used to do to her figurine. Yui wakes from about nightmare about this, and asks Takaya why he hasn't customized her. Takaya tells Yui that he likes her just the way she is. }} {{Japanese episode list multi-part</p></th>

Yui awakes, but pretends to still be asleep, afraid that Takaya will leave her if she gets up. Only when Takaya gets up to go the strange women does Yui rouse, grabbing his sleeve once again. }}</p></th>
