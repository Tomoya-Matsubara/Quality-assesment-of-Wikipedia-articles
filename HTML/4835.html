<p>&quot;<strong>Lisa the Skeptic</strong>&quot; is the eighth episode of <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>' <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_9)" title="wikilink">ninth season</a>, first aired on November 23, 1997. On an <a href="Archaeology" title="wikilink">archaeological</a> dig with her class, <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> discovers a skeleton that resembles an <a href="angel" class="uri" title="wikilink">angel</a>. All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel, but <a href="skepticism" title="wikilink">skeptical</a> Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a <a href="rational_skepticism" title="wikilink">rational scientific</a> explanation. The episode's writer <a href="David_X._Cohen" title="wikilink">David X. Cohen</a> developed the idea after visiting the <a href="American_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="wikilink">American Museum of Natural History</a>, and decided to loosely parallel themes from the <a href="Scopes_Trial" title="wikilink">Scopes Monkey Trial</a>. There were mixed reviews.</p>
<p>It has been discussed in the context of <a href="virtual_reality" title="wikilink">virtual reality</a>, <a href="ontology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ontology</a>, <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a>, and skepticism; it has also been used in Christian religious education classes to initiate discussion about angels, skepticism, science, and faith.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> attempts to claim a <a href="motorboat" class="uri" title="wikilink">motorboat</a> from a &quot;police raffle&quot; that turns out to be a <a href="sting_operation" title="wikilink">sting operation</a>. While returning home, the family passes a new mall in Springfield is being built on an area where a large number of <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a> were found. Lisa protests strongly, which prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. During the excavations, Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an angel, and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage. Lisa remains skeptical, and asks <a href="Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="wikilink">Stephen Jay Gould</a> to test a sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on <a href="television" title="wikilink">TV</a> to compare the belief in angels to the belief in <a href="unicorn" title="wikilink">unicorns</a> and <a href="leprechaun" title="wikilink">leprechauns</a> (news anchor Brockman states that leprechauns are extinct). In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions (including, ironically, a <a href="Christian_Science" title="wikilink">Christian Science</a> library). Appalled by the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household, and Lisa is promptly arrested and put on trial for stealing the skeleton.</p>
<p>Before the trial begins, the courtroom's attention is diverted when the skeleton appears outside, carrying a foreboding message that &quot;<a href="Apocalypse" title="wikilink">The End</a>&quot; will come at sundown. Meanwhile, <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_from_the_Simpsons#Judge_Roy_Snyder" title="wikilink">Judge Snyder</a> issues a <a href="injunction" title="wikilink">restraining order</a> to keep science and religion  apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield's citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. As Lisa starts to reprimand them, the skeleton suddenly silences her and yells &quot;Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!&quot; and is hoisted over to the entrance of the new discount mall. Lisa realizes that the &quot;end is near&quot; saga was a publicity stunt for the mall, exploiting people's deepest beliefs, and she calls for a <a href="boycott" class="uri" title="wikilink">boycott</a> of the mall. The bargain-loving public ignore Lisa, and go shopping. Dr. Gould confesses that he did not actually do any testing. <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> says that, for a few seconds while it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.</p>

<p>In an early draft of the script, the skeleton was made of baked pasty dough, baked by the mall's window dresser.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or <a href="paleontology" title="wikilink">paleontologist</a>, not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the &quot;world's most brilliant paleontologist.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His original final line was &quot;I didn't do the test. I had more important work to do&quot; but was cut because the writers felt it would be better to give him a short final line. Also, some thought it was too mean.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In their 2010 book <em>The Simpsons in the Classroom</em>, Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay note that the episode is one of the best for teachers and professors to use in religion or cultural studies courses, noting the irony that though Lisa is the only skeptic through most of the episode, she is the only one who is offended at the publicity stunt.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Parvin's <em>The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study</em> is a group study guide companion to Pinsky's <em>The Gospel According to the Simpsons.</em><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the section pertaining to &quot;Lisa the Skeptic,&quot; a skeptic is defined as: &quot;a person who doubts, questions, or suspends judgment on ideas generally accepted by others.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The study group is asked to debate the episode in the context of skepticism as related to other unexplained phenomena, including <a href="Unidentified_flying_object" title="wikilink">UFOs</a>, the <a href="Loch_Ness_Monster" title="wikilink">Loch Ness Monster</a>, the <a href="yeti" title="wikilink">Abominable Snowman</a>, the <a href="Bermuda_Triangle" title="wikilink">Bermuda Triangle</a>, <a href="Atlantis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atlantis</a>, <a href="near-death_experience" title="wikilink">near-death experiences</a>, <a href="reincarnation" class="uri" title="wikilink">reincarnation</a>, <a href="mediumship" class="uri" title="wikilink">mediumship</a>, <a href="psychic" title="wikilink">psychics</a>, and <a href="fortune-telling" class="uri" title="wikilink">fortune-telling</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In Pinsky's book itself, he noted that Lisa faced the difficult task of confronting <a href="zealotry" title="wikilink">religious hysteria</a> and <a href="faith" title="wikilink">blind faith</a>, and also attempted to reconcile science within her own belief system.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He also wrote that when Lisa asks Stephen Jay Gould to estimate the age of the skeleton, the issue is never raised of why angels or other spiritual entities would even leave skeletons behind in the first place.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>The scene in Judge Snyder's courtroom where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton is seen as a reference to the 1920s <a href="Scopes_Trial" title="wikilink">Scopes Monkey Trial</a> in <a href="Dayton,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Dayton, Tennessee</a>, which dealt with issues of <a href="separation_of_church_and_state" title="wikilink">separation of church and state</a> and the debate between <a href="creationism" class="uri" title="wikilink">creationism</a> and <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific <a href="hoax" title="wikilink">hoaxes</a> such as the <a href="Cardiff_Giant" title="wikilink">Cardiff Giant</a> and the <a href="Piltdown_Man" title="wikilink">Piltdown Man</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, <a href="Chief_Wiggum" title="wikilink">Chief Wiggum</a> is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a <a href="Pottery_Barn" title="wikilink">Pottery Barn</a> in the new Heavenly Hills mall.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A shot of the diggers in <a href="silhouette" class="uri" title="wikilink">silhouette</a> against the <a href="sunset" class="uri" title="wikilink">sunset</a> is modeled after <em><a href="Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="wikilink">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> (1981).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
