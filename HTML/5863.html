<p><strong>State Route 202</strong> (<strong>SR 202, OH 202</strong>) is a  north–south <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> in the western part of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>. The highway runs from its southern terminus at an interchange with the <a href="Ohio_State_Route_4" title="wikilink">SR 4</a> freeway in <a href="Dayton,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Dayton</a> to its northern terminus at a T-intersection with <a href="Ohio_State_Route_55" title="wikilink">SR 55</a> in the eastern end of <a href="Troy,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Troy</a>.</p>
<p>The debut of SR 202 took place in the middle of the 1920s. For much of its length, it parallels <a href="Interstate_75_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">Interstate 75</a> (I-75), which runs about  to the west. Along the way, SR 202 also travels near the eastern edge of the <a href="Great_Miami_River" title="wikilink">Great Miami River</a>.</p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>
<p>SR 202 traverses northeastern <a href="Montgomery_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Montgomery County</a> and southeastern <a href="Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Miami County</a> along its way. The highway begins in Dayton at an interchange between the SR 4 freeway and Troy Street, one block north of where Troy Street meets Valley Street on the northern banks of the <a href="Mad_River_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">Mad River</a>. SR 202 starts out as an urban roadway that heads north, then bends to the northeast, running parallel to the <a href="Great_Miami_River" title="wikilink">Great Miami River</a> for a couple of miles. Entering into a more suburban setting, SR 202 passes through the old village of Hooks Corner where it meets Needmore Road, then proceeds into the Dayton <a href="suburb" class="uri" title="wikilink">suburb</a> of <a href="Huber_Heights,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Huber Heights</a>. After curving to the north, SR 202 meets <a href="Interstate_70_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">I-70</a> at its Exit 36, a <a href="diamond_interchange" title="wikilink">diamond interchange</a>. A short distance later, SR 202 crosses into Miami County.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Now into <a href="Bethel_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Bethel Township</a>, the state highway travels northerly amidst a residential area prior to intersecting <a href="U.S._Route_40_(Ohio)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 40</a> (US 40) at a signalized intersection in the <a href="unincorporated_community" title="wikilink">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="Phoneton,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Phoneton</a>. SR 202 passes into a more rural setting composed primarily of farmland, with some clumps of trees and houses appearing along the way. It goes through the unincorporated community of <a href="West_Charleston,_Ohio" title="wikilink">West Charleston</a>, then goes on to meet <a href="Ohio_State_Route_571" title="wikilink">SR 571</a> at a signalized intersection east of <a href="Tipp_City,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Tipp City</a>. North of SR 571, SR 202 curves to the northwest, clipping the southwest corner of <a href="Elizabeth_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Township</a> prior to crossing into <a href="Staunton_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Staunton Township</a>. The route bends to the north immediately before it meets <a href="Ohio_State_Route_41" title="wikilink">SR 41</a> at a signalized intersection. SR 202 turns back to the northwest a short distance before it arrives at its endpoint at SR 55 at a T-intersection in the far eastern end of Troy, just north of the Miami Shores Golf Course.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>There is no portion of SR 202 that is included within the <a href="National_Highway_System_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Highway System</a> (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The SR 202 designation was applied in 1923. Originally, the highway followed the majority of its present routing, from its southern terminus in Dayton to its junction with SR 41, at the time designated as SR 70. It then followed the current SR 41's alignment northwest into downtown Troy, then crossed the Great Miami River concurrently with SR 55. SR 202 then split from SR 55, and was routed along Market Street heading northeast. The state highway then followed what is today known as County Road 193 (CR 193), heading east from Troy into <a href="Champaign_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Champaign County</a>. It came to an end at SR 55 southwest of <a href="Urbana,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Urbana</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1925, the entire east–west portion of SR 202 along the current CR 193 was removed from the state highway system. Consequently, the highway was shortened to its present alignment between Dayton and the current SR 41 junction.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The current northernmost portion of SR 202 between SR 41 and SR 55 was brought into the state highway system, and assigned the designation of SR 504.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It would be until 1982 before SR 504 would be replaced by a northward extension of SR 202, resulting in SR 202 taking on the routing that it utilizes today.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
