<p><strong>Devin Garret Townsend</strong> (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian <a href="musician" class="uri" title="wikilink">musician</a> and <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">record producer</a> best known as the co-founder, <a href="vocalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">vocalist</a> and <a href="guitarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitarist</a> in <a href="extreme_metal" title="wikilink">extreme metal</a> outfit <a href="Strapping_Young_Lad" title="wikilink">Strapping Young Lad</a>, and for his extensive work as a solo artist.</p>
<p>After performing in a number of <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">metal</a> bands in <a href="education_in_Canada" title="wikilink">high school</a>, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on <a href="Steve_Vai" title="wikilink">Steve Vai</a>'s album <em><a href="Sex_&amp;_Religion" title="wikilink">Sex &amp; Religion</a></em>. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on <a href="Heavy_as_a_Really_Heavy_Thing" title="wikilink">a solo album</a> released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed <em><a href="City_(Strapping_Young_Lad_album)" title="wikilink">City</a></em> in 1997. Since then, he has continued to write and record albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend's solo releases, a diverse mix of <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> and <a href="progressive_metal" title="wikilink">progressive metal</a>, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed The Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases.</p>
<p>Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked <a href="wall_of_sound" title="wikilink">wall of sound</a>, has been compared to the styles of <a href="Phil_Spector" title="wikilink">Phil Spector</a> and <a href="Frank_Zappa" title="wikilink">Frank Zappa</a>. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from <a href="screaming_(music)" title="wikilink">screaming</a> to <a href="clean_vocals" title="wikilink">singing</a>, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.</p>
<p>In 2007, Townsend disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band in order to spend more time with his family and less time touring. Townsend has since produced a number of albums for other groups, and continues to write and release self-produced albums from his home studio. Townsend is currently working on a four-album series called the Devin Townsend Project, with each album being written in a different style. The first entry in the series, <em><a href="Ki_(album)" title="wikilink">Ki</a></em>, was released in May 2009.</p>

<p><img src="Caustic_Thought_-_Kelowna,_BC,_1992.jpg" title="fig:Townsend (right) playing with Caustic Thought in Vancouver, British Columbia, 1992." alt="Townsend (right) playing with Caustic Thought in Vancouver, British Columbia, 1992." width="150" /> Devin Townsend was born in <a href="New_Westminster,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">New Westminster, British Columbia</a>, on May 5, 1972.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He participated in several <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">metal</a> bands while he was in <a href="education_in_Canada" title="wikilink">high school</a>, and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing <a href="Jed_Simon" title="wikilink">Jed Simon</a> on guitar and playing alongside <a href="bassist" class="uri" title="wikilink">bassist</a> <a href="Byron_Stroud" title="wikilink">Byron Stroud</a>, both of whom would later become members of Townsend's flagship band, <a href="Strapping_Young_Lad" title="wikilink">Strapping Young Lad</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as &quot;just as violent as Strapping Young Lad&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. <a href="Relativity_Records" title="wikilink">Relativity Records</a> responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, <em>Promise</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician <a href="Steve_Vai" title="wikilink">Steve Vai</a>. Impressed with Townsend's vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album <em><a href="Sex_&amp;_Religion" title="wikilink">Sex and Religion</a></em>. Townsend took the offer, unfamiliar with Vai's work and unaware of his acclaim in the music world. After recording <em>Sex and Religion</em>, Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Townsend's over-the-top personality and antics left him with a poor reputation after the <em>Sex and Religion</em> tour, and he ended up working in a Vancouver restaurant. This setback was brief, and Townsend soon landed a second touring gig, this time with the opening band of Vai's tour, <a href="The_Wildhearts" title="wikilink">The Wildhearts</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, and appeared as a guest musician on their single <a href="Urge_(Wildhearts)" title="wikilink">Urge</a>. <a href="Ginger_(singer)" title="wikilink">Ginger</a>, the band's frontman, remained close friends with Townsend,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> later co-writing several songs on <em><a href="Infinity_(Devin_Townsend_album)" title="wikilink">Infinity</a></em> and the <em>Christeen + 4 Demos</em> EP.</p>
<p>While on tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend formed a short-lived <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> project with with <a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a>'s then-<a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bassist</a> <a href="Jason_Newsted" title="wikilink">Jason Newsted</a>. The band, known as <a href="IR8_vs._Sexoturica" title="wikilink">IR8</a>, featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and <a href="Tom_Hunting" title="wikilink">Tom Hunting</a> of <a href="Exodus_(band)" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. &quot;People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true,&quot; he explains. &quot;People took this project way too seriously.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the <a href="IR8_vs._Sexoturica" title="wikilink">IR8 vs. Sexoturica</a> compilation.</p>
<p>Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. &quot;I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality,&quot; he later reflected. &quot;This combination was appalling.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> &quot;I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve,&quot; he mused.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> While touring with The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an <a href="A&amp;R" class="uri" title="wikilink">A&amp;R</a> representative for <a href="Roadrunner_Records" title="wikilink">Roadrunner Records</a>, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as &quot;just noise&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make &quot;some extreme albums&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and began to record material under the pseudonym <a href="Strapping_Young_Lad" title="wikilink">Strapping Young Lad</a>. Townsend avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. &quot;At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, <em><a href="Heavy_as_a_Really_Heavy_Thing" title="wikilink">Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing</a></em>, which was released in April 1995. Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded an album in 1996 entitled <em><a href="Cooked_on_Phonics" title="wikilink">Cooked on Phonics</a></em> for another one-off side project, <a href="Punky_Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ster" title="wikilink">Punky Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ster</a>. Written and recorded in under a month, the album was produced as a parody of <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success.</p>

<p>Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record <em><a href="City_(Strapping_Young_Lad_album)" title="wikilink">City</a></em>, including prolific metal drummer <a href="Gene_Hoglan" title="wikilink">Gene Hoglan</a>, along with Townsend's former bandmates <a href="Jed_Simon" title="wikilink">Jed Simon</a> on guitar and <a href="Byron_Stroud" title="wikilink">Byron Stroud</a> on bass. The <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a>-influenced<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> album was released in 1997. To this day, the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad's best work,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> with <em><a href="Metal_Maniacs" title="wikilink">Metal Maniacs</a></em> calling it &quot;groundbreaking&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and <em><a href="Revolver_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em> naming it &quot;one of the greatest metal albums of all time&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Townsend himself considers it the band's &quot;ultimate&quot; album.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Later that year, Townsend released his first solo album, <em><a href="Ocean_Machine:_Biomech" title="wikilink">Ocean Machine: Biomech</a></em>. The album featured a mix of <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a>, <a href="ambient_music" title="wikilink">ambient</a>, and <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="infinity-through-terria-1997u20132001"><em>Infinity</em> through <em>Terria</em> (1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2001)</h3>
<p>After the completion of <em>City</em> and <em>Biomech</em>, Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. &quot;I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat,&quot; he explained, &quot;life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand.&quot; In 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with <a href="bipolar_disorder" title="wikilink">bipolar disorder</a>. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder &quot;gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's <em>City</em> record and Ocean Machine's <em>Biomech</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that &quot;everything just clicked&quot; and he was able to write his second solo album, <em><a href="Infinity_(Devin_Townsend_album)" title="wikilink">Infinity</a></em>, which he described as &quot;the parent project&quot; of <em>City</em> and <em>Biomech</em>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> with music influenced by <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. <em>Infinity</em> was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited <em>Infinity</em> as his favorite solo record.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>With <em>Infinity</em>, Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name, dropping the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The album <em>Biomech</em> was relabeled and redistributed as <em>Ocean Machine: Biomech</em>, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as The Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Townsend's next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called <em>Fizzicist</em>, which they described as &quot;heavier than Strapping Young Lad&quot;. When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted's Metallica bandmates <a href="James_Hetfield" title="wikilink">James Hetfield</a> and <a href="Lars_Ulrich" title="wikilink">Lars Ulrich</a> learned of the project. Hetfield was &quot;fucking pissed&quot; that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, entitling it <em><a href="Physicist_(album)" title="wikilink">Physicist</a></em>. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it, the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash</a>-influenced<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <em>Physicist</em> was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsend's career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was <a href="Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)" title="wikilink">mixed</a>,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and Townsend considers it his worst album to date.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Feeling he had &quot;ostracized a bunch of fans&quot; with <em>Physicist</em>, Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an &quot;introspective&quot; album dedicated to his homeland.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He produced and recorded <em><a href="Terria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Terria</a></em>, a &quot;highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness&quot; album,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited <a href="Ween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ween</a>'s <em><a href="White_Pepper" title="wikilink">White Pepper</a></em> as an inspiration for the album.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Terria</em> was released in November 2001.</p>

<p>Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, <em><a href="Strapping_Young_Lad_(album)" title="wikilink">Strapping Young Lad</a></em>, as an emotional response to the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">attacks of September 11, 2001</a>, in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. &quot;If the world's about to blow up,&quot; said Townsend, &quot;let's write the soundtrack for it.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the &quot;hostile&quot; lyrics of <em>City</em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Musically, <em>Strapping Young Lad</em> was less <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a> than <em>City</em>,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and more reminiscent of death metal,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> with a &quot;larger-than-life&quot; <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> production style.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Townsend cited <a href="Front_Line_Assembly" title="wikilink">Front Line Assembly</a>, <a href="Grotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grotus</a>, and <a href="Samael_(band)" title="wikilink">Samael</a>'s <em><a href="Passage_(Samael_album)" title="wikilink">Passage</a></em> as influences.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The self-titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to <em>City</em>,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> but it was the band's first charting album, entering at 97th place on Billboard's <a href="Top_Heatseekers" title="wikilink">Top Heatseekers</a> chart.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>While Strapping Young Lad was being reunited, Townsend formed a new, permanent band &quot;on par with Strapping&quot; to record and tour for his solo releases.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian Waddell on <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, Mike Young on <a href="Bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass</a>, <a href="Ryan_Van_Poederooyen" title="wikilink">Ryan Van Poederooyen</a> on drums, and <a href="Dave_Young_(musician)" title="wikilink">Dave Young</a> on keyboards. Townsend performed guitar, vocals, and production, as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend worked on the band's first album, <em><a href="Accelerated_Evolution" title="wikilink">Accelerated Evolution</a></em>, at the same time he was working on <em>Strapping Young Lad</em>, spending half the week on one and half on the other.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <em>Accelerated Evolution</em>, named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> was released a month after <em>Strapping Young Lad</em>. Mike G. of <em><a href="Metal_Maniacs" title="wikilink">Metal Maniacs</a></em> called it &quot;the album of the year&quot;, praising it for &quot;the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy 'n' rockin' yet majestic and beautiful.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Prior to the formation of The Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup; the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> After the release of <em>Accelerated Evolution</em>, Townsend's two bands toured separately for their separate albums.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Strapping Young Lad began working on their next album, <em><a href="Alien_(album)" title="wikilink">Alien</a></em>, in March 2004.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Feeling that the band's previous album did not live up to expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> &quot;I think that as an artist, in order for me to get to the next plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy,&quot; he explains. &quot;And <em>Alien</em> was no exception with that.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Although Townsend considered the album an &quot;impenetrable mass of technicality&quot;,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and appearing on several <a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a> charts.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter Townsend began putting together the next Devin Townsend Band record, with the working title <em>Human</em>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Townsend intended the album as the more &quot;pleasant&quot; counterpart to <em>Alien</em>. &quot;It's basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with <em>Alien</em> for a while.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The album, <em><a href="Synchestra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Synchestra</a></em>, was released in January 2006. Townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in <em>Synchestra</em>, blending his trademark &quot;pop metal&quot; with influences from <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, <a href="polka" class="uri" title="wikilink">polka</a>, and <a href="Middle_Eastern_music" title="wikilink">Middle Eastern music</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ziltoid-and-hiatus-2006u20132008"><em>Ziltoid</em> and hiatus (2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2008)</h3>
<p>Townsend's wife, Tracy Turner, gave birth to their first son, Reyner Liam Johnstan Townsend, on October 4, 2006.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Around this time, Townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family. From home, Townsend completed his second solo ambient album, <em><a href="The_Hummer" title="wikilink">The Hummer</a></em>, releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.</p>
<p>In May 2007, Townsend released <em><a href="Ziltoid_the_Omniscient" title="wikilink">Ziltoid the Omniscient</a></em>, a tongue-in-cheek <a href="rock_opera" title="wikilink">rock opera</a> about the eponymous fictional <a href="extraterrestrial" title="wikilink">alien</a>. Townsend recorded the album alone in its entirety; he utilized <a href="Drumkit_from_Hell" title="wikilink">Drumkit from Hell</a>, a <a href="software" class="uri" title="wikilink">software</a> <a href="drum_machine" title="wikilink">drum machine</a> used by <a href="Meshuggah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meshuggah</a> on their album <em><a href="Catch_Thirtythree" title="wikilink">Catch Thirtythree</a></em>, for the drum tracks.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Shortly after the album's release, Townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or The Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was &quot;burnt out on travelling, touring, and self promotion&quot; and wished to do production work, write albums, and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, Townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the <a href="Adult_Swim" title="wikilink">Adult Swim</a> <a href="cartoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">cartoon</a> <em><a href="Metalocalypse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metalocalypse</a></em> (see <a href="Metalocalypse#Musician_cameos" title="wikilink">Musician cameos in <em>Metalocalypse</em></a> for more). The original character design for <a href="Dethklok#Pickles" title="wikilink">Pickles the Drummer</a>, one of the series' main characters, bore a striking resemblance to Townsend. The series' co-creator <a href="Brendan_Small" title="wikilink">Brendan Small</a> acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. &quot;We made sure he didn't look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>After removing himself from the music industry, Townsend cut his trademark hair off<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and gave up drinking and smoking.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Townsend found it &quot;disconcerting&quot; that he had difficulty writing music without drugs, and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician. He spent a year producing albums in absence of writing, but found it unrewarding and decided to &quot;pick up the guitar and just write&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> This began a period of &quot;self discovery&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> where he learned &quot;how to create without drugs&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Over two years, Townsend wrote over 60 songs, and found that they fit into &quot;four distinct styles&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a four-album series called the Devin Townsend Project,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being &quot;accountable&quot; for the persona he projects to the public.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The project's concept includes a different &quot;theme&quot; and a different group of musicians on each album.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
