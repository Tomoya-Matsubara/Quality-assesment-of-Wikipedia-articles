<p>The song runs 3 minutes and 27 seconds in length. It features Jaebeom as the lead rapper.</p>
<p>The song is about a very attractive woman, who is considered a &quot;10 out of 10&quot; in terms of her attractiveness. The song describes various aspects of her that are considered &quot;10 points&quot; - her lips, legs, hair, voice, and everything about her.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The music video was the band's last to feature leader <a href="Jay_Park" title="wikilink">Jaebeom</a> before he departed in controversy.</p>
<p>The music video starts with a woman pulling up and exiting a car.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She walks through a building, and the members of 2PM stare at her as she walks by. The remainder of the video intersperses scenes of the band dancing with videos about their interest in the woman.</p>
<p>The dancing scenes place in a reflective stage, with a crystal-like background.</p>
<p>Some scenes use humor to illustrate the band's fantasies or delusions about the woman. For example, at one point Wooyoung is initially eating whipped cream off the woman's finger; however, a later scene shows him with <a href="Kim_Junsu" title="wikilink">Junsu</a>'s finger in his mouth. Another scene shows <a href="Junho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Junho</a> playing with <a href="Taecyeon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taecyeon</a> at the pool, until he realizes Taecyeon is not the woman.</p>
<p>Near the end of the video, the woman walks away with a man, possibly her boyfriend. The members of 2PM look on with disappointment as the pair walk away.</p>
