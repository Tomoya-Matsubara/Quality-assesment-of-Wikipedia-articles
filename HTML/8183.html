His father was <a href="Robert_Wood_Johnson_III" title="wikilink">Robert Wood Johnson III</a>, president of Johnson &amp; Johnson for four years, and his mother was Betty Wold Johnson. Johnson grew up with four siblings: Keith Johnson, Billy Johnson, Elizabeth &quot;Libet&quot; Johnson, and Christopher Wold Johnson. He grew up in affluent areas of North <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, and attended the <a href="Millbrook_School" title="wikilink">Millbrook School</a>. He graduated from the <a href="University_of_Arizona" title="wikilink">University of Arizona</a>. Johnson then worked menial summer jobs at <a href="Johnson_&amp;_Johnson" title="wikilink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> with the expectation of ascending to the top of the family business.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Johnson became involved in charitable organizations full time in the 1980s. He is a member of the <a href="Council_on_Foreign_Relations" title="wikilink">Council on Foreign Relations</a>. His family has been affected by both lupus and juvenile diabetes, which motivated Johnson to take a role in raising funds to prevent, treat, and cure autoimmune diseases. He has led efforts on Capitol Hill and at the National Institutes of Health to increase research funding for lupus, diabetes, and other autoimmune diseases.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and personally contributed to causes related to diabetes, after his daughter <a href="Casey_Johnson" title="wikilink">Casey</a> was diagnosed with the disease. He also started a research foundation, the <a href="Alliance_for_Lupus_Research" title="wikilink">Alliance for Lupus Research</a>, after his daughter Jaime was found to have lupus.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2000, Johnson purchased the <a href="New_York_Jets" title="wikilink">Jets</a> for $635 million, the third-highest price for a professional sports team and the highest for one in New York. Johnson, who also owns courtside seats to the <a href="New_York_Knicks" title="wikilink">New York Knicks</a>, outbid the $612 million offered by <a href="Charles_Dolan" title="wikilink">Charles Dolan</a>, chairman of <a href="Cablevision" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cablevision</a>, which owns <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>, the <a href="Knicks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knicks</a> and the <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="wikilink">Rangers</a>. The team sold for more than $100 million above what some sports finance analysts had expected. Based on the Jets' recent financial performance and the team's low-revenue lease at Giants Stadium, the analysts said the team was really worth about $250 million.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After buying the Jets, Johnson announced plans to move them to the proposed <a href="West_Side_Stadium" title="wikilink">West Side Stadium</a> in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>. However, after the project's defeat in 2005, Johnson announced the Jets would move to a new <a href="New_Meadowlands_Stadium" title="wikilink">Meadowlands Stadium</a> (opening day 10 April 2010) co-owned with the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">Giants</a>. Johnson served on the NFL Commissioner search committee in which a list of 185 candidates to succeed <a href="Paul_Tagliabue" title="wikilink">Paul Tagliabue</a> was narrowed down to the final choice of <a href="Roger_Goodell" title="wikilink">Roger Goodell</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson is the chairman and chief executive of the <a href="Johnson_Company,_Inc." title="wikilink">Johnson Company, Inc.</a>, a private investment firm founded in 1978. In August 2006, Johnson was asked to testify before a Senate panel about his participation in a sham tax shelter. A Senate report said that Johnson, along with others, were able to buy, for relatively small fees, roughly $2 billion in capital losses that they used to erase taxable gains they garnered from stock sales. The U.S. Treasury lost an estimated $300 million in revenue as a result. In a statement, Johnson said he had been advised by his lawyers in 2000 that the transaction &quot;was consistent with the Tax Code.&quot; But after the Internal Revenue Service challenged that view in 2003, Johnson this year &quot;settled with the IRS and agreed to pay 100 percent of the tax due plus interest.&quot; <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson was the committee president for Pre-Commissioning Unit for the <a href="USS_New_York_(LPD-21)" title="wikilink">USS New York (LPD-21)</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
