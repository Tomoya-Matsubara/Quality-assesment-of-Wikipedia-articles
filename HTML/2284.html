<p>Ventura was born James George Janos in <a href="Minneapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a>, the son of Bernice Martha (<a href="married_and_maiden_names" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> Lenz) and George William Janos. His father's parents were from what is today <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a>, and his mother was of German descent.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Ventura has described himself as <a href="Slovak_American" title="wikilink">Slovak</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Ventura (then still using his legal name of Janos) attended the now-closed Cooper Elementary School, and graduated from Minneapolis' <a href="Roosevelt_High_School_(Minneapolis)" title="wikilink">Roosevelt High School</a> in 1969.</p>
<p>From September 11, 1969 to September 10, 1975, during the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> era, he served in the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> While on active duty, Ventura was part of <a href="Underwater_Demolition_Team" title="wikilink">Underwater Demolition Team 12</a> (UDT).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The UDT was merged with the <a href="United_States_Navy_SEALs" title="wikilink">US Navy SEALs</a> in 1983, 8 years after Ventura was no longer in the Navy. He was awarded the <a href="National_Defense_Service_Medal" title="wikilink">National Defense Service Medal</a> and the <a href="Vietnam_Service_Medal" title="wikilink">Vietnam Service Medal</a> but was not in combat thus did not qualify for the <a href="Combat_Action_Ribbon" title="wikilink">Combat Action Ribbon</a>.</p>
<p>In 1973, Ventura was a full-patch member of the <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> chapter of the <a href="Mongols_(motorcycle_club)" title="wikilink">Mongols</a>, an <a href="Outlaw_motorcycle_club#One_Percenters" title="wikilink">outlaw</a> motorcycle gang and <a href="organized_crime_syndicate" title="wikilink">organized crime syndicate</a> for nine months, and rose to the rank of Sergeant-at-Arms. His <a href="nickname" class="uri" title="wikilink">nickname</a> by Mongol members was &quot;<a href="Superman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Superman</a>&quot;. Ventura has said on <em><a href="The_Howard_Stern_Show" title="wikilink">The Howard Stern Show</a></em> in 2009 that &quot;once you're a Mongol, you're always a Mongol.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

He was a bodyguard for <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a> for a short time before he ventured into professional wrestling and changed his name.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="professional-wrestling-career">Professional wrestling career</h2>

<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<p>He created the stage name Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name &quot;<a href="Ventura,_California" title="wikilink">Ventura</a>&quot; from a map as part of his &quot;bleach <a href="blond" class="uri" title="wikilink">blond</a> from <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>&quot; <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#G" title="wikilink">character</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a <a href="heel_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">villain</a> and often used the motto &quot;Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!&quot; Much of his flamboyant persona was copied from <a href="Billy_Graham_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">&quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham</a>, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s and '80s.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.</p>
<h3 id="singles-and-tag-team-success">Singles and tag team success</h3>
<p>In 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter <a href="Don_Owen_(wrestling_promoter)" title="wikilink">Don Owen</a> as Jesse &quot;The Great&quot; Ventura.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Sometime later, he adopted the more permanent nickname, &quot;The Body&quot;. During his stay in <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland, Oregon</a>, he had notable feuds with <a href="Dutch_Savage" title="wikilink">Dutch Savage</a> and <a href="Jimmy_Snuka" title="wikilink">Jimmy Snuka</a> and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler), and the tag team title five times (twice each with <a href="Apache_Bull_Ramos" title="wikilink">Bull Ramos</a> and <a href="Buddy_Rose" title="wikilink">&quot;Playboy&quot; Buddy Rose</a>, and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the <a href="American_Wrestling_Association" title="wikilink">American Wrestling Association</a> in Minnesota, and began teaming with <a href="Adrian_Adonis" title="wikilink">Adrian Adonis</a> as the &quot;East-West Connection&quot; in 1979.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The duo won the promotion's <a href="AWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship" title="wikilink">World Tag Team Championship</a> on July 20, 1980 on a forfeit when <a href="Verne_Gagne" title="wikilink">Verne Gagne</a>, one-half of the tag team champions along with <a href="Maurice_Vachon" title="wikilink">Mad Dog Vachon</a>, failed to show up for a title defense in <a href="Denver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to &quot;The High Flyers&quot; (<a href="Greg_Gagne_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Greg Gagne</a> and <a href="Jim_Brunzell" title="wikilink">Jim Brunzell</a>).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="retirement-and-commentary">Retirement and commentary</h3>
<p>Shortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">World Wrestling Federation</a>, where they were managed by <a href="Freddie_Blassie" title="wikilink">&quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although the duo was unable to capture the <a href="World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)" title="wikilink">World Tag Team Championship</a>, both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at <a href="WWE_Championship" title="wikilink">World Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Bob_Backlund" title="wikilink">Bob Backlund</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Ventura continued to wrestle until September 1984, when blood clots in his lungs ended his in-ring career; it forced him to miss a title match against WWF Champion <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Ventura claimed the blood clots were a result of his exposure to <a href="Agent_Orange" title="wikilink">Agent Orange</a> during his time in Vietnam.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Ventura did return to the ring to participate in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 as he, <a href="Roddy_Piper" title="wikilink">Roddy Piper</a>, and &quot;Cowboy&quot; <a href="Bob_Orton" title="wikilink">Bob Orton</a> defeated <a href="Hillbilly_Jim" title="wikilink">Hillbilly Jim</a>, <a href="Stan_Frazier" title="wikilink">Uncle Elmer</a>, and <a href="Gene_Petit" title="wikilink">Cousin Luke</a> in a match which was broadcast on <em>Saturday Night's Main Event</em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> After a failed comeback bid, he began to do <a href="color_commentator#wrestling" title="wikilink">color commentary</a> on television for <em><a href="List_of_former_World_Wrestling_Entertainment_programming#All-Star_Wrestling_(1970&lt;U+2013&gt;1986)" title="wikilink">All-Star Wrestling</a></em> (replacing <a href="Angelo_Mosca" title="wikilink">Angelo Mosca</a>) and later <em><a href="WWF_Superstars_of_Wrestling" title="wikilink">Superstars of Wrestling</a></em> (initially alongside <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a> and <a href="Bruno_Sammartino" title="wikilink">Bruno Sammartino</a>, and with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in 1988), hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's <em>Superstars of Wrestling</em> called &quot;The Body Shop&quot;, and did color commentary on radio for a few <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> teams (among them, the <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a> and <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Ventura most notably co-hosted <em><a href="Saturday_Night&#39;s_Main_Event" title="wikilink">Saturday Night's Main Event</a></em> with Vince McMahon and the first six <a href="WrestleMania" title="wikilink">WrestleManias</a> (1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1990) and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with <a href="Gorilla_Monsoon" title="wikilink">Gorilla Monsoon</a> (the lone exception for Ventura being the <a href="SummerSlam_(1988)" title="wikilink">first SummerSlam</a>, in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event). Following a dispute with WWF Chairman Vince McMahon over him using his image for the video game company <a href="Sega" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sega</a>, McMahon&lt;U+2014&gt;who had a contract with rival company <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a> at the time&lt;U+2014&gt;released Ventura from the company in August 1990.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1992 at <a href="World_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">WCW</a> <a href="SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl_II" title="wikilink">SuperBrawl II</a>, Ventura joined <a href="World_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">World Championship Wrestling</a> as a commentator. His professional wrestling commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> but would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of <a href="Dynamite_Kid" title="wikilink">Dynamite Kid</a> and <a href="Randy_Savage" title="wikilink">Randy Savage</a> (who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a <a href="Face_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">fan favorite</a>). The lone exception to this rule was the <a href="WrestleMania_VI" title="wikilink">WrestleMania VI</a> match between Hulk Hogan and the <a href="Warrior_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Ultimate Warrior</a>. Since they were both crowd favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary; even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship to the Warrior after he lost the title. The praise of Hogan's action was unusual for Ventura because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches. Hogan and Ventura were, at one point, close friends.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Ventura, however, abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against Vince McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told Vince about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Ventura was released by WCW President <a href="Eric_Bishoff" title="wikilink">Eric Bishoff</a> for falling asleep during a <em>WCW Worldwide</em> TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, though its been speculated the move may have had more to do with Hulk Hogan's arrival shortly before.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="litigation">Litigation</h3>
<p>In 1987, while negotiating his contract as a <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">WWF</a> commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received <a href="royalties" class="uri" title="wikilink">royalties</a>, Ventura brought an action for <a href="fraud" class="uri" title="wikilink">fraud</a>, misappropriation of <a href="publicity" class="uri" title="wikilink">publicity</a> rights, and <a href="quantum_meruit" title="wikilink">quantum meruit</a> in <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> <a href="state_court" title="wikilink">state court</a> against Titan Sports. Titan removed the case to <a href="United_States_district_court" title="wikilink">federal court</a>, and Ventura won an $801,333 <a href="jury" class="uri" title="wikilink">jury</a> <a href="verdict" class="uri" title="wikilink">verdict</a> on the last claim. The judgment was affirmed on <a href="appeal" class="uri" title="wikilink">appeal</a>, and the case,''<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> '' 65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of <a href="restitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">restitution</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of Ventura's <a href="lawsuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawsuit</a>, whenever WWE uses his commentary for mass marketed <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a>/<a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>, Ventura gets a percentage of the sales.</p>

<p>In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as Governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for main event of <a href="SummerSlam_(1999)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a> held in Minneapolis.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Ventura would continue his relationship with the WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived <a href="XFL" class="uri" title="wikilink">XFL</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> On the March 20, 2003 episode of <em><a href="WWE_SmackDown" title="wikilink">SmackDown!</a></em>, Ventura appeared in a <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#V" title="wikilink">taped interview</a> to talk about the match between McMahon and <a href="Hulk_Hogan" title="wikilink">Hulk Hogan</a> at <a href="WrestleMania_XIX" title="wikilink">WrestleMania XIX</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Less than a year later, he would be inducted into the <a href="WWE_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">WWE Hall of Fame</a> on March 13, 2004 and the following night at <a href="WrestleMania_XX" title="wikilink">WrestleMania XX</a>, he approached the ring to interview <a href="Donald_Trump" title="wikilink">Donald Trump</a>, who had a front row seat at the event.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter the world of politics. Alluding to the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 election</a>, Ventura boldly announced that &quot;In 2008, maybe we oughta put a wrestler in the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a>&quot;. On the June 11, 2007 episode of <em><a href="WWE_Raw" title="wikilink">Raw</a></em>, Ventura appeared to give comments about Vince McMahon.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of <em>Raw</em> during which he retained his <a href="heel_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">villainous</a> persona by siding with the number one contender, <a href="Sheamus_O&#39;Shaunessy" title="wikilink">Sheamus</a> over WWE Champion <a href="John_Cena" title="wikilink">John Cena</a>. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE while Ventura didn't during his WWE career. After that Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Title match at <a href="WWE_TLC:_Tables,_Ladders_&amp;_Chairs" title="wikilink">TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs</a>. During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, Vince McMahon joined Ventura at ringside to provide match commentary together.</p>

<p>Ventura acted in the 1987 movie <em><a href="Predator_(film)" title="wikilink">Predator</a></em>, whose cast included future <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> <a href="List_of_Governors_of_California" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="wikilink">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and future <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> <a href="Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Gubernatorial</a> candidate <a href="Sonny_Landham" title="wikilink">Sonny Landham</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He appeared in two episodes of <em><a href="Zorro_(1990_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Zorro</a></em> filmed in Madrid, Spain in 1991.

<h3 id="mayor-of-brooklyn-park">Mayor of Brooklyn Park</h3>
<p>Following his departure from the WWF, Ventura took advice from a former high school teacher and ran for <a href="mayor" class="uri" title="wikilink">mayor</a> of <a href="Brooklyn_Park,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Park, Minnesota</a> in 1990.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Ventura defeated the city's 18-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="governor-of-minnesota">Governor of Minnesota</h3>

<p>Ventura ran for Governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party of Minnesota (he later joined the <a href="Independence_Party_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Independence Party of Minnesota</a> when the Reform Party broke from its association with the <a href="Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Reform Party of the United States of America</a>). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive <a href="grassroots" class="uri" title="wikilink">grassroots</a> events and original television spots, designed by quirky adman <a href="Bill_Hillsman" title="wikilink">Bill Hillsman</a>, using the phrase &quot;Don't vote for politics as usual.&quot; He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>He won the election in November 1998, narrowly (and unexpectedly) defeating the major-party candidates, <a href="Saint_Paul,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">St. Paul</a> mayor <a href="Norm_Coleman" title="wikilink">Norm Coleman</a> (<a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a>) and Minnesota <a href="State_Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> <a href="Skip_Humphrey" title="wikilink">Hubert H. &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey III</a> (<a href="Minnesota_Democratic-Farmer-Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic-Farmer-Labor</a>). After his victory, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan &quot;My governor can beat up your governor&quot; appeared in Minnesota. The nickname &quot;Jesse 'The Mind'&quot; (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's <em>Thinker</em>) began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his frequently controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name &quot;Jesse 'The Body'&quot; (sometimes adapted to &quot;Jesse 'The Governing Body'&quot;) also continued to appear with some regularity.</p>
<p>After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in <a href="Maple_Grove,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Maple Grove</a>. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that &quot;the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.&quot; The petition was denied. <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>During his tenure as Governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as &quot;media jackals,&quot; a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and <a href="List_of_humorists" title="wikilink">humorist</a> <a href="Garrison_Keillor" title="wikilink">Garrison Keillor</a> wrote a <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirical</a> book about the event, spoofing Ventura as &quot;Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,&quot; a self-aggrandizing former &quot;Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)&quot; turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor &quot;makes Minnesota proud&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> During his term, Ventura appeared on <em><a href="Late_Show_with_David_Letterman" title="wikilink">The Late Show with</a> <a href="David_Letterman" title="wikilink">David Letterman</a></em>, in which he responded controversially to the following question: &quot;So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?&quot;. Ventura responded, &quot;Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen&quot;. He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>After a <a href="trade" class="uri" title="wikilink">trade</a> mission to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> in 2002, he announced that he would not run for a second term.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues.

<div id="Prostitution"/>
<p>Governor Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, <a href="Mae_Schunk" title="wikilink">Mae Schunk</a>, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="political-positions">Political positions</h4>

<p>Ventura's main campaign promise was a <a href="tax_refund" title="wikilink">tax refund</a>. The state was running a <a href="budget" class="uri" title="wikilink">budget</a> surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the money should be given back to the public. In <a href="Leaders_debate" title="wikilink">political debates</a>, he often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain <a href="policy" class="uri" title="wikilink">policy</a> questions. Ventura frequently described himself as &quot;fiscally <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">conservative</a> and socially <a href="liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a>.&quot; He selected teacher <a href="Mae_Schunk" title="wikilink">Mae Schunk</a> as his running mate. His participation in the 1998 Minnesota Governor debates boosted his popularity as a candidate.</p>
<p>Later as governor, he came to support a <a href="unicameralism" title="wikilink">unicameral</a> (one-house) <a href="legislature" class="uri" title="wikilink">legislature</a>, <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> public transport, <a href="property_tax" title="wikilink">property tax</a> reform, <a href="LGBT_social_movements" title="wikilink">gay rights</a>, and <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a> rights. In an interview on <em>The Howard Stern Show</em>, he affirmed his support of gay rights, including gay marriage and gays in the military, stating he would've gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would've provided less competition for women.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> While funding <a href="Public_school_(government_funded)" title="wikilink">public school</a> education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for the public funding of <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> institutions. Additionally, Ventura supported the use of <a href="medicine" title="wikilink">medicinal</a> <a href="cannabis_(drug)" title="wikilink">marijuana</a>, advocated a higher role for <a href="third_party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">third parties</a> in national politics, and favored the concept of <a href="instant-runoff_voting" title="wikilink">instant-runoff voting</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking a <a href="political_party" title="wikilink">party</a> base in the <a href="Minnesota_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Minnesota House</a> and <a href="Minnesota_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a>, Governor Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Governor Ventura's <a href="veto" title="wikilink">vetoes</a> would be overturned. Ventura vetoed 45 bills in his first year, and only 3 of those vetoes were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, where 6 of his 9 vetoes were overturned.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Ventura was elected on a Reform party ticket, but he never received support from <a href="Ross_Perot" title="wikilink">Ross Perot</a>'s Texas faction. When the Reform party was taken over by <a href="Pat_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Pat Buchanan</a> supporters before the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2000" title="wikilink">presidential elections of 2000</a>, Ventura left the party in February 2000, referring to it as 'hopelessly dysfunctional'. However, he maintained close ties to the <a href="Independence_Party_of_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Independence Party of Minnesota</a>, which also broke from the Reform party around the same time.</p>
<p>During the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">mass transit</a> improvements, such as <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a>. In his March 1999 State address, he proclaimed, &quot;I want to ride a train by 2002,&quot; referring to a <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> line running between downtown <a href="Minneapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a> and the <a href="Mall_of_America" title="wikilink">Mall of America</a>. He made the light rail project a priority, obtaining additional funding from the Minnesota state legislature to keep the project moving. The <a href="Hiawatha_Line" title="wikilink">Hiawatha Line</a> was completed in 2004.</p>
<p>Ventura vetoed a bill to require <a href="recitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">recitation</a> of the <a href="Pledge_of_Allegiance" title="wikilink">Pledge of Allegiance</a> in <a href="Public_school_(government_funded)" title="wikilink">public schools</a>, saying:</p>

<h4 id="wellstone-memorial">Wellstone memorial</h4>
<p>Ventura greatly disapproved of some of the actions that took place at the 2002 memorial for <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senator</a> <a href="Paul_Wellstone" title="wikilink">Paul Wellstone</a>, his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002.

Ventura had initially planned to appoint a Democrat to Wellstone's seat,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> but he instead appointed <a href="Dean_Barkley" title="wikilink">Dean Barkley</a> to represent <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a> in the Senate until Wellstone's term expired in January 2003.</p>

<h5 id="religion">Religion</h5>
<p>In a <em><a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a></em> interview, he said, &quot;Organized <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a> is <a href="Criticism_of_religion" title="wikilink">a sham</a> and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business.&quot; In his 1999 best-selling <a href="memoir" class="uri" title="wikilink">memoir</a> <em>I Ain't Got Time to Bleed</em>, Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion: &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;d like to clarify [my comments published in <em>Playboy</em>] about religious people being weak-minded. I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t mean all religious people. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That&lt;U+2019&gt;s why the <a href="Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">founding fathers</a> built <a href="Freedom_of_religion" title="wikilink">freedom of religious belief</a> into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the <a href="fundamentalism" title="wikilink">fundamentalist</a> <a href="Fanaticism" title="wikilink">fanatics</a> are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That&lt;U+2019&gt;s what I find weak and destructive.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Ventura endorsed <a href="social_equality" title="wikilink">equal rights</a> for <a href="minority_religion" title="wikilink">religious minorities</a>, as well as people who <a href="Nontheism" title="wikilink">don't believe in God</a>, by declaring July 4, 2002, &quot;Indivisible Day&quot; through this proclamation:</p>

<h5 id="prostitution">Prostitution</h5>
<p>Ventura has publicly stated that <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> should be legal, since it will exist in any case, and legal controls protecting the health of clients and workers are needed.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He said &quot;I voted in hopes to make prostitution legal once, and I'd do it again in a second.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-media">Other media</h2>
<p>Between 1995 and his run for governor in 1998, Ventura had <a href="Talk_radio" title="wikilink">radio call-in shows</a> on (<a href="KFAN_(AM)" title="wikilink">KFAN</a> 1130) and (<a href="KSTP_(AM)" title="wikilink">KSTP</a> 1500) in <a href="Minneapolis_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Saint_Paul" title="wikilink">Minneapolis &lt;U+2013&gt; Saint Paul</a>. Jesse had a brief role on the television soap opera <em><a href="The_Young_and_the_Restless" title="wikilink">The Young and the Restless</a></em> in 1999.</p>
<p>Ventura has been criticized for privately profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed <a href="XFL" class="uri" title="wikilink">XFL</a> <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a> enterprise, <a href="SummerSlam_(1999)" title="wikilink">served as a referee at a World Wrestling Federation match</a>, and published several books during his tenure as governor.

<h2 id="post-gubernatorial-life">Post-gubernatorial life</h2>

<p>Ventura was succeeded in his office by Republican <a href="Tim_Pawlenty" title="wikilink">Tim Pawlenty</a>. He began a cable television show in October 2003, on <a href="MSNBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">MSNBC</a> called <em>Jesse Ventura's America</em>. The show was broadcast once a week, on Saturdays, unlike many MSNBC shows which are on five nights a week (this show was originally planned for five nights a week as well, but MSNBC executives changed their minds). At the time of its airing, <em>Jesse Ventura's America</em> was the only national <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> show filmed in <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a>. Among his guests were <a href="Charles_Barkley" title="wikilink">Charles Barkley</a>, <a href="Gray_Davis" title="wikilink">Gray Davis</a>, <a href="Arianna_Huffington" title="wikilink">Arianna Huffington</a>, <a href="Rob_Kampia" title="wikilink">Rob Kampia</a>, and Kathy McKee.</p>
<p>In 2004, fellow Navy veteran and <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard</a> graduate student Christopher Mora promoted the idea that the academic establishment had failed to reach out to citizens experienced in public service, but who did not fit the traditional idea of a politician. He successfully lobbied for the selection of Ventura, who started teaching a study group at Harvard University for the Spring 2004 semester as a visiting <a href="fellow" class="uri" title="wikilink">fellow</a> at the <a href="John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government" title="wikilink">Kennedy School of Government</a>'s Institute of Politics (IOP). His 90-minute study group focused on third party politics, campaign finance, the war on drugs, and other relevant political issues. Ventura scheduled multiple famous friends to appear for his seminars including <a href="Dean_Barkley" title="wikilink">Dean Barkley</a> and <a href="Richard_Marcinko" title="wikilink">Richard Marcinko</a>.</p>
<p>On October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> Governor <a href="Angus_King" title="wikilink">Angus King</a> endorsed <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a> for President at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference. When prodded for a statement, Governor King responded, &quot;He plans to vote for <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a>, but he doesn't want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 2004, an advertisement began airing in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> featuring Ventura.

On the program, which debuted on December 2, 2009, Ventura travels the country, investigating cases and getting input from believers and skeptics before passing judgment on a theory's validity.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> According to TruTV, the first episode drew 1.6 million viewers, a record for a new series on the network.</p>
