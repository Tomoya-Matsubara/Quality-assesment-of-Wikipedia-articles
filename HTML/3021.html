The game is included as a <a href="pack-in_game" title="wikilink">pack-in game</a> with the Wii console in all territories except Japan,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> making it the first game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since <em><a href="Mario&#39;s_Tennis" title="wikilink">Mario's Tennis</a></em> for the <a href="Virtual_Boy" title="wikilink">Virtual Boy</a> in <a href="1995_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1995</a>. <em>Wii Sports</em> is part of an ongoing series of games referred to as the <em><a href="Wii_Series" title="wikilink">Wii Series</a></em>, and a <a href="Touch!_Generations" title="wikilink">Touch! Generations</a> game.</p>
<p>The game is a collection of five <a href="sport" title="wikilink">sports</a> simulations, designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the <a href="Wii_Remote" title="wikilink">Wii Remote</a> to new players. The five sports included are <a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a>, <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, <a href="ten-pin_bowling" title="wikilink">bowling</a>, <a href="golf" class="uri" title="wikilink">golf</a>, and <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a>. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a <a href="racquet" title="wikilink">tennis racket</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor player progress in the sports.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Overall, <em>Wii Sports</em> has been well received by critics and received awards from the gaming press and entertainment community. It was the <a href="2007_in_video_gaming#Japan" title="wikilink">best-selling game of 2007</a> in Japan, and by the end of March 2008, the game had sold 21.56 million copies worldwide (including bundled copies).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>Wii Sports</em> has been featured on <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> in Wii commercials, news reports, and other programming.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The game has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="WS-WiiRemote_Example.jpg" title="fig:The player uses the Wii Remote to mimic the motion of putting a golf ball in a game of golf" alt="The player uses the Wii Remote to mimic the motion of putting a golf ball in a game of golf" /> <em>Wii Sports</em> consists of five separate sports games&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a>, <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, <a href="Ten-pin_bowling" title="wikilink">bowling</a>, <a href="golf" class="uri" title="wikilink">golf</a>, and <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;accessed from the main menu.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and <a href="Wii_Remote#Nunchuk" title="wikilink">Nunchuk</a> attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a <a href="Golf_club_(equipment)" title="wikilink">golf club</a>, <a href="baseball_bat" title="wikilink">baseball bat</a> or <a href="bowling_ball" title="wikilink">bowling ball</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball consists of <a href="Batting_(baseball)" title="wikilink">batting</a> and <a href="Pitcher" title="wikilink">pitching</a>, with all of the fielding handled by the Wii.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Each game features a standard play mode, training mode, and multiple player options.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The standard play mode mimics each game's respective method of play: tennis, a <a href="Types_of_tennis_match" title="wikilink">doubles match</a>; baseball, a simple game of pitching and batting; bowling, a ten-pin, ten-frame game; golf, playing on a 3-hole or 9-hole <a href="golf_course" title="wikilink">golf course</a>; and boxing, a three round boxing match.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Training mode is a single player option that allows a player to practice certain aspects of the sports and rewards them with <a href="Medal#Competition_medals" title="wikilink">medals</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Every game has a single player or two-player mode, and some games allow up to four players via various methods.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Bowling and golf allow for multiple players taking turns with a single Wii Remote,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> while tennis requires each player to have their own. The multiplayer mode for <em>Wii Sports</em> usually has the players competing against each other in the normal manner of the specific sports; the one exception is tennis which allows for two players to play together or against each other.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The in-game characters are taken from the Wii's <a href="Wii_Menu#Mii_Channel" title="wikilink">Mii Channel</a>, which allows the user to create a <a href="Mii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mii</a> (a customized <a href="Avatar_(computing)" title="wikilink">avatar</a>) that can be imported into games that support the feature. <em>Wii Sports</em> is the first Wii title to use this feature.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Miis saved on the Wii will appear in the crowd during bowling games and as team members in baseball. The <a href="non-player_character" title="wikilink">non-player characters</a> in the game were also created using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="player-progress">Player progress</h3>
<p>After a game, a player is awarded or penalized skill points based on performance, though some games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps track of these points by charting them on a graph. After obtaining 1000 skill points in a sport, a player is awarded &quot;pro level&quot;, along with a cosmetic feature for their Mii. A Mii newly turned pro will receive a message on the <a href="Wii_Menu#Message_Board" title="wikilink">Wii Message Board</a> notifying them. In single-player boxing and tennis, the size of the crowd grows with the player's skill level. <em>Wii Sports</em> also features a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness age. The test gauges the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges from the training mode. Calculating the fitness age takes into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. The test itself can only be taken once a day per Mii. Fitness age results are graphed over one, two, or three months, with daily results posted on the Wii Message Board.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended <em>Wii Sports</em> to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <em>Wii Sports</em> was designed as a simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Sports were chosen as the theme because of the wide-spread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> At one point in development, <a href="Mario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mario</a> characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players who preferred Miis.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The game supports a <a href="Aspect_ratio_(image)#16:9_standard" title="wikilink">16:9 widescreen ratio</a> and <a href="progressive_scan" title="wikilink">progressive scan</a>, runs at 60 <a href="Frame_rate" title="wikilink">frames per second</a>,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and makes use of the Wii Remote's <a href="accelerometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">accelerometer</a> to interpret the player's motion.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Wii Sports</em> was bundled with the Wii because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the system solely to play the game. Nintendo thought by including it with the Wii, players would be more likely to play it, and if they enjoyed the game, that enjoyment would spread.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the <a href="E3" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) Media and Business Summit of 2006, the first sport in the game was announced as <em>Wii Sports: Tennis</em>. It was later announced, at Nintendo's press conference prior to E3 2006, it would be part of a sports package.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="Satoru_Iwata" title="wikilink">Satoru Iwata</a> introduced this package as <em>Wii Sports</em>, and stated it would include tennis, golf, and baseball. The game was featured as both a video demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. The demo featured Iwata and <a href="Reggie_Fils-Aime" title="wikilink">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> in a doubles tennis match against <a href="Shigeru_Miyamoto" title="wikilink">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and Scott Dyer, a contest winner.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The other sports titles were on display at E3 and shared a similar naming convention to the tennis game such as, <em>Wii Sports: Baseball</em>, <em>Wii Sports: Golf</em>, and <em>Wii Sports: Airplane</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> At the time, baseball only featured a batting simulation.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The airplane title was similar to <em><a href="Pilotwings" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pilotwings</a></em> and required the player to maneuver an airplane through rings within a time frame.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> It was not included in the final game, but is believed to be part of a future game for the Wii titled <em>Wii Motor Sports</em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> At the Nintendo World event on September 14, 2006, Reggie Fils-Aime announced that <em>Wii Sports</em> would be included free with the Wii.
