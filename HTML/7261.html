<p>The <strong>Peru national football team</strong> has represented <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a> in international <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> since 1927. Organised by the <a href="Peruvian_Football_Federation" title="wikilink">Peruvian Football Federation</a> (FPF), it is one of the 10 members of <a href="FIFA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FIFA</a>'s South American Football Confederation (<a href="CONMEBOL" class="uri" title="wikilink">CONMEBOL</a>). The Peruvian team's performance has been inconsistent; it enjoyed its most successful periods in the 1930s and the 1970s. Managed by <a href="Pablo_Bengoechea" title="wikilink">Pablo Bengoechea</a>, it plays most of its home matches at the <a href="Estadio_Nacional_(Lima)" title="wikilink">Estadio Nacional</a> in <a href="Lima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lima</a>, the country's capital.</p>
<p>The Peru national team has won the <a href="Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a> <a href="Peru_at_the_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">twice</a> and qualified for <a href="FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">FIFA World Cup finals</a> <a href="Peru_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">four times</a>; it also <a href="Peru_at_the_Olympics" title="wikilink">participated</a> in the <a href="Football_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1936 Olympic football competition</a>. It has longstanding rivalries <a href="Chile&lt;U+2013&gt;Peru_football_rivalry" title="wikilink">with Chile</a> and Ecuador.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The team is well known for its white shirts adorned with a red &quot;<a href="sash" class="uri" title="wikilink">sash</a>&quot; running from the left shoulder to the right hip&lt;U+2014&gt;this basic design has been used continuously since 1936.

<p>Peru took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and enjoyed victories in the <a href="1938_Bolivarian_Games" title="wikilink">1938 Bolivarian Games</a> and the <a href="1939_South_American_Championship" title="wikilink">1939 Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a>, with goalkeeper <a href="Juan_Valdivieso" title="wikilink">Juan Valdivieso</a> and forwards <a href="Teodoro_Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez" title="wikilink">Teodoro Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez</a> and <a href="Alejandro_Villanueva" title="wikilink">Alejandro Villanueva</a> playing important roles. Peruvian football's successful period in the 1970s brought it worldwide recognition; the team then included the formidable forward partnership of <a href="Hugo_Sotil" title="wikilink">Hugo Sotil</a> and <a href="Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo_Cubillas" title="wikilink">Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Cubillas</a>, often regarded as Peru's greatest player, and defender <a href="H&lt;U+00E9&gt;ctor_Chumpitaz" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00E9&gt;ctor Chumpitaz</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This team qualified for three World Cups and won the <a href="1975_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica in 1975</a>.</p>
<p>The Peruvian team last reached the World Cup finals <a href="1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">in 1982</a>; it has since failed to qualify, and has not won any major tournament. FIFA temporarily suspended the country from international competition in late 2008 during the Peruvian government's investigations into alleged corruption within the FPF. Peru came third at the <a href="2011_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">2011 Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a>, but failed to qualify for the <a href="2014_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2014 World Cup</a> in Brazil.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">Association football</a> was introduced to Peru in the 19th century by <a href="British_Peruvian" title="wikilink">British immigrants</a> and Peruvians returning from England.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Members of the British community in the capital <a href="Lima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lima</a> founded the <a href="Lima_Cricket_and_Football_Club" title="wikilink">Lima Cricket Club</a>, dedicated to cricket, rugby and football, in 1859.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These new sports became popular among upper-class Peruvians over the following decades. After early developments were halted by the <a href="War_of_the_Pacific" title="wikilink">War of the Pacific</a> against Chile from 1879 to 1883,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> coastal society in Peru embraced modern innovations such as football. The sport became a popular daily activity in Lima <a href="barrio" title="wikilink">barrios</a>, encouraged by bosses who hoped that it would breed solidarity and improved productivity among their workers. In the adjacent port of <a href="Callao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Callao</a> and other commercial areas, British civilian workers and sailors played the sport among themselves and with locals. Sports rivalries between locals and foreigners arose in Callao, and between elites and workers in Lima. Over time, as foreigners departed, this evolved into a rivalry between Callao and Lima.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><ref>See:</p>

<li><p>,</p></li>
<li><p>.</ref> These factors, coupled with the sport's rapid development among the urban poor of Lima's <a href="La_Victoria_District,_Lima" title="wikilink">La Victoria</a> district (where the Alianza Lima club was formed in 1901), led to Peru developing the strongest footballing culture in the <a href="Andes" title="wikilink">Andean region</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="Peruvian_Primera_Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Peruvian Football League</a> was formed in 1912 and held each year until it broke up in 1921 amid disputes between the member clubs. The <a href="Peruvian_Football_Federation" title="wikilink">Peruvian Football Federation</a> (FPF) was created the following year and, in 1926, it reorganised the annual league competition.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The FPF joined the South American Football Confederation (<a href="CONMEBOL" class="uri" title="wikilink">CONMEBOL</a>) in 1925, and formed a national team in 1927&lt;U+2014&gt;the delay was due to financial issues.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The team debuted in the <a href="1927_South_American_Championship" title="wikilink">1927 South American Championship</a>, which the FPF hosted at the <a href="Estadio_Nacional_(Lima)" title="wikilink">Estadio Nacional</a> in Lima. Peru's first match was a 0&lt;U+2013&gt;4 loss against <a href="Uruguay_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a>; their second was a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory over <a href="Bolivia_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Bolivia</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Peru next took part in the <a href="1930_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">inaugural FIFA World Cup</a> in Uruguay in 1930. The 1930s have been called Peruvian football's first <a href="Golden_generation" title="wikilink">golden era</a>. Starting with <a href="Ciclista_Lima_Association" title="wikilink">Ciclista Lima</a> in 1926, Peruvian clubs toured <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a>. During one of these tours&lt;U+2014&gt;Alianza Lima's undefeated journey through Chile in 1935&lt;U+2014&gt;a group of players emerged that became called the <em><a href="Rodillo_Negro" title="wikilink">Rodillo Negro</a></em> (&quot;Black Roller&quot;), led by forwards <a href="Alejandro_Villanueva" title="wikilink">Alejandro Villanueva</a> and <a href="Teodoro_Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez" title="wikilink">Teodoro Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez</a> and goalkeeper <a href="Juan_Valdivieso" title="wikilink">Juan Valdivieso</a>.<ref>See:</p>

He attributes this sudden decline to Peruvian authorities' repression of &quot;social, sporting and political organisations among the urban and rural poor&quot; during the 1940s and 1950s. Peru generally performed creditably at the South American Championships during this period, nevertheless, and only narrowly missed qualification for the <a href="1958_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Sweden 1958 World Cup</a> finals, losing over <a href="Two-legged_tie" title="wikilink">two legs</a> to eventual champions Brazil.</p>
<p>A series of successes during the late 1960s, culminating with qualification for the <a href="1970_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1970 World Cup</a> finals in Mexico, ushered in a second golden period for Peruvian football.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The formidable forward partnership between <a href="Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo_Cubillas" title="wikilink">Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Cubillas</a> and <a href="Hugo_Sotil" title="wikilink">Hugo Sotil</a> has been cited as a key factor in Peru's success during the 1970s. Peru reached the quarter-finals in 1970, losing to the tournament winners Brazil, and earned the first <a href="FIFA_Fair_Play_Trophy" title="wikilink">FIFA Fair Play Trophy</a>;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> the team was, Richard Henshaw writes, &quot;the surprise of the 1970 competition, showing flair and a high level of skill&quot;. Five years later, Peru were crowned South American champions for the second time when they <a href="1975_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">won</a> the 1975 <a href="Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a> (as the South American Championship was renamed that year). The team then qualified for two consecutive World Cup tournaments: it reached the second round in <a href="1978_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Argentina 1978</a>, and was knocked out in the first group stage at the <a href="1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1982 tournament</a> in Spain. Peru's early elimination in 1982 ended a period when the side's &quot;flowing football was admired across the globe&quot;.</p>
<p>Following the team's <a href="1986_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(CONMEBOL)" title="wikilink">failure to qualify</a> for the <a href="1986_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1986 World Cup</a> in Mexico, renewed expectations for Peru were centred on a young generation of Alianza Lima players known colloquially as <em>Los Potrillos</em> (&quot;The Colts&quot;). The team entered a hiatus after the <a href="1987_Alianza_Lima_air_disaster" title="wikilink">Alianza Lima air disaster</a> of 8 December 1987, when a plane carrying most of Alianza's players and staff crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Only the pilot survived the crash; among the dead were the Peru manager, <a href="Marcos_Calder&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Marcos Calder&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a>, and several Peru international players, including goalkeeper <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez_Ganoza" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez Ganoza</a> and <a href="Luis_Antonio_Escobar_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Luis Escobar</a>, who was widely tipped as a future star forward. The team came last in both the 1990 and 1994 World Cup qualifiers, but had recovered slightly by the turn of the century. After earning fourth place at the <a href="1997_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">1997 Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a>, Peru <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(CONMEBOL)" title="wikilink">missed qualification</a> for the <a href="1998_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">France 1998 World Cup</a> only on <a href="goal_difference" title="wikilink">goal difference</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Peru later won the 1999 <a href="Kirin_Cup" title="wikilink">Kirin Cup</a> in Japan (sharing the title with Belgium) and <a href="Peru_at_the_CONCACAF_Gold_Cup" title="wikilink">placed third</a> at the <a href="2000_CONCACAF_Gold_Cup" title="wikilink">2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> which it contested as an invited guest team.

The distinctive diagonal red &quot;<a href="sash" class="uri" title="wikilink">sash</a>&quot;, emblazoned across Peru's white shirts continuously since 1936, has won praise as a simple yet effective design.</a> The Peru national football team plays in red and white, the country's national colours. Its first-choice <a href="Kit_(association_football)" title="wikilink">kit</a> has been, since 1936, white shorts, white socks, and white shirts with a distinctive red &quot;<a href="sash" class="uri" title="wikilink">sash</a>&quot; crossing their front diagonally from the <a href="Proper_right" title="wikilink">proper left</a> shoulder to the right hip and returning on the back from the right hip to the proper left shoulder. This basic scheme has been only slightly altered over the years.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> It has won praise as one of world football's most attractive kit designs; Christopher Turpin, the executive producer of <a href="NPR" class="uri" title="wikilink">NPR</a>'s <em><a href="All_Things_Considered" title="wikilink">All Things Considered</a></em> news show, lauded the 1970 iteration in 2010 as &quot;the beautiful game's most beautiful shirt&quot;, also commenting that it &quot;was retro even in 1970&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The version worn in 1978 came first in a 2010 <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a> list of the &quot;Best World Cup jerseys of all time&quot;, described therein as a &quot;simple yet strikingly effective piece of design&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The traditional home of Peruvian football is the country's national stadium, the Estadio Nacional in Lima, which houses 45,000 spectators.

The stadium was last redeveloped in 2011; improvements included the construction of a plaque-covered exterior, a multicoloured illumination system added inside the ground, as well as two giant <a href="Light-emitting_diode" title="wikilink">LED</a> screens and 375 private suites.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Football has been the most popular sport in Peru since the early 20th century. The sport was originally largely exclusive to Lima's <a href="Anglophile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglophile</a> elite and expatriates, and secluded from the rest of the city, but it became an integral part of wider popular culture during the 1900s and 1910s. Augusto B. Legu&lt;U+00ED&gt;a's government institutionalised the sport into a national pastime over the following decades by promoting and organising its development.</p>
<p>Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive chant <em>&lt;U+00A1&gt;Arriba Per&lt;U+00FA&gt;!</em> (&quot;Come on Peru!&quot;), as well as for their use of traditional Peruvian <em><a href="m&lt;U+00FA&gt;sica_criolla" title="wikilink">m&lt;U+00FA&gt;sica criolla</a></em> to express support, both at national team games and at club matches. <em>M&lt;U+00FA&gt;sica criolla</em> attained national and international recognition with the advent of <a href="mass_media" title="wikilink">mass media</a> during the 1930s, becoming a widely recognised symbol of Peru and its culture. The national team's most popular anthem is <em><a href="Peru_Campe&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Peru Campe&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a></em>, a <em><a href="polca_criolla" title="wikilink">polca criolla</a></em> (Peruvian polka) glorifying Peru's qualification for the Mexico 1970 World Cup.</p>
<p>The <a href="Estadio_Nacional_disaster" title="wikilink">Estadio Nacional disaster</a> of 24 May 1964, involving Peruvian supporters, is often cited as one of the worst tragedies in football history.<ref>See:</p>

Spectators threw missiles from the stands while two fans invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. Police threw <a href="tear_gas" title="wikilink">tear gas</a> into the crowd, which caused a stampede; trying to escape, fans were crushed against the stadium's locked gates. A total of 315 people were killed in the chaos, with more than 500 others injured.<ref>See:</p></li>

<p>The Peru football team maintains prominent rivalries with its counterparts from neighbouring <a href="Chile_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Chile</a> and <a href="Ecuador_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Ecuador</a>. The Peruvians have a favourable record against Ecuador and a negative record against Chile.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Both of these rivalries date back to the 1939 South American Championship in Lima, when Peru first faced Ecuador and Chile in an official tournament; Peru won both games. Peru's first FIFA World Cup matches against its two rivals were played during qualifying for the Argentina 1978 World Cup. Peru defeated Ecuador over two legs, then beat Chile in the same manner, directly eliminating them both.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The Chile&lt;U+2013&gt;Peru football rivalry is known in Spanish as the <em>Cl&lt;U+00E1&gt;sico del Pac&lt;U+00ED&gt;fico</em> (&quot;Pacific Derby&quot;).<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> World Sport editor Greg Duke ranks it among the top ten football rivalries in the world.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The two countries traditionally compete with each other over the rank of fourth-best national team in South America (after Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay). They also both claim to have invented the <a href="bicycle_kick" title="wikilink">bicycle kick</a>; Peruvians call it the <em>chalaca</em>, while it is the <em>chilena</em> in Chile.</p>
<p>The rivalry between the Ecuador and Peru football teams is rooted in the historical <a href="History_of_the_Ecuadorian&lt;U+2013&gt;Peruvian_territorial_dispute" title="wikilink">border conflict</a> between the countries dating back to the 19th century. In 1995, after the brief <a href="Cenepa_War" title="wikilink">Cenepa War</a>, CONMEBOL contemplated altering <a href="1995_Copa_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">that year's Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica</a> group stage to prevent a match between the two sides, but ultimately did not. According to Michael Handelsman, Ecuadorian fans consider losses to Colombia or Peru &quot;an excuse to lament Ecuador's inability to establish itself as an international soccer power&quot;. During the Brazil 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Ecuador's captain <a href="Walter_Ayov&lt;U+00ED&gt;" title="wikilink">Walter Ayov&lt;U+00ED&gt;</a> declared that &quot;these matches have always had something additional, a thorough rivalry.

<p>Peru's national team has taken part in 31 editions of the Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica since 1927, and has won the competition twice (in 1939 and 1975). The country has hosted the tournament six times (in 1927, 1935, 1939, 1953, 1957 and 2004).

<p>Peru won its first continental title in 1939, when it won the South American Championship with successive victories over Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. It was the first time the competition had been won by a team other than Uruguay, Brazil or Argentina. Peru became South American champions for the second time in 1975, when it won that year's Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica, the first to feature all ten CONMEBOL members. Peru came top of their group in the first round, eliminating Chile and Bolivia, and in the semifinals drew with Brazil over two legs, winning 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 in Brazil but losing 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at home. Peru were declared winners by drawing of lots. In the two-legged final between Colombia and Peru, both teams won their respective home games (1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in Bogota and 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in Lima), forcing a play-off in <a href="Caracas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracas</a> which Peru won 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0.</p>

<p>Teodoro Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez, Alejandro Villanueva, and Juan Valdivieso are often regarded as the key members of the <em>Rodillo Negro</em> team of the 1930s.
