Siebenb&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen was then densely populated by <a href="Germans_of_Romania" title="wikilink">ethnic Germans</a> commonly referred to as <a href="Transylvanian_Saxons" title="wikilink">Transylvanian Saxons</a>. His father was a surgeon, his mother was the daughter of a peasant, and both families had lived in Siebenb&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen for centuries. After finishing school in Hermannstadt, Phleps entered the <a href="Imperial_and_Royal" title="wikilink">Imperial and Royal</a> cadet school in <a href="Bratislava" title="wikilink">Pressburg</a> (in modern-day <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a>) in 1900 and on 1 November 1901 was commissioned as a <em><a href="leutnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">leutnant</a></em> (lieutenant) in the 3rd Regiment of the <em><a href="County_of_Tyrol" title="wikilink">Tiroler</a> <a href="Gebirgsj&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger" title="wikilink">Kaiserj&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger</a></em> (mountain infantry).</p>
<p>In 1903 he was transferred to the 11th <em>Feldj&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger</em> (rifle) Battalion in <a href="K&lt;U+0151&gt;szeg" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00FC&gt;ns</a> (in modern-day <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>), and in 1905 was accepted into the <a href="Theresian_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">Theresian Military Academy</a> in <a href="Wiener_Neustadt" title="wikilink">Wiener Neustadt</a>. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the <a href="Staff_(military)" title="wikilink">General Staff</a>. Following promotion to <em><a href="oberleutnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">oberleutnant</a></em> (first lieutenant) he was successively transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at <a href="Osijek" title="wikilink">Esseg</a> in <a href="Slavonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavonia</a> and then the 6th Infantry Division in <a href="Graz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Graz</a>. This was followed by a promotion to <em><a href="hauptmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">hauptmann</a></em> (captain) in 1911 along with a position on the staff of the XV <a href="Corps" title="wikilink">Army Corps</a> in <a href="Sarajevo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarajevo</a> where he specialised in <a href="mobilisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">mobilisation</a> and <a href="military_communications" title="wikilink">communications</a> in the difficult terrain of <a href="Bosnia_(region)" title="wikilink">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herzegovina</a>.</p>
<h2 id="world-war-i">World War I</h2>
<p>At the outbreak of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> Phleps was serving with the staff of the 32nd Infantry Division in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>. The division was involved in the early stages of the <a href="Serbian_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Serbian campaign</a>, during which Phleps was transferred to the <a href="Operations_(military_staff)" title="wikilink">operations staff</a> of the Second <a href="Field_army" title="wikilink">Army</a>. The Second Army was soon withdrawn from the Serbian front and deployed via the <a href="Carpathian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Carpathian Mountains</a> to the Austro-Hungarian province of <a href="Kingdom_of_Galicia_and_Lodomeria" title="wikilink">Galacia</a> (modern-day <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>) to defend against a successful offensive by the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>. The Second Army continued to fight the Russians in and around the Carpathians through the winter of 1914&lt;U+2013&gt;1915. In 1915 Phleps was again transferred, this time to <em>Armeegruppe Rohr</em> commanded by <em><a href="General_of_the_Cavalry_(Germany)" title="wikilink">General der Kavallerie</a></em> (General) <a href="Franz_Rohr_von_Denta" title="wikilink">Franz Rohr von Denta</a>, which was formed in the <a href="Carinthia_(state)" title="wikilink">Austrian Alps</a> in response to the <a href="Kingdom_of_Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> declaration of war in May 1915. <em>Armeegruppe Rohr</em> became the basis for the formation of the <a href="10th_Army_(German_Empire)" title="wikilink">10th Army</a>, which was headquartered in <a href="Villach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Villach</a>. Phleps subsequently became the deputy <a href="quartermaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartermaster</a> of the 10th Army, responsible for organising the supply of the troops fighting the Italians in the mountains.</p>
<p>On 1 August 1916, Phleps was promoted to <em><a href="major" class="uri" title="wikilink">major</a></em>. In late August 1916, King <a href="Ferdinand_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Ferdinand of Romania</a> led the <a href="Kingdom_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Romania</a> in joining the <a href="Triple_Entente" title="wikilink">Triple Entente</a>, and subsequently invaded Phleps' homeland of Siebenb&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen. On 27 August Phleps became the chief of staff of the 72nd Infantry Division, which was involved in Austro-Hungarian operations to repel the Romanian invasion. He remained in this theatre of operations for the next two years, ultimately serving as the chief quartermaster of the German <a href="9th_Army_(German_Empire)" title="wikilink">9th Army</a>, and was awarded the <a href="Iron_Cross" title="wikilink">Iron Cross</a> 2nd class on 27 January 1917. In 1918 he returned to the mountains when he was transferred to <em>Armeegruppe Tirol</em>, and ended the war as an <em><a href="oberstleutnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">oberstleutnant</a></em> (lieutenant colonel) as the chief quartermaster for the entire <a href="Italian_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Alpine Front</a>.</p>
<h2 id="between-the-wars">Between the wars</h2>
<p>After the war, and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Phleps returned to his homeland, which had become part of Romania under the <a href="Treaty_of_Trianon" title="wikilink">Treaty of Trianon</a>. He joined the <a href="Romanian_Land_Forces" title="wikilink">Romanian Army</a> and was appointed as commander of the Saxon National Guard, a <a href="militia" class="uri" title="wikilink">militia</a> formed from the German-speaking people of Siebenb&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_Kun" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Kun</a>, which <a href="Hungarian&lt;U+2013&gt;Romanian_war_of_1919" title="wikilink">fought Romania in 1919</a>. He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment as an <em><a href="oberst" class="uri" title="wikilink">oberst</a></em> (colonel) and then joined the general staff and taught <a href="Military_logistics" title="wikilink">logistics</a> at the War Academy in <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>. He attended the V Army Corps <a href="staff_college" title="wikilink">staff college</a> in <a href="Bra&lt;U+0219&gt;ov" title="wikilink">Kronstadt</a>, and published a book in 1926 which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. He commanded various Romanian units before being appointed to command the 1st Brigade of the <a href="V&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;tori_de_munte" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;tori de munte</a> (mountain troops) and acting as an advisor to King <a href="Carol_II_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Carol II</a> in the 1930's.</p>

<h3 id="ss-motorised-division-wiking">SS Motorised Division <em>Wiking</em></h3>
<p>In 1941, Phleps asked for permission to leave Romania to join the <a href="Wehrmacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wehrmacht</a>. This was granted, but he volunteered for the <a href="Waffen-SS" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waffen-SS</a> instead. He was appointed as a <em>SS-<a href="Standartenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Standartenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer</a></em> by <em><a href="Reichsf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer-SS" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reichsf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer-SS</a></em> <a href="Heinrich_Himmler" title="wikilink">Heinrich Himmler</a> and joined the <a href="5th_SS_Panzer_Division_Wiking" title="wikilink">SS Motorised Division <em>Wiking</em></a>. When <a href="Hilmar_W&lt;U+00E4&gt;ckerle" title="wikilink">Hilmar W&lt;U+00E4&gt;ckerle</a>, the commander of SS-Regiment <em>Westland</em> was killed in action near <a href="Lvov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lvov</a> in late June 1941, Phleps took over command of that regiment. Phleps distinguished himself in the fighting at <a href="Kremenchuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kremenchuk</a> and <a href="Dnipropetrovsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dnipropetrovsk</a> in the <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, and became a <a href="confidant" class="uri" title="wikilink">confidant</a> of <em><a href="Generaloberst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Generaloberst</a></em> <a href="Hans-Valentin_Hube" title="wikilink">Hans-Valentin Hube</a>, commander of the <a href="16th_Infantry_Division_(Wehrmacht)" title="wikilink">16th Panzer Division</a>, and was subsequently promoted to <em><a href="oberf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer" class="uri" title="wikilink">oberf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer</a></em> (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was awarded the clasp to the Iron Cross 2nd class and then the Iron Cross 1st class.</p>
<h3 id="th-ss-volunteer-mountain-division-prinz-eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen</h3>
<p>On 30 December 1941, <em><a href="Generalfeldmarschall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Generalfeldmarschall</a></em> (Field Marshal) <a href="Wilhelm_Keitel" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Keitel</a> advised Himmler that <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> had authorised the raising of a seventh Waffen-SS division from the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia. Two weeks later, <em>SS-<a href="Brigadef&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer" title="wikilink">Brigadef&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS</a></em> (Brigadier) Phleps was selected to organise the new division. On 1 March 1942, the division was officially designated the <em>SS-Freiwilligen-Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;</em>. Phleps was promoted to <em>SS-<a href="Gruppenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer" title="wikilink">Gruppenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer und Generalleutnant der Waffen SS</a></em> (major general) on 20 April 1942. After recruiting, formation and training in the <a href="Banat_(1941-1944)" title="wikilink">Banat</a> in October 1942 the two regiments and supporting arms were deployed into the southwestern part of the <a href="Territory_of_the_Military_Commander_in_Serbia" title="wikilink">Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia</a> as an anti-<a href="Yugoslav_Partisan" title="wikilink">Partisan</a> force. Headquartered in <a href="Kraljevo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraljevo</a>, and with the two regiments centred on <a href="U&lt;U+017E&gt;ice" class="uri" title="wikilink">U&lt;U+017E&gt;ice</a> and <a href="Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka,_Serbia" title="wikilink">Ra&lt;U+0161&gt;ka</a>, the division continued to train. Some artillery batteries, the anti-aircraft battalion and the motorcycle battalion and cavalry squadron continued to form in the Banat.</p>
<p>In early October 1942, the division commenced Operation <em>Kopaonik</em>, targeting the <a href="Chetnik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chetnik</a> force of Major <a href="Dragutin_Keserovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Dragutin Keserovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> in the <a href="Kopaonik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kopaonik</a> Mountains, which ended with little success. After a quiet winter, in January 1943 Phleps deployed the division to the <a href="Independent_State_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Independent State of Croatia</a> (NDH) to participate in <a href="Case_White" title="wikilink">Case White</a>. Between 13 February and 9 March 1943 he was responsible for the initial aspects of raising the <a href="13th_Waffen_Mountain_Division_of_the_SS_Handschar_(1st_Croatian)" title="wikilink">13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)</a> in the NDH in addition to his duties commanding the 7th SS. During Case White, the 7th SS captured <a href="Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> and <a href="Bosanski_Petrovac" title="wikilink">Bosanski Petrovac</a>, killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400. After a short rest and refit during April, the division was committed to <a href="Case_Black" title="wikilink">Case Black</a> during May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the <a href="Mostar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mostar</a> area into <a href="Kingdom_of_Montenegro_(1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1944)" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a>, killing 250 Partisans and capturing over 500. While under Phleps' command, the division committed many crimes against the civilian population of the NDH, especially during Case White and Case Black. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to <em>SS-Brigadef&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS</em> <a href="Karl_von_Oberkamp" title="wikilink">Karl von Oberkamp</a>.</p>
<p>In July 1943 Phleps was promoted to <em>SS-<a href="Obergruppenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Obergruppenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer</a> und General der Waffen-SS</em> (lieutenant general), was awarded the <a href="Knight&#39;s_Cross_of_the_Iron_Cross" title="wikilink">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a>, and placed in command of the <a href="V_SS_Mountain_Corps" title="wikilink">V SS Mountain Corps</a>.</p>
<h3 id="v-ss-mountain-corps">V SS Mountain Corps</h3>
<p>The formations under the command of V SS Mountain Corps varied during Phlep's command. In July 1944 it consisted of the <a href="118th_J&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger_Division_(Wehrmacht)" title="wikilink">118th J&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger Division</a> and <a href="369th_(Croatian)_Infantry_Division_(Wehrmacht)" title="wikilink">369th (Croatian) Infantry Division</a> in addition to the 7th SS and 13th SS divisions. Throughout Phlep's command, the corps was under the overall command of <a href="2nd_Panzer_Army" title="wikilink">2nd Panzer Army</a> and conducted anti-Partisan operations throughout the NDH and Montenegro. These operations included Operations <em><a href="Operation_Kugelblitz" title="wikilink">Kugelblitz</a></em> (ball lightning) and <em>Schneesturm</em> (blizzard), which were part of a major offensive in eastern Bosnia in December 1943, but it was only a limited success.</p>
<p>Due to the unreliable nature of the troops loyal to the NDH government, Phleps utilised Chetnik forces as auxiliaries, stating to a visiting officer that he could not disarm the Chetniks unless the NDH government provided him with the same strength in reliable troops. In January 1944, due to fears that the <a href="Western_Allies" title="wikilink">Western Allies</a> would invade along the <a href="Dalmatia" title="wikilink">Dalmatian</a> coastline and islands, V SS Mountain Corps forced the mass evacuation of male civilians between the ages of 17 and 50 from that area. Phleps was criticised by both NDH and German authorities for the harshness with which the evacuation was carried out. Phleps was awarded the <a href="German_Cross" title="wikilink">German Cross</a> in Gold on 20 June 1944.</p>
<p>In September 1944, Phleps was appointed as the commander of German occupation troops in Siebenb&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen and the <a href="Banat_(1941&lt;U+2013&gt;1944)" title="wikilink">Banat</a> and he was killed near <a href="Arad,_Romania" title="wikilink">Arad, Romania</a> on 21 September 1944 after being captured by an advanced unit of the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a>. He was posthumously awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 24 November 1944.</p>
