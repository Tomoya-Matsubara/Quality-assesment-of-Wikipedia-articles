<p>The <strong>Ottawa RedBlacks</strong> (stylized by the Ottawa ownership group in <a href="all-caps" class="uri" title="wikilink">all-caps</a> as <strong>REDBLACKS</strong>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ()<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> are a professional football team based in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a>, Ontario, Canada, who play in the <a href="CFL_East_Division" title="wikilink">East Division</a> of the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a>. The team planned to begin play in 2010, until cracks in the concrete structure in the south stands of Frank Clair Stadium led to the demolition of those stands; the league later set a date of 2013 for the team's debut, but lawsuits forced the delay of construction on the stadium to be pushed back even further.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This will be the third CFL team to play in the city. The <a href="Ottawa_Rough_Riders" title="wikilink">Ottawa Rough Riders</a>, formed in 1876, was a founding member of the CFL in 1958 and played until 1996. A new Ottawa franchise was formed as the &quot;Renegades&quot; in 2002, and lasted until the end of the 2005 season.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <a href="Ottawa_Renegades" title="wikilink">Ottawa Renegades</a> abruptly ceased operations prior to the <a href="2006_CFL_season" title="wikilink">2006 CFL season</a>. The league liquidated the Renegades roster in a dispersal draft and placed the Ottawa CFL franchise up for sale with the intent of eventually returning to the city.</p>
<p>On March 25, 2008, an ownership group led by <a href="Ottawa_67&#39;s" title="wikilink">Ottawa 67's</a> owner <a href="Jeff_Hunt" title="wikilink">Jeff Hunt</a> was awarded the franchise. The team will play at a remodelled <a href="Frank_Clair_Stadium" title="wikilink">Frank Clair Stadium</a> now called TD Place Stadium, and will begin play in 2014 if construction remains on schedule.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> While in 2008 the franchise was conditionally awarded the right to host the <a href="102nd_Grey_Cup" title="wikilink">2014 Grey Cup</a> game,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Jeff Hunt has indicated that he would like to postpone the game for a few years to give his franchise a better chance to play in the championship game<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and after lawsuits and delays, the stadium renovations will not be completed until 2014.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Hosting the Grey Cup is a condition included in the agreement giving Hunt control of the franchise.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>7 million franchise fee was reported to have been paid to the CFL.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The team had been in contact with previous Rough Riders owner <a href="Horn_Chen" title="wikilink">Horn Chen</a> regarding the <em>Rough Riders</em> name and the team &quot;[knows] his price.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Rough Riders name still retains popular currency among football fans in Ottawa. The Rough Riders played for 120 years, during which time they won the <a href="Grey_Cup" title="wikilink">Grey Cup</a> nine times.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, in July 2010, Jeff Hunt announced that the Rough Riders name would likely not be returning due to the objections of the <a href="Saskatchewan_Roughriders" title="wikilink">Saskatchewan Roughriders</a>, though the team did successfully purchase the rights to the Rough Riders name from Chen.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Concurrently, <a href="Ottawa_Senators" title="wikilink">Ottawa Senators</a> owner <a href="Eugene_Melnyk" title="wikilink">Eugene Melnyk</a> had announced plans to bid for a <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a> franchise to play in Ottawa and to build a <a href="Ottawa_Soccer_Stadium" title="wikilink">new soccer specific stadium</a> near the Senators' <a href="Scotiabank_Place" title="wikilink">Scotiabank Place</a> in support of these plans. Depending on the stadium's design it could be used by a CFL team instead of the aging Frank Clair Stadium. However, the CFL and MLS groups have not indicated that they are co-ordinating their plans. Furthermore, municipal officials have questioned whether the city could support both a CFL and an MLS franchise.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 2009, the staff of the City of Ottawa presented a report to Council on the merits of the Soccer Stadium and Lansdowne proposals. The city held public hearings based on the report, which questioned the necessity of the spending, but gave a slight edge to the Lansdowne proposal. Councillors attempted to find out whether the SSE group would support sharing their stadium with a planned CFL franchise, but the SSE group rejected the possibility. On April 22, 2009, the City of Ottawa Council chose the Lansdowne Live proposal over the SSE proposal as its choice for an outdoor stadium. Over the next several months, negotiations were made leading up to August 26, where a presentation was made to Ottawa City Council would decide the fate of football in Ottawa in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>On November 12 and 13, City Council held a public debate to discuss what should be done with the area at Lansdowne Park. Guest speakers included <a href="Mark_Cohon" title="wikilink">Mark Cohon</a> and former <a href="Ottawa_Rough_Riders" title="wikilink">Rough Riders</a> <a href="Jock_Climie" title="wikilink">Jock Climie</a> and <a href="Mark_Kosmos" title="wikilink">Mark Kosmos</a> who presented their case as to why Lansdowne Live was an important contributor to the city of Ottawa.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The following Monday, on November 16, it was reported that Ottawa City Council had voted 15&lt;U+2013&gt;9 in favour of plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park to house a CFL team.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The Hunt Group had until June 2010 to sort out the details of the redevelopment with construction likely to begin in the spring of 2011.</p>
<p>On June 28, 2010, after a 12-hour meeting, Ottawa City Council approved the plan to redevelop <a href="Lansdowne_Park" title="wikilink">Lansdowne Park</a> by the same vote of 15&lt;U+2013&gt;9, all but securing a franchise in the nation's capital.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With construction on the stadium originally scheduled to begin in 2011, the earliest a team could play would be in <a href="2013_CFL_season" title="wikilink">2013</a> under the original time line.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After a failed legal challenge and an Ontario Municipal Board hearing on the <a href="Lansdowne_Park_redevelopment" title="wikilink">Lansdowne Park redevelopment</a>, construction on the stadium will not begin until 2012, with a completion in summer 2015, although there have been indications that the stadium could be opened for CFL football as early as 2014.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Without a viable stadium, the debut of the team would necessarily be pushed back accordingly.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 10, 2012, the new franchise clear its final political hurdle when a 21&lt;U+2013&gt;3 vote by the Ottawa City Council in favour of the redevelopment of Lansdowne Park passed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Construction on the north and south side stands was set to begin in October 2012.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>On December 6, 2012, the CFL opened voting for the name of the team, up until December 16, 2012, on www.nameourteams.com. It was speculated that the team would be called the Rush, but this was later debunked.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The Rush name was nonetheless included in a list of five potential names (Nationals, Voyageurs, RedBlacks, and Raftsmen being the others) for the team in a focus group led by the team's owners in January 2013.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The RedBlacks mascot is a lumberjack whose original name, &quot;Big Joe Mufferaw&quot;, was revealed by the team on March 28, 2014.
