<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>A <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> <a href="Standards_and_practices" title="wikilink">censor</a> named Fox Censor, deleting things from the episode's script, announces that thanks to his editing tonight's <em>Simpsons</em> episode is rated <a href="TV-G" class="uri" title="wikilink">TV-G</a>, stating that the episode will not have &quot;raunchy <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>-style sex&quot; or &quot;<a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>-style violence.&quot; As he says this, a hand with a sword appears out of the on-screen rating icon and stabs him in the back repeatedly, raising the rating with every stab. He collapses dead onto the desk, leaving a final rating of &quot;TV-<a href="Number_of_the_Beast" title="wikilink">666</a>&quot;. Three self-contained segments then follow.</p>
<h3 id="the-hu03a9mega-man">The H&lt;U+03A9&gt;mega Man</h3>
<p><a href="Joe_Quimby" title="wikilink">Mayor Quimby</a> generates controversy after making an offensive joke about France. After refusing to apologize, the French president launches a <a href="neutron_bomb" title="wikilink">neutron bomb</a> directly into Springfield. <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons#Herman" title="wikilink">Herman</a>'s military surplus store. After the blast Homer emerges from the shelter and seems to be the only person in town to have survived. Sorrowful at first, he quickly cheers up once he realises he can now do whatever he pleases. However, Homer is soon confronted by a band of Springfield citizens who have become <a href="mutant" title="wikilink">mutants</a>. They claim they want to create a perfect world in which the mistakes of the past will be eliminated - including Homer. Homer flees and arrives at his home where he finds that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of <a href="lead_paint" title="wikilink">lead paint</a>. Seeing Homer reunited with his family, the mutants see the error of their ways. They hope they can build a <a href="Utopia" title="wikilink">Utopian society</a> with the Simpsons, but <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> and the children kill them with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs. The family then head off to steal some Ferraris.</p>
<h3 id="fly-vs.-fly">Fly vs. Fly</h3>
<p>Homer buys a matter <a href="Teleportation" title="wikilink">teleporter</a> from <a href="Professor_Frink" title="wikilink">Professor Frink</a>'s yard sale. Bart asks if he can use it, but Homer refuses. That night, Bart tries to sneak <a href="Snowball_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Snowball II</a> into the teleporter and at the same time, <a href="Santa&#39;s_Little_Helper" title="wikilink">Santa's Little Helper</a> jumps in. As the pets come out, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II have been merged into a two-headed creature (and the other body has 2 tails). A fly lands on Bart's arm and thinking that he will become a mutant superhero, Bart grabs the fly and steps into the teleporter. He comes out his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. The rest of the family wakes up and sees Bart's body with a fly's head and decide that it must still be Bart and accept him as he is. The real Bart tries to convince the fly into going back into the teleporter, but the fly attempts to eat Bart, who later enlists help from Lisa. The fly overhears their conversation and chases Lisa into the kitchen where it tries to kill her. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees this as an opportunity to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe, making it appear that he is about the destroy the machine, but then angrily chases Bart around the house for messing with it.</p>

<p><img src="THOH8Marge.png" title="fig:Marge, Patty and Selma as witches." alt="Marge, Patty and Selma as witches." width="200" /> In 1649, the town is witness to many <a href="Witch-hunt" title="wikilink">witch burnings</a>. In the <a href="Church_(building)" title="wikilink">church</a>, the townspeople try to figure out whom to condemn next. People start accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but <a href="Moe_Szyslak" title="wikilink">Moe</a> accuses her of being a witch. <a href="Mayor_Quimby" title="wikilink">Quimby</a> assures her that she is entitled to due process which means she will be thrown off a <a href="cliff" class="uri" title="wikilink">cliff</a> with a <a href="broomstick" class="uri" title="wikilink">broomstick</a>; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> tries to speak on her mother's behalf, but to no avail and Marge gets shoved off the cliff. They look and see that a green-skinned Marge is flying on the broomstick and really is a witch. She returns to her elder sisters <a href="Patty_Bouvier" title="wikilink">Patty</a> and <a href="Selma_Bouvier" title="wikilink">Selma</a> in their <a href="mountain" class="uri" title="wikilink">mountain</a> lair. The sisters watch <a href="Ned_Flanders" title="wikilink">Ned</a> and <a href="Maude_Flanders" title="wikilink">Maude Flanders</a> talking about how the witches may eat their children, and decide to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand the kids. Before they leave, Maude offers the witches <a href="gingerbread_men" title="wikilink">gingerbread men</a> instead. The witches like these better than the kids and let Rod and Todd go. They go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the kids. As they fly off, the <a href="Captain_Horatio_McAllister" title="wikilink">Sea Captain</a> says that is how the tradition of <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a> and <a href="trick-or-treating" class="uri" title="wikilink">trick-or-treating</a> started. The scene then jumps to years later in the same village where everyone is dressed in costumes. Homer and several others are egging a house for not responding before Lisa points out that it is their house. Homer then accuses her of being a witch and everybody proceeds to chase her.</p>

<p>The producers had trouble with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features Fox Censor the censor being stabbed to death and was pitched by <a href="David_Mirkin" title="wikilink">David Mirkin</a>, had a difficult time getting through the real life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Mr. Censor with a dagger, but FOX Network objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a curved sword.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
