<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Over the summer, <a href="Kevin_Malone" title="wikilink">Kevin</a> (<a href="Brian_Baumgartner" title="wikilink">Brian Baumgartner</a>) tried to save a turtle that he ran over, but only ends up killing it. <a href="Kelly_Kapoor" title="wikilink">Kelly Kapoor</a> (<a href="Mindy_Kaling" title="wikilink">Mindy Kaling</a>) moved to Ohio with her fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Ravi and <a href="Ryan_Howard" title="wikilink">Ryan Howard</a> (<a href="B._J._Novak" title="wikilink">B. J. Novak</a>) also moved to Ohio for &quot;unrelated reasons.&quot; <a href="Dwight_Schrute" title="wikilink">Dwight</a> (<a href="Rainn_Wilson" title="wikilink">Rainn Wilson</a>) learned that he is not the biological father of <a href="Angela_Martin" title="wikilink">Angela</a>'s (<a href="Angela_Kinsey" title="wikilink">Angela Kinsey</a>) baby.</p>
<p>While talking to the camera, <a href="Jim_Halpert" title="wikilink">Jim</a> (<a href="John_Krasinski" title="wikilink">John Krasinski</a>) and <a href="Pam_Halpert" title="wikilink">Pam</a> (<a href="Jenna_Fischer" title="wikilink">Jenna Fischer</a>) reveal that Jim was offered an <a href="entrepreneur" title="wikilink">entrepreneurial</a> sports job by his old college friend. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because it would not be good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.</p>
<p>Two new employees, Clark (<a href="Clark_Duke" title="wikilink">Clark Duke</a>) and Pete (<a href="Jake_Lacy" title="wikilink">Jake Lacy</a>), who are quickly dubbed &quot;Dwight, Jr.&quot; and &quot;The New Jim,&quot; are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for Jim and Dwight. At first, Dwight is happy to have a protege, but soon begins to fear that Clark is after his job. Jim, on the other hand, does not feel that Pete is anything like him. However, after hearing Pete discuss his future plans, Jim realizes that he used to have Pete's ambition but has become stuck at the same job for over nine years. Meanwhile, Angela puts one of her cats, Comstock, up for adoption as her baby is allergic to it. <a href="Oscar_Martinez_(The_Office)" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> (<a href="Oscar_Nunez" title="wikilink">Oscar Nunez</a>) initially refuses to adopt Comstock despite Angela's pleas, but agrees to adopt it after learning that it is her husband Robert's (<a href="Jack_Coleman" title="wikilink">Jack Coleman</a>) favorite cat. It is implied that Robert and Oscar are having an affair, as Robert told Angela he was having a business dinner on the night he actually had plans with Oscar.</p>
<p><a href="Andy_Bernard" title="wikilink">Andy Bernard</a> (<a href="Ed_Helms" title="wikilink">Ed Helms</a>) returns from <a href="Outward_Bound" title="wikilink">Outward Bound</a> manager training&lt;U+2014&gt;where he became more &quot;decisive and confident&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;hoping for revenge on <a href="Nellie_Bertram" title="wikilink">Nellie</a> (<a href="Catherine_Tate" title="wikilink">Catherine Tate</a>) for commandeering his job during <a href="The_Office_(U.S._season_8)" title="wikilink">the previous spring</a>. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline in the parking lot and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while <a href="Creed_Bratton_(The_Office)" title="wikilink">Creed</a> (<a href="Creed_Bratton" title="wikilink">Creed Bratton</a>) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants to be involved in the new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.</p>

<p>The official website of <em>The Office</em> included several cut scenes from &quot;New Guys&quot; within a week of the episode's release.

<p>Erik Adams of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V.

Fearing the prophecy, Laius abandons his son, Oedipus', who is raised in the city of Thebes. Oedipus later crosses paths with Laius and gets into a fight and, not knowing that Laius is his father, kills him.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Adams, thus, states that the &quot;break-room conversation&quot; Dwight and Clark share starts to make Dwight paranoid and fear that Clark is after his job.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Many reviewers noted that the episode made references to previous episodes of the series.

[...] All <em>The Office</em> needs to do now is march out proudly random, zany and off-center.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> <a href="HitFix" class="uri" title="wikilink">HitFix</a>'s <a href="Alan_Sepinwall" title="wikilink">Alan Sepinwall</a>, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it &quot;didn't give me a lot of hope for a last-minute resurgence&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Matt Roush of <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> wrote that the &quot;one interesting storyline&quot; may make him watch the remainder of Pam and Jim's story, but not &quot;the rest of this sadly played-out workplace comedy.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Many reviews were complimentary towards the interaction Pam and Jim had with the cameramen. Silverberg called it &quot;a nice surprise&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Tucker called the sequence one of the &quot;biggest reveals&quot; in the episode.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Sepinwall, despite being critical of the episode's humor, found the sub-plot &quot;interesting&quot;. He called it &quot;a character arc I've been waiting for the show to remember to do for years now, and the scenes here were promising (if not incredibly funny)&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
