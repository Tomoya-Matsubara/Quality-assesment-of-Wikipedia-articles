<p>Waddy's position was changed to Minister for Youth and Community Services in January 1973. In September he piloted a bill to reorganise the Ministries of Child Welfare and Social Welfare as the Department of Youth and Community Services; the move was designed to &quot;revitalise&quot; and re-focus welfare services, and to remove &quot;overtones of charity and paternalism&quot; inherent in the earlier titles.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Waddy was succeeded by <a href="Dick_Healey" title="wikilink">Dick Healey</a> on 3 December 1973, and took over as <a href="Minister_for_Health_(New_South_Wales)" title="wikilink">Minister for Health</a> from <a href="Harry_Jago" title="wikilink">Harry Jago</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> On 3 January 1975, he was appointed <a href="Minister_for_Police_and_Emergency_Services_(New_South_Wales)" title="wikilink">Minister for Police</a> and <a href="Minister_for_Police_and_Emergency_Services_(New_South_Wales)" title="wikilink">Minister for Services</a> under new Premier <a href="Tom_Lewis_(Australian_politician)" title="wikilink">Tom Lewis</a>, serving until 23 January the following year.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In this portfolio he sponsored an amendment to the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Bill, including provisions to close polling booths at 6 pm rather than 8 pm to expedite the reporting of results, and to change the term &quot;Christian name&quot; to &quot;Given name&quot; on candidate nominations to reflect changing community attitudes.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> He also put through a bill to hold a referendum on whether to make daylight saving a permanent fixture in New South Wales, following trials that had commenced in 1971.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Described by one of his parliamentary colleagues as a &quot;mixture of <em>bon vivant</em> and conservatism&quot;, Waddy was also known for an occasionally quick temper; his staff were said to &quot;start making motions as though they were bombing and strafing the enemy&quot; when their boss got &quot;wound up&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Cutler" title="wikilink">Charles Cutler</a>, Deputy Premier from 1965 to 1975, reflecting on the bond between ex-servicemen in the political arena, recalled Waddy as &quot;a great bloke, but inclined to be a bit pompous when speaking in the house ...&quot;,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> while <a href="John_David_Booth" title="wikilink">John Booth</a> found him to have an &quot;old-fashioned sense of service to the community&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Waddy was named a <a href="List_of_Honorary_Freemen_of_the_City_of_London" title="wikilink">Freeman of the City of London</a> in 1972, and <a href="Australian_Father_of_the_Year_award" title="wikilink">Australian Father of the Year</a> in 1973.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Having held his state seat in Kirribilli for fourteen years and four re-election campaigns&lt;U+2014&gt;in 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1973&lt;U+2014&gt;he was denied preselection by the Liberal Party for the <a href="New_South_Wales_state_election,_1976" title="wikilink">1976 contest</a>.
