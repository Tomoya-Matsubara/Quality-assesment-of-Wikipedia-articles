<p>The <strong>White House FBI files controversy</strong> of the <a href="Clinton_Administration" title="wikilink">Clinton Administration</a>, often referred to as <strong>Filegate</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a>'s Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> administrations, including top presidential advisors. Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady <a href="Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" title="wikilink">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.</p>
<p>The matter was investigated by the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Government_Reform" title="wikilink">House Government Reform and Oversight Committee</a>, the <a href="Senate_Judiciary_Committee" title="wikilink">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, and the <a href="Whitewater_(controversy)" title="wikilink">Whitewater</a> <a href="Independent_Counsel" title="wikilink">Independent Counsel</a>. In 1998, Independent Counsel <a href="Kenneth_Starr" title="wikilink">Kenneth Starr</a> exonerated President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton of any involvement in the matter. In 2000 Independent Counsel <a href="Robert_Ray_(prosecutor)" title="wikilink">Robert Ray</a> issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that senior White House figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring. A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by <a href="Judicial_Watch" title="wikilink">Judicial Watch</a>, a <a href="American_conservatism" title="wikilink">conservative</a> <a href="watchdog_group" title="wikilink">watchdog group</a>, has lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.</p>

The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the <a href="United_States_Secret_Service" title="wikilink">United States Secret Service</a>,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Rather, its role was to keep track of who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> campaigns and transitions,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and his only prior job in the &quot;security&quot; field was that of a local <a href="bar_(establishment)" title="wikilink">bar</a> <a href="bouncer_(doorman)" title="wikilink">bouncer</a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> at a <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="night_club" title="wikilink">night club</a>.

<p>An FBI document suggested that Livingstone had been given his position because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was a friend of Livingstone's mother and recommended him.

Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying &quot;while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [we] found no evidence that anyone higher [than Livingstone or Marceca] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the <a href="United_States_House_elections,_1998" title="wikilink">1998 Congressional elections</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>)</p>
<p>In March 2000, Independent Counsel <a href="Robert_Ray_(prosecutor)" title="wikilink">Robert Ray</a>, Starr's successor, issued the office's final report on the matter, as part of a concerted effort to wrap up all Whitewater-related cases before the end of Bill Clinton's term.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It attributed the improper collection of the files by Marceca due to his having an outdated Secret Service list of White House passes, as Marceca had originally claimed.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> It stated that even though Marceca's statements were sometimes &quot;contradictory and misleading&quot;,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> they were &quot;sufficiently transparent&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and there was insufficient evidence to prove that Anthony Marceca had made false statements to Congress during his testimony.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The report ascribed the FBI files matter to &quot;a failure of process at many levels,&quot; saying that the Secret Service had provided critically erroneous data,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and that this was compounded by the White House's informal process of requesting sensitive information by &quot;inexperienced, untrained, and unsupervised personnel with backgrounds as political operatives.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Based on an investigation that included the prior fingerprint analysis,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> the report further stated that:</p>

<p>Ray's report also concluded that there was no credible evidence that Bernard Nussbaum testified falsely about not having discussed Livingstone's hiring with the First Lady, and found as well that there was no personal relationship between the First Lady and Livingstone that had formed the basis for his hiring.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
