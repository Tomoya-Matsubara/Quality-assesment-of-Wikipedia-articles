<p><strong>William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_Thistle" title="wikilink">KT</a> <a href="Privy_Council_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">PC</a> (1675 &lt;U+2013&gt; 17 July 1726) was a noted military officer in the army of <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</a> during the <a href="War_of_the_Spanish_Succession" title="wikilink">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. He commanded the prestigious <a href="Grenadier_Guards" title="wikilink">1st Foot Guards</a> for some time.</p>
<p>He is also said to be the first Englishman to have owned the later so called &quot;Cadogan Tea Pot&quot;, which is a lidless teapot, inspired by Chinese wine pots, that is &lt;U+FB01&gt;lled from the bottom. It has an upside-down funnel opening at the bottom that prevents the liquid from leaking out.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>The eldest son of barrister <a href="Henry_Cadogan" title="wikilink">Henry Cadogan</a>, he was educated at <a href="Westminster_School" title="wikilink">Westminster School</a> and <a href="Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, and joined the army in 1690. He served in Ireland at the sieges of <a href="Cork_(city)" title="wikilink">Cork</a> and <a href="Kinsale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kinsale</a> where he first served with Marlborough, then an Earl, and by 1701 was a <a href="Major" class="uri" title="wikilink">Major</a> of the Inniskilling Dragoons.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-of-the-spanish-succession">War of the Spanish Succession</h2>
<p>In 1701, Cadogan was appointed <a href="quartermaster_general" title="wikilink">quartermaster general</a> to Marlborough on the latter's appointment to command the English troops in the Low Countries.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During the campaign of 1704, he was one of the few entrusted with the truth of Marlborough's march from the Spanish Netherlands to the Danube<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and played a major role in the organisation of the march.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He fought at the battles of the <a href="Battle_of_Schellenberg" title="wikilink">Schellenberg</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Blenheim" title="wikilink">Blenheim</a>. He commanded the army's scouting part which located the French army on the morning of <a href="Battle_of_Ramillies" title="wikilink">Ramillies</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and acted as a senior messenger for Marlborough during the battle, recalling <a href="George_Hamilton,_1st_Earl_of_Orkney" title="wikilink">Orkney's</a> British infantry from their diversionary attack on the French right flank to assault the French centre around Ramillies itself.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At <a href="Battle_of_Oudenarde" title="wikilink">Oudenarde</a> he commanded the allied advance guard, which established crossings over the <a href="River_Scheldt" title="wikilink">River Scheldt</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and later commanded the forces which broke through the French left towards the end of the battle.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He fought at <a href="Battle_of_Malplaquet" title="wikilink">Malplaquet</a>, and was wounded in the neck at the siege of Mons, but quickly recovered.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During the <a href="Siege_of_Bouchain" title="wikilink">breaking of the lines of Ne Plus Ultra</a>, he again commanded the allied advance guard, and established a bridgehead across the lines prior to Marlborough's arrival with the main army.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After Marlborough's dismissal from his posts at the end of 1711 Cadogan remained with the army, but refused to return with it when Britain withdrew from war in 1712, going into voluntary exile with the Duke.</p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>During Marlborough's voluntary exile during the last years of Queen Anne's reign, Cadogan accompanied him, and often acted as a go-between to maintain Marlborough's links with Britain.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> When the Hanoverian King <a href="George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">George I</a> succeeded in 1714, Cadogan received military favours from the Crown, and in 1715 he replaced the <a href="John_Campbell,_2nd_Duke_of_Argyll" title="wikilink">Duke of Argyll</a> in command of the army putting down a <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> <a href="Jacobite_Risings#The_Rebellion/Rising_of_1715_(&#39;The_Fifteen&#39;)" title="wikilink">rising</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>On 21 June 1716, he was made Baron Cadogan of <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a>, having recently purchased <a href="Caversham_Park" title="wikilink">Caversham Park</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxfordshire</a> (now <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>) near that town. He was also made a <a href="Knight_of_the_Thistle" title="wikilink">Knight of the Thistle</a> and, the following year, a member of the <a href="Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a>. (He was a <a href="British_Whig_Party" title="wikilink">Whig</a> MP for <a href="Woodstock_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a> from 1705 to 1716.) On 8 May 1718 George I made him 1st Baron Cadogan, of <a href="Oakley,_Buckinghamshire" title="wikilink">Oakley</a>, co. <a href="Buckinghamshire" title="wikilink">Buckingham</a>, Viscount Caversham, of Caversham, co. <a href="Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and Earl Cadogan. In later years he also served as <a href="Master_of_the_Robes" title="wikilink">Master of the Robes</a> (1714&lt;U+2013&gt;1726), Governor of the <a href="Isle_of_Wight" title="wikilink">Isle of Wight</a> (1715&lt;U+2013&gt;1726) and <a href="Master-General_of_the_Ordnance" title="wikilink">Master-General of the Ordnance</a> (1722&lt;U+2013&gt;1725). However, the Opposition's staunch hostility towards him meant that he had lost any political influence several years before his death on 17 July 1726.</p>

<p>He married Margaret Cecilia Munter in April 1704 at <a href="The_Hague" title="wikilink">The Hague</a>. They had two daughters: <a href="Sarah_Lennox,_Duchess_of_Richmond_and_Lennox" title="wikilink">Sarah</a> (born 18 September 1705), who married <a href="Charles_Lennox,_2nd_Duke_of_Richmond" title="wikilink">Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond</a>, and Margaret (born 21 February 1707), who married the Hon. Charles John Bentinck, fourth son of <a href="William_Bentinck,_1st_Earl_of_Portland" title="wikilink">William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
