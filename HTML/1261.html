<p>Brown faced the <a href="U.S._Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General <a href="Martha_Coakley" title="wikilink">Martha Coakley</a>, in the <a href="United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Massachusetts,_2010" title="wikilink">2010 special election</a> to succeed U.S. Senator <a href="Ted_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Ted Kennedy</a>. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown closed the gap in the first weeks of January 2010 before going on to win the election. Brown became the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since <a href="Edward_Brooke" title="wikilink">Edward Brooke</a> in 1972.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In June 1982, Brown, then a 22-year-old law student at Boston College, won <em><a href="Cosmopolitan_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Cosmopolitan</a></em> magazine's &quot;America's Sexiest Man&quot; contest. After two weeks on a <a href="crash_diet" title="wikilink">crash diet</a> of &quot;three cans of tuna a day&quot; and intensive workouts<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> he was featured in the magazine's <a href="centerfold" class="uri" title="wikilink">centerfold</a>, posing <a href="nude" class="uri" title="wikilink">nude</a> but strategically positioned so that according to Brown, &quot;You don't see anything&quot;. In the accompanying interview, he referred to himself as &quot;a bit of a patriot&quot; and stated that he had political ambitions. The <em>Cosmopolitan</em> appearance and its $1,000 fee<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> helped pay for law school, and began for Brown a &quot;long, lucrative&quot; part-time catalog and print modeling career in New York and Boston during the 1980s.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-political-career">Early political career</h2>
<p>Brown &quot;caught the political bug&quot; in 1992 when he was elected property <a href="assessor_(property)" title="wikilink">assessor</a> of <a href="Wrentham,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Wrentham, Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1995, he was elected to the Wrentham <a href="Board_of_Selectmen" title="wikilink">Board of Selectmen</a>.</p>
<p>He successfully ran for the <a href="Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> in 1998, representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms. Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat <a href="Cheryl_Jacques" title="wikilink">Cheryl Jacques</a>. Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59&lt;U+2013&gt;41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts senate. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2007, a controversy arose after Brown's appearance at <a href="King_Philip_Regional_High_School" title="wikilink">King Philip Regional High School</a> in <a href="Wrentham,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Wrentham, Massachusetts</a> as part of a debate on <a href="gay_marriage" title="wikilink">gay marriage</a>. The high school students had launched a <a href="Facebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facebook</a> group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, <a href="Ayla_Brown" title="wikilink">Ayla</a>. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> reported that during six terms in the Legislature, three each in the House and Senate, Brown has a modest record of legislative initiatives, but he has carved out a niche as a leading advocate for <a href="veterans" class="uri" title="wikilink">veterans</a>. <a href="Richard_R._Tisei" title="wikilink">Richard R. Tisei</a> of <a href="Wakefield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Wakefield, Massachusetts</a>, the leader of the Republican minority in the state Senate, called Brown &quot;the acknowledged expert on veterans' issues.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> State Senator <a href="Jack_Hart_(state_senator)" title="wikilink">Jack Hart</a>, a Democrat of <a href="South_Boston" title="wikilink">South Boston</a>, said: &quot;He does his homework, he's comprehensive in his approach, and on veterans' issues, he's one of them and has done a very good job on their behalf.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>As a legislator, Brown lists among his achievements his authorship of a 2007 law that created a check-off box on state income tax forms for veterans to indicate whether they served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits, including the Welcome Home Bonus<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> that provides $1,000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Scott_P._Brown.jpg" title="fig:Brown on the campaign trail." alt="Brown on the campaign trail." width="200" /> On September 12, 2009, Brown announced his run for the U.S. Senate seat that became vacant with the death of <a href="Ted_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Ted Kennedy</a>, saying the state &quot;needs an independent thinker.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Washington Post</em> columnist <a href="Kathleen_Parker" title="wikilink">Kathleen Parker</a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> said that Brown's political positions did not fall neatly into party lines, and called Brown &quot;mainstream in a nation that defines itself as mostly conservative&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Boris Shor, political scientist at the <a href="Harris_School_of_Public_Policy" title="wikilink">Harris School of Public Policy</a>, described Brown as a liberal Republican by national standards, but well-suited for his Massachusetts constituency.

<p>Brown won a landslide victory in the Republican primary on December 8, 2009, defeating late entrant and <a href="perennial_candidate" title="wikilink">perennial candidate</a> <a href="Jack_E._Robinson_III" title="wikilink">Jack E.

<p>Brown's opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and <a href="independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">independent</a> <a href="Joseph_L._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Joseph L. Kennedy</a> (no relation to the <a href="Kennedy_family" title="wikilink">Kennedy family</a>). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A week before the general election, Brown raised $1.3 million from over 16,000 donors in a 24-hour <a href="money_bomb" title="wikilink">money bomb</a>.

The Rothenberg Political Report released a statement that &quot;the combination of public and private survey research and anecdotal information now strongly suggests that Republican Scott Brown will defeat Democrat Martha Coakley in tomorrow's race&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <a href="Suffolk_University" title="wikilink">Suffolk University</a>'s polling of three <a href="bellwether" class="uri" title="wikilink">bellwether</a> counties on January 18 had Brown leading Coakley by double-digit margins.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Brown won the January 19 election, performing well in traditional Republican strongholds and holding rival Coakley's margins down in many Democratic precincts.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Senator_Scott_Brown_2010.jpg" title="fig:Brown driving what during the campaign became his famous truck" alt="Brown driving what during the campaign became his famous truck" /> One week before the January special election, a controversy arose over a Coakley approved television ad. The ad referenced the <a href="conscientious_objector" title="wikilink">conscientious objector</a> amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care to rape victims if they objected due to a <a href="religious_belief" title="wikilink">religious belief</a>. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, &quot;Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims,&quot; over the ad's graphic which had the words, &quot;Deny care to rape victims.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Brown's daughter <a href="Ayla_Brown" title="wikilink">Ayla</a> called the Coakley ad &quot;completely inaccurate and misleading&quot;, and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim. Brown criticized Coakley for running what he described as attack ads.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 2010 Senate race, although Brown was not endorsed by the Greater Boston Tea Party group,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> the group organized a fund-raising breakfast for him in Boston.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The Tea Party Express also endorsed Brown<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and bought ads on the national cable networks supporting Brown.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>When told that at various times he has been labeled a <a href="Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">conservative</a>, <a href="moderate" class="uri" title="wikilink">moderate</a> and a <a href="Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">liberal</a> Republican, he responded &quot;I'm a Scott Brown Republican.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> According to Politifact, while Brown was a Massachusetts legislator, he voted about 90 percent with the state Republican leadership;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> however, Republican Leadership in the Massachusetts legislature is generally considered far more moderate than the national Republican Party.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="fiscal-policy">Fiscal policy</h3>
<p>Brown opposes a proposed multi-billion dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, said that he is &quot;opposed to higher taxes, especially in the midst of a <a href="recession_of_2008" title="wikilink">severe recession</a>&quot;. He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and <a href="Automated_teller_machine" title="wikilink">ATM</a> fees.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like <a href="Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program" title="wikilink">TARP</a>, stating: &quot;Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our economy moving again.&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 12, 2010, the <em><a href="Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">Boston Globe</a></em> reported that &quot;[c]ampaign contributions to [Brown] from the financial industry spiked sharply during a critical three-week period last summer as the fate of the <a href="Dodd&lt;U+2013&gt;Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act" title="wikilink">Wall Street regulatory overhaul</a> hung in the balance and Brown used the leverage of his swing vote to win key concessions sought by firms.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Brown received more than ten times the amount of contributions from the <a href="financial_services_industry" title="wikilink">financial services industry</a> as <a href="House_Financial_Services_Committee" title="wikilink">House Financial Services Committee</a> chairman (and author of the legislation) <a href="Barney_Frank" title="wikilink">Barney Frank</a> during the same period.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">Globe</a></em>:</p>

<h3 id="veteran-services">Veteran services</h3>
<p>In 2007, Brown wrote a law establishing a check off box on State income tax forms to allow a filer to indicate if he or she is a veteran of the <a href="Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iraq</a> or <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a> wars. The measure's purpose is to locate and inform returning veterans of benefits they qualify for. Known as the &quot;Welcome Home&quot; bonus, it was passed with <a href="bipartisan" class="uri" title="wikilink">bipartisan</a> support.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Brown also amended the <a href="Dodd&lt;U+2013&gt;Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act" title="wikilink">Dodd&lt;U+2013&gt;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>, with Senator <a href="Jack_Reed_(politician)" title="wikilink">Jack Reed</a> (<a href="Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">RI</a>), to create a dedicated military liaison office within the newly formed <a href="Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau" title="wikilink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, which aside from defending against unscrupulous lenders, also ensures protection of military families against fraudulent life insurance policies.

<h3 id="health-care">Health care</h3>
<p>Brown supported the 2006 <a href="Massachusetts_health_care_reform" title="wikilink">Massachusetts health care reform</a>, which requires all residents to have <a href="health_insurance" title="wikilink">health insurance</a>, with a state-subsidized plan created for those who cannot afford to insure themselves. Brown does not support President Obama's health care reform plan in its current form as approved by the Democratic-led House and Senate. He has stated this plan is fiscally unsound, and during his campaign notably pledged to be the 41st vote to <a href="filibuster" class="uri" title="wikilink">filibuster</a> the bill in the Senate.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Brown voted for a state measure on patients' rights that, among other provisions, requires emergency rooms to provide what is known as the <a href="emergency_contraception" title="wikilink">morning-after pill</a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> to rape victims to prevent an unwanted pregnancy from developing. In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication, Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious Objector amendment which would have exempted these workers, as well as religious hospitals, from being required to provide this medication. However, Brown's amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication, either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication, or, in the case of religious hospitals, to provide transportation to another facility, and in a timely manner.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The amendment did not pass.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Brown remains in favor of allowing religious hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraception on moral or religious grounds, as he stated in the January 5, 2010 candidate debate.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="social-issues">Social issues</h3>
<p>Brown refers to the currently legalized <a href="same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage in Massachusetts</a> as a settled issue, which he does not wish to change.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Brown has said he personally believes marriage is between a man and a woman, but would oppose a constitutional amendment banning <a href="gay_marriage" title="wikilink">gay marriage</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> He is in favor of <a href="Civil_union_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">civil unions</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He opposes ending the <a href="Defense_of_Marriage_Act" title="wikilink">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, but otherwise favors leaving the issue to the states to decide.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> After initially claiming neutrality on &quot;<a href="don&#39;t_ask,_don&#39;t_tell" title="wikilink">don't ask, don't tell</a>&quot;, the ban on openly gay military personnel,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> he joined a handful of Republicans who broke with their party to repeal the ban in December 2010.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
