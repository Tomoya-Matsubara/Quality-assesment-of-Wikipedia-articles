The six existing teams were grouped into the newly created <a href="East_Division_(NHL)" title="wikilink">East Division</a>, and the expansion teams&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a>, <a href="Minnesota_North_Stars" title="wikilink">Minnesota North Stars</a>, <a href="Oakland_Seals" title="wikilink">Oakland Seals</a>, <a href="Philadelphia_Flyers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh_Penguins" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Blues_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">St. Louis Blues</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;formed the <a href="West_Division_(NHL)" title="wikilink">West Division</a>.</p>
<p>The NHL added another six teams by 1974 to bring the league to 18 teams. This continued expansion was partially brought about by the creation of the <a href="World_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA), which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. <a href="Bobby_Hull" title="wikilink">Bobby Hull</a> was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the <a href="Winnipeg_Jets" title="wikilink">Winnipeg Jets</a>. When the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the NHL absorbed four of the league's teams&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Edmonton_Oilers" title="wikilink">Edmonton Oilers</a>, <a href="Hartford_Whalers" title="wikilink">Hartford Whalers</a>, <a href="Quebec_Nordiques" title="wikilink">Quebec Nordiques</a> and Winnipeg Jets. This brought the NHL to 21 teams (the <a href="Cleveland_Barons_(NHL)" title="wikilink">Cleveland Barons</a> had ceased operations in 1978), a figure that remained constant until the <a href="San_Jose_Sharks" title="wikilink">San Jose Sharks</a> joined as an expansion franchise in 1991.</p>
<p>The NHL became involved in international play, starting with the <a href="Summit_Series" title="wikilink">Summit Series</a> in 1972, which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Canada won the eight-game series four wins to three with one tie. The success of the series led to the creation of the <a href="Canada_Cup_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Canada Cup</a>, held five times between 1976 and 1991. NHL teams also faced <a href="Russian_Super_League" title="wikilink">Soviet League</a> teams that toured North America between 1975 and 1991 in what was known as the <a href="Super_Series" title="wikilink">Super Series</a>. The fall of the <a href="Iron_Curtain" title="wikilink">Iron Curtain</a> in 1989 saw many former Soviet-Bloc players stream into the NHL, joining several players who had defected in the 1980s.</p>
<p>This was one of the highest scoring periods in NHL history. It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and <a href="Wayne_Gretzky" title="wikilink">Wayne Gretzky</a>, who scored 200 points or more four times, including a current league-record 215 in <a href="1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1985&lt;U+2013&gt;86</a>. Gretzky's 92 goals in <a href="1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82</a> also remains a league record. No other player in NHL history has scored 200 points, although <a href="Mario_Lemieux" title="wikilink">Mario Lemieux</a> came close in <a href="1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89</a> with 199.  </p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Expansion had been a major topic of discussion among NHL owners since 1963, when <a href="William_M._Jennings" title="wikilink">William M. Jennings</a> of the <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="wikilink">New York Rangers</a> proposed adding two new teams on the <a href="West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">West Coast</a> to counter fears that the <a href="Western_Hockey_League_(minor_pro)" title="wikilink">Western Hockey League</a> intended to compete as a major league.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After several years of discussion, the NHL announced in February 1966 that it would expand by six teams, doubling the league's size. The <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a>, <a href="Minnesota_North_Stars" title="wikilink">Minnesota North Stars</a>, <a href="California_Golden_Seals" title="wikilink">California Seals</a>, <a href="Philadelphia_Flyers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh_Penguins" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Blues_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">St. Louis Blues</a> began play in the <a href="1967&lt;U+2013&gt;68_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1967&lt;U+2013&gt;68 season</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> They formed the newly created <a href="West_Division_(NHL)" title="wikilink">West Division</a>, and the existing teams were grouped into the <a href="East_Division_(NHL)" title="wikilink">East Division</a>. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the <a href="Stanley_Cup" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup</a> Finals.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The <a href="Clarence_S._Campbell_Bowl" title="wikilink">Clarence S. Campbell Bowl</a> was created in honour of league president <a href="Clarence_Campbell" title="wikilink">Clarence Campbell</a>, and was awarded to the West Division champion.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The new teams were stocked by the NHL's first <a href="1967_NHL_Expansion_Draft" title="wikilink">expansion draft</a>, as each team selected 20 players from the existing franchises. There was much debate over how many players each existing team could protect: the strongest clubs wished to protect more players, while the weaker clubs hoped that protecting fewer players would help improve the balance of competition. <a href="Montreal_Canadiens" title="wikilink">Montreal Canadiens</a> manager <a href="Sam_Pollock" title="wikilink">Sam Pollock</a>'s suggestion to allow each team to protect eleven players to start, then add an additional player to their protected list for each player selected in the draft, was ultimately agreed to as a compromise solution.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition, an &quot;intra-league draft&quot; was held following the 1968 and 1969 seasons to help accelerate the improvement of the expansion teams. Each team protected two goaltenders and fourteen skaters, leaving their remaining players open to be selected by any other team.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Some teams created instant <a href="farm_system" title="wikilink">farm systems</a> by buying existing minor league franchises. The Kings bought the <a href="Springfield_Indians" title="wikilink">Springfield Indians</a> of the <a href="American_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">American Hockey League</a> the night before the expansion draft, leading the Flyers to purchase the <a href="Quebec_Aces" title="wikilink">Quebec Aces</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Expansion also changed how the <a href="NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">amateur draft</a> was handled. The old system, in which franchises sponsored junior teams and players, was abandoned by 1969 when all junior-aged players were made eligible for the entry draft.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished atop the West Division, recording 73 points in 74 games.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The California Seals, a pre-season favourite to win the division, changed their name to the Oakland Seals a month into the season. The team disappointed both on the ice and at the gate, finishing last in the NHL with 14 wins.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Blues defeated the Flyers and North Stars to become the first expansion team to play for the Stanley Cup, where they were defeated in four consecutive games by the Canadiens.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The Blues reached the finals again in both <a href="1969_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1969</a> and <a href="1970_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1970</a>, but were similarly swept in both years, losing to the Canadiens and <a href="Boston_Bruins" title="wikilink">Boston Bruins</a>, respectively.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie <a href="Bill_Masterton" title="wikilink">Bill Masterton</a> became the first and, to date, only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Early in a game against the Seals, Masterton was checked hard by two players, <a href="Ron_Harris_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Ron Harris</a> and <a href="Larry_Cahan" title="wikilink">Larry Cahan</a>, causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the <a href="Bill_Masterton_Memorial_Trophy" title="wikilink">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a> later in the season; the trophy is awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets; starting in the <a href="1979&lt;U+2013&gt;80_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1979&lt;U+2013&gt;80 season</a>, the league mandated that all players entering the league wear them.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bobby-orr">Bobby Orr</h3>
<p><img src="Orr.jpg" title="fig:Bobby Orr flies through the air after scoring the Stanley Cup winning goal, May 10, 1970." alt="Bobby Orr flies through the air after scoring the Stanley Cup winning goal, May 10, 1970." /> In the <a href="1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69 season</a>, second-year defenceman <a href="Bobby_Orr" title="wikilink">Bobby Orr</a> scored 21 goals, an NHL record for a defenceman, en route to winning his first of eight consecutive <a href="James_Norris_Memorial_Trophy" title="wikilink">Norris Trophies</a> as the league's top defenceman.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At the same time, Orr's teammate, <a href="Phil_Esposito" title="wikilink">Phil Esposito</a>, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126 points. He was one of three players to break the century mark that year, including <a href="Bobby_Hull" title="wikilink">Bobby Hull</a> and 41-year old <a href="Gordie_Howe" title="wikilink">Gordie Howe</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive side of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Orr scored the Stanley-Cup-winning goal in overtime of the fourth game against the Blues in 1970, which gave the Bruins their first championship in 29 years. The goal was highlighted by his famous flight through the air after being tripped up following his shot.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Orr twice won the <a href="Art_Ross_Trophy" title="wikilink">Art Ross Trophy</a> as the NHL's leading scorer, still the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. His <a href="plus/minus" class="uri" title="wikilink">plus/minus</a> of +124 in <a href="1970&lt;U+2013&gt;71_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1970&lt;U+2013&gt;71</a> is a league record.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Orr signed a five-year contract that paid him $200,000 per season in 1971, the first $1 million contract in league history.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career. In 1972, he tore ligaments in his left knee after a hard hit, leading to the first of six knee operations.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He played 12 seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270 goals and 915 points in 657 games and won the <a href="Hart_Memorial_Trophy" title="wikilink">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> as the league's <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> three times.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The customary three-year post-retirement waiting period for entry into the <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was waived as he was enshrined in 1979.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="buffalo-and-vancouver">Buffalo and Vancouver</h3>
<p>In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Three years later, the NHL added a third Canadian team when the <a href="Vancouver_Canucks" title="wikilink">Vancouver Canucks</a>, formerly of the <a href="Western_Hockey_League_(minor_pro)" title="wikilink">Western Hockey League</a>, were admitted as an expansion team for the <a href="1970&lt;U+2013&gt;71_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1970&lt;U+2013&gt;71 season</a>, along with the <a href="Buffalo_Sabres" title="wikilink">Buffalo Sabres</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The Canucks were placed in the East Division, despite being on the west coast, while the <a href="Chicago_Black_Hawks" title="wikilink">Chicago Black Hawks</a> were shifted to the West in an attempt to equalize the divisions' strength.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The league also gave the Sabres and Canucks the first two picks in the <a href="1970_NHL_Amateur_Draft" title="wikilink">1970 NHL Amateur Draft</a>, offering them a better opportunity to build their rosters than the 1967 expansion teams had.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Beliveau finished his 18-year career with 10 Stanley Cups, 2 Hart Trophies and 1,219 career points; his points total was the second-highest in NHL history. After playing 25 seasons in the NHL, Howe retired as the league's all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Howe was a six-time league scoring champion, and also won six Hart Trophies.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Both players had the customary three-year waiting period waived for entry into the <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in acknowledgement of their achievements.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="world-hockey-association">World Hockey Association</h2>
<p>In 1972, the NHL faced competition from the newly formed <a href="World_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from the NHL, including <a href="Derek_Sanderson" title="wikilink">Derek Sanderson</a>, <a href="J._C._Tremblay" title="wikilink">J. C. Tremblay</a> and <a href="Ted_Green" title="wikilink">Ted Green</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The WHA's biggest coup was to lure <a href="Bobby_Hull" title="wikilink">Bobby Hull</a> from the Black Hawks to play for the <a href="Winnipeg_Jets" title="wikilink">Winnipeg Jets</a>. Hull signed a 10-year deal: five years as a player for $250,000 per season, and five more for $100,000 per season in a front-office position. It also included a $1 million signing bonus. The deal totaled $2.7 million, and lent instant credibility to the new league.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit. <a href="Bernie_Parent" title="wikilink">Bernie Parent</a>, <a href="Gerry_Cheevers" title="wikilink">Gerry Cheevers</a>, <a href="John_McKenzie_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Johnny McKenzie</a> and <a href="Rick_Ley" title="wikilink">Rick Ley</a> jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> By the time the <a href="1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73_WHA_season" title="wikilink">1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73 WHA season</a> began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Defections continued following the season, and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe's sons <a href="Mark_Howe" title="wikilink">Mark</a> and <a href="Marty_Howe" title="wikilink">Marty</a>. The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to play with them on the <a href="Houston_Aeros" title="wikilink">Houston Aeros</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The NHL tried to block several of the defections. The Bruins attempted to restrain Cheevers and Sanderson from joining the WHA, though a United States federal court refused to prohibit the signings. The Black Hawks were successful in having a restraining order filed against Hull and the Jets pending the outcome of legal action the Black Hawks were taking against the WHA. The WHA was eager for the court action, intending to challenge the legality of the reserve clause, which bound a player to their NHL team until that team released him.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In November 1972, a Philadelphia district court placed an injunction against the NHL, preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them, including Hull, to play with their WHA clubs. The decision effectively ended the NHL's monopoly on major league professional hockey talent.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA posed changed this. Hoping to keep the WHA out of the newly completed <a href="Nassau_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> in <a href="Uniondale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Uniondale, New York</a> and the <a href="Omni_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Omni Coliseum</a> in <a href="Atlanta" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, the league hastily announced the creation of the <a href="New_York_Islanders" title="wikilink">New York Islanders</a> and <a href="Atlanta_Flames" title="wikilink">Atlanta Flames</a> as <a href="1972_NHL_Expansion_Draft" title="wikilink">1972 expansion teams</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Following the <a href="1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73 season</a>, the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18-teams for the <a href="1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75 season</a>, adding the <a href="Kansas_City_Scouts" title="wikilink">Kansas City Scouts</a> and <a href="Washington_Capitals" title="wikilink">Washington Capitals</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In just eight years, the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams.</p>

<p>The tournament was the NHL's response to the defection of players to the WHA.

<p>The series forced the NHL and the <a href="Canadian_Amateur_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">Canadian Amateur Hockey Association</a> to reassess all aspects of how the game was played in North America.

The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that ...

Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the <a href="1989_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">1989 NHL Entry Draft</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The entire &quot;KLM&quot; line, the Soviet team's top line, joined the NHL in 1989 as <a href="Vladimir_Krutov" title="wikilink">Vladimir Krutov</a> and <a href="Igor_Larionov" title="wikilink">Igor Larionov</a> played for the Canucks, while <a href="Sergei_Makarov" title="wikilink">Sergei Makarov</a> went to Calgary.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Makarov won the <a href="Calder_Memorial_Trophy" title="wikilink">Calder Memorial Trophy</a> as rookie of the year in 1990, a selection that caused controversy; he was 32 years old and had played 11 pro seasons in the Soviet League.

<h2 id="rules-and-innovations">Rules and innovations</h2>
<p>The early 1980s saw many tie games. The <a href="1982&lt;U+2013&gt;83_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1982&lt;U+2013&gt;83</a> North Stars and Capitals both finished with 16 ties in 80 games, while 17 of 21 teams tied 10 or more games. The season before, the North Stars recorded 20 ties. As a result of the frequent ties, the NHL reintroduced <a href="Overtime_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">overtime</a> for the <a href="1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84 season</a>. The effect was immediate, as only seven teams had ten or more ties. Before its discontinuation during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the NHL played a full 10-minute overtime period. The modern overtime format was set as a five-minute, sudden death period; the game ended when either team scored.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>The NHL changed its divisional alignment and playoff formats numerous times as it grew. The league's doubling in 1967 also led to the expansion of the playoffs to eight teams from four the previous year.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Expansion to 18 teams in 1974 caused the league to realign into two conferences and four divisions, each named after important figures in league history. The teams were split into the <a href="Campbell_Conference" title="wikilink">Campbell Conference</a>, consisting of the <a href="Patrick_Division" title="wikilink">Patrick</a> and <a href="Smythe_Division" title="wikilink">Smythe</a> divisions, and the <a href="Prince_of_Wales_Conference" title="wikilink">Prince of Wales Conference</a>, consisting of the <a href="Adams_Division" title="wikilink">Adams</a> and <a href="Norris_Division" title="wikilink">Norris</a> divisions. The playoffs were expanded to 12 teams, and each division winner was granted a bye in the first round of the playoffs.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The addition of the four WHA teams in 1979 saw the playoffs expanded to 16 teams.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Finally, in 1981, the league realigned all teams by geography. Eastern teams played in the Adams and Patrick divisions of the Wales Conference, and Western teams played in the Norris and Smythe divisions of the Campbell Conference. In addition, the playoff format was changed to have the top four teams in each division qualify rather than the top 16 teams overall. The first two playoff rounds were played entirely within each division. This format lasted until 1993.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="entry-draft">Entry Draft</h3>
<p>During the late 1960s, the concept of sponsoring junior players and teams had been dismantled, meaning that for the <a href="1969_NHL_Amateur_Draft" title="wikilink">1969 NHL Amateur Draft</a>, every player aged 20 or above was eligible to be selected. The Montreal Canadiens, however, exercised a special &quot;cultural option&quot; that allowed them to select two players of French-Canadian heritage, before any other players were selected. These players counted as Montreal's first two choices. After the Canadiens took <a href="R&lt;U+00E9&gt;jean_Houle" title="wikilink">Rejean Houle</a> and <a href="Marc_Tardif" title="wikilink">Marc Tardif</a>, the rest of the league voted to end the rule in 1970, just before future star <a href="Gilbert_Perreault" title="wikilink">Gilbert Perreault</a> was selected first in the <a href="1970_NHL_Expansion_Draft" title="wikilink">1970 expansion draft</a> by the <a href="Buffalo_Sabres" title="wikilink">Buffalo Sabres</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1974, Sabres general manager <a href="Punch_Imlach" title="wikilink">Punch Imlach</a> decided to play a joke on the league during the draft. He selected <a href="Taro_Tsujimoto" title="wikilink">Taro Tsujimoto</a> of the &quot;Tokyo Katanas&quot; with his 11th round pick. Other teams were shocked that the Sabres had scouted for players in Japan, and the league made the pick official. Weeks later, Imlach admitted that he made the player up, choosing the name out of a phone book.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>The league reformatted the Amateur Draft into the NHL Entry Draft in 1979 and simultaneously lowered the draft age to 19.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> It was first opened to the public in 1980, when 2,500 fans attended the draft in the <a href="Montreal_Forum" title="wikilink">Montreal Forum</a>.
