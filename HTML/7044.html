The <a href="ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau" class="uri" title="wikilink">ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau</a> is located in <a href="Maisons-Laffitte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maisons-Laffitte</a>, a northwestern suburb of <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, in the <a href="Departments_of_France" title="wikilink">department</a> of <a href="Yvelines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yvelines</a>, <a href="&lt;U+00CE&gt;le-de-France" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00CE&gt;le-de-France</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The family of Longueil, long associated with the <em><a href="Parlement_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Parlement de Paris</a></em>, had been in possession of part of the seigneurie of Maisons since 1460, and a full share since 1602. Beginning in 1630, and for the next decades, <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Longueil" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Longueil</a>, first president of the <em><a href="Cour_des_aides" title="wikilink">Cour des aides</a></em> and then <em>pr&lt;U+00E9&gt;sident &lt;U+00E0&gt; mortier</em> to the Parlement de Paris, devoted the fortune inherited by his wife, Madeleine Boulenc de Cr&lt;U+00E9&gt;vec&lt;U+0153&gt;ur (who died in 1636), to the construction of a magnificent <a href="ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau" class="uri" title="wikilink">ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau</a>. By 1649 he was able to spend the summer months in his new house, but works on the outbuildings continued after that date. <a href="Louis_XIV_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XIV</a> visited Maisons in April 1651.</p>
<p>The attribution to Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Mansart was common knowledge among contemporaries. <a href="Charles_Perrault" title="wikilink">Charles Perrault</a> reported its reputation: &quot;The ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau of Maisons, of which he [Mansart] had made all the buildings and all the gardens, is of such a singular beauty that there is not a curious foreigner who does not go there to see it, as one of the finest things that we have in France.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nevertheless, the sole surviving document mentioning Mansart's name is a payment of 20,000 <em>livres</em> from Longueil in 1657, apparently occasioned by the final completion of the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau. A pamphlet with the title <em>La Mansarade</em> accuses the architect of having realised, after completing the construction of the first floor, that he had committed an error in the plans and razed everything built so far in order to commence anew.</p>
<p>Perrault emphasizes that the architect had the habit of remodeling certain parts of his buildings more than once, in a search for perfection. This may explain the extraordinary length of time the construction required.</p>
<p>At the death of Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Longueil, in 1677, the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau passed to his heirs until 1732, and then in succession to the marquise de Bellefori&lt;U+00E8&gt;re, then to the marquis de Soy&lt;U+00E9&gt;court. In 1777 it became the property of <a href="Louis_XVI_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XVI</a>'s brother the <a href="Charles_X_of_France" title="wikilink">comte d'Artois</a>, who carried out important interior transformations under the direction of his house architect <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Joseph_B&lt;U+00E9&gt;langer" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Joseph B&lt;U+00E9&gt;langer</a>. These works were interrupted in 1782 for lack of funds. Maisons ceased to be kept up.</p>
<p>Confiscated during the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">Revolution</a> as &quot;national goods&quot;, the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau was sold in 1798 to an army provisioner, M. Lauch&lt;U+00E8&gt;re, again in 1804 to mar&lt;U+00E9&gt;chal <a href="Jean_Lannes" title="wikilink">Jean Lannes</a>, and finally in 1818, to the Parisian banker Jacques Lafitte. Starting in 1834, Lafitte proceeded to develop the surrounding park as building lots; he tore down the fine stables to furnish construction materials for the purchasers. After his daughter the princesse de la Moskowa sold the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau in 1850, it passed to M. Thomas de Colmar, and to the painter Tilman Gromm&lt;U+00E9&gt;, who farmed out the small park and demolished the entrance gateway to the forecourt, enclosing the severely reduced space with a wrought iron grille brought from the Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau de Mailly in Picardy.</p>
<p>In 1905, the State purchased the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau to save it from demolition. It was classed a <em>monument historique</em> in 1914.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau de Maisons was built between the <a href="Seine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seine</a> and the forest of <a href="Saint-Germain-en-Laye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, with its garden front oriented to the southeast. Originally it comprised the garden, a small park of 33 hectares and a large outer park of 300 hectares. The visitor arrived by one of two <a href="Avenue_(landscape)" title="wikilink">avenues</a> that crossed in a T intersection before the gate to the <em><a href="cour_d&#39;honneur" title="wikilink">cour d'honneur</a></em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The principal central axis led to the forest, the cross axis through the village to the southwest and to the river, thence on to Paris. Three gateways stood at the far ends of the avenues.</p>
<p>On one side and the other of the <em>avant-cour</em>, Mansart constructed the stables, masterworks of architecture whose monumental character gave a preview of those that would be built at Versailles and Chantilly. Of these works there exists only a <a href="grotto" class="uri" title="wikilink">grotto</a>, that served also to water the horses.</p>
<p>The ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau itself stood on a rectangular platform outlined in the French manner with a dry moat. The <em>cour d'honneur</em> was defined by terraces. The central block extends symmetrically into short wings, composed of several sections, each with its own roofline, with raked roofs and tall chimney stacks, in several ranges, with a broken fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade reminiscent of the planning in work of <a href="Pierre_Lescot" title="wikilink">Pierre Lescot</a> and <a href="Philibert_Delorme" title="wikilink">Philibert Delorme</a> in the preceding century. The single pile construction typical of its epoch carries three storeys, a basement supporting a ground floor and <em><a href="piano_nobile" title="wikilink">piano nobile</a></em> with three attic floors above.</p>
<h2 id="interiors">Interiors</h2>
<p>The grand central entrance vestibule of stone was originally enclosed by exceptionally fine wrought iron grilles, which are today at the <a href="Louvre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvre</a>. Large bas-reliefs of The Seasons were executed by <a href="Gilles_Gu&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin" title="wikilink">Gilles Gu&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin</a> after drawings provided by <a href="Jacques_Sarazin" title="wikilink">Jacques Sarazin</a>, who oversaw all the sculpture provided for Maisons. There are <a href="lunette" title="wikilink">lunettes</a> representing The Elements, for which Sarazin's drawings also survive.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This vestibule gives onto two state apartments. The apartment on the left, called the <em>Appartement des Captifs</em> was that of Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Longueuil; it has retained its original decor. The chimneypiece of the corner room, the <em>chambre de parade</em> represents a bas-relief medallion of <a href="Louis_XIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XIII</a> supported by captives and a frieze of the triumph of Louis XIII, works of <a href="Gilles_Gu&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin" title="wikilink">Gilles Gu&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin</a> that have given a name to the suite of rooms.</p>
<p>The apartment on the right, called the <em>Appartement de la Renomm&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> was entirely redecorated by B&lt;U+00E9&gt;langer for the comte d'Artois in a discreet <a href="Neoclassicism" title="wikilink">neoclassical style</a> quite in keeping with the general classic style of the ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau.</p>
<p>The staircase was of a type that Mansart originated at Balleroy,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> in which the central space is left open, so that the flights climb the four walls.</p>
<p>On the parade floor, the apartment to the right, called the <em>Appartement des Aigles</em> for the <a href="Empire_style" title="wikilink">Empire style</a> decoration effected by mar&lt;U+00E9&gt;chal Lannes in expectation of the visit of <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>, is undistinguished. That on the left, on the other hand, the <em>Appartement du Roi</em> is also called <em>&lt;U+00E0&gt; l'italienne</em> in that it is covered in false vaulting. The apartment consists of a vast <em>Salle des F&lt;U+00EA&gt;tes</em> employed also in the character of a guardroom, with a tribune for musicians. It opens into the <em>Salon d'Hercule</em> from the painting of <em>Hercules defeating the Hydra</em> that formerly was featured on the <a href="chimneybreast" class="uri" title="wikilink">chimneybreast</a>, with sculptures by Gu&lt;U+00E9&gt;rin. In the end pavilion is a <a href="dome" title="wikilink">domed</a> room articulated by therm figures, a precursor to the grand salon of <a href="Vaux-le-Vicomte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaux-le-Vicomte</a>. A small oval <em>cabinet</em>, or private withdrawing room, the <em>Cabinet des Miroirs</em> bears a refined decor, and a <a href="parquet" class="uri" title="wikilink">parquet</a> floor inlaid with pewter and bone.</p>
