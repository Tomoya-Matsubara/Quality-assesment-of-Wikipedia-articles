<p><strong>Walter John</strong> &quot;<strong>Wally</strong>&quot; <strong>Downes</strong> (born 9 June 1961) is an <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> former <a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a> player and manager. He is also a currently a first team coach at <a href="Southampton_F.C." title="wikilink">Southampton</a>.</p>
<p>He is related to the boxer <a href="Terry_Downes" title="wikilink">Terry Downes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="playing-career">Playing career</h2>
<p>Downes started out as an apprentice with <a href="Wimbledon_F.C." title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a> and was one of the instigators of the <em><a href="Crazy_Gang" title="wikilink">Crazy Gang</a></em> spirit at the club as it rose from the <a href="Football_League_Fourth_Division" title="wikilink">Fourth</a> to the <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a> inside a decade. He made over 200 league appearances for Wimbledon.</p>

<h3 id="crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</h3>
<p>Forced to retire through injury, Downes took a coaching position at <a href="Crystal_Palace_F.C." title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a>, and spent 12 years at <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="wikilink">Selhurst Park</a>, most of these under <a href="Steve_Coppell" title="wikilink">Steve Coppell</a>.</p>
<h3 id="brentford">Brentford</h3>
<p>Downes left Palace in 2000, following Coppell (who had left Palace following a takeover) to <a href="Brentford_F.C." title="wikilink">Brentford</a>, where he became assistant manager. When Coppell left Brentford in June 2002, Downes was appointed manager. He led the club to a mid-table finish in the <a href="Football_League_Second_Division" title="wikilink">Second Division</a> in <a href="2002-03_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2002-03</a>, but was sacked in March 2004 with the club near the bottom of the table and facing <a href="relegation" class="uri" title="wikilink">relegation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Downes then once again rejoined Coppell, this time at <a href="Reading_F.C." title="wikilink">Reading</a>, initially on a casual basis, but quickly proved himself invaluable, and took on the job of coaching Reading's defence. As a result, Downes was a major reason for Reading's impressive defensive display in the <a href="2005-06_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2005-06</a> <a href="Football_League_Championship" title="wikilink">Championship</a> season, where Reading had the best defensive statistics in the entire <a href="English_football_league_system" title="wikilink">English football pyramid</a>, and were promoted to the <a href="FA_Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a> with a record 106 points.</p>
<p>In January 2007, Downes was involved in a touchline scuffle with <a href="Sheffield_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield United</a> manager <a href="Neil_Warnock" title="wikilink">Neil Warnock</a> after he accused Warnock of telling his players to 'break legs'. However Warnock said: <em>&quot;I made the kicking gesture to tell the referee that <a href="Steve_Sidwell" title="wikilink">Steve Sidwell</a>'s tackle on <a href="Chris_Armstrong_(footballer_born_1982)" title="wikilink">Chris Armstrong</a> had been the worst of the game. Fortunately for me, the referee heard exactly what was said and confirmed that.&quot;</em> Downes has been charged with improper conduct for his role in the affray.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6283363.stm">1</a> The incident inspired Reading fans to start a chant for the enigmatic coach, saying &quot;Wally Downes is magic, he wears his magic hat, and when he saw Neil Warnock he punched that f**king tw*t!&quot;. This chant has become popular for the fans of the Berkshire-based club whenever they play teams managed by the unpopular Warnock, particularily due to his teams negative physical method of play.</p>
<p>On 14 May 2009, the club announced that they wouldn't renew his and <a href="Kevin_Dillon_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Kevin Dillon's</a> contract after Reading failed to bounce back to the Premier League at the first attempt after getting knocked out of the Play Offs by <a href="Burnley_F.C." title="wikilink">Burnley</a> 3-0 on aggregate and the departure of Steve Coppell. This was officially announced on the day of Steve Coppell's Press Conference and was first seen in an article in the <a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a> saying he has been &quot;sacked&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="southampton">Southampton</h3>
<p>On 7 September 2009, Downes was appointed to a position within the backroom staff of <a href="League_1" title="wikilink">League 1</a> club, <a href="Southampton_F.C." title="wikilink">Southampton</a>.</p>
