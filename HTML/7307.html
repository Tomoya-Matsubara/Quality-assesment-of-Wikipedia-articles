<p><strong>James Raynor</strong>, usually referred to as <strong>Jim</strong>, is one of the central <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">characters</a> in the fictional <em><a href="StarCraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">StarCraft</a></em> universe. He is a twenty-nine year old<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Terran_(StarCraft)" title="wikilink">Terran</a>, originally from the colony of <a href="Mar_Sara" title="wikilink">Mar Sara</a>. In both <em>StarCraft</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and its expansion <em><a href="StarCraft:_Brood_War" title="wikilink">Brood War</a></em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, Raynor is voiced by Robert Clotworthy. Raynor normally appears in-game on a vulture scavenger bike, although he has also appeared in-game as a <a href="Space_marine" title="wikilink">marine</a> unit and as the commander of the <a href="Space_battleships_and_battlecruisers" title="wikilink">battlecruiser</a> <em>Hyperion</em>. As one of the main characters of <em>StarCraft</em>, he has been <a href="#Critical_reception" title="wikilink">described and praised</a> by several gaming sources.</p>
<h2 id="development-and-character">Development and character</h2>
<p>A character created by <a href="Chris_Metzen" title="wikilink">Chris Metzen</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and James Phinney<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, Jim Raynor was the first video game character Robert Clotworthy voice acted.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Clotworthy decided to voice Raynor without raising his voice much, as Raynor is a &quot;badass&quot; who does not need to raise his voice:<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> if people do not listen to him, it was their own fault. He based this on concept art of Raynor showing him on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, which gave him the impression Raynor was someone people &quot;wouldn't mess with&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He also mentions that Raynor is willing to do the right thing, no matter how difficult it may be, such as his assertion to kill <a href="Sarah_Kerrigan" title="wikilink">Sarah Kerrigan</a> despite his former love for her. Such sacrifices make Raynor a hero of the truest sort in Clotworthy's eyes. In the event that a <em>StarCraft</em> movie was produced, Clotworthy believes <a href="Clive_Owen" title="wikilink">Clive Owen</a> would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him &quot;being dangerous&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>StarCraft II</em>, Raynor's character is based on a character of the same name in the film <em><a href="Rush_(1991_film)" title="wikilink">Rush</a></em>, who Chris Metzen describes as a &quot;gritty, undercover cop&quot;. Metzen also explains that the fact that Raynor, an ordinary man, has personally met and worked with the most influential characters in the games, makes him a personal favorite character of his. Metzen has explained that the years of media attacks from Arcturus Mengsk in the time before <em>StarCraft II</em> has made Raynor jaded and bitter, to the point where &quot;he's still trying, but he's a little lost&quot;. Metzen has confirmed that the game will turn Raynor into a &quot;true&quot; hero.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="starcraft"><em>StarCraft</em></h3>
<p>During the initial Terran campaign of <em>StarCraft</em>, Raynor is a <a href="Terran_Confederacy" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> marshal on Mar Sara.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The early missions center on his attempts to protect the colony from the <a href="Zerg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zerg</a>, but he is quickly arrested for doing so.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> During his time in prison, the player's character - the magistrate in governing the colony - makes a deal with the <a href="Terran_Dominion" title="wikilink">Sons of Korhal</a> for evacuation in order to escape the Zerg infestation. <a href="Arcturus_Mengsk" title="wikilink">Arcturus Mengsk</a> has his men rescue Raynor from the prison for political reasons.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Later in Episode I, Raynor accompanies the Sons of Korhal to <a href="Antiga_Prime" title="wikilink">Antiga Prime</a>, where he assists in helping the colony rebel and reluctantly participates in ensuring <a href="Edmund_Duke" title="wikilink">Edmund Duke</a>'s defection.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> During this time, Raynor becomes infatuated with Mengsk's second-in-command, <a href="Sarah_Kerrigan" title="wikilink">Sarah Kerrigan</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Towards the end of Episode I, the Sons of Korhal attack the Confederate capital world <a href="Tarsonis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tarsonis</a>, and Mengsk abandons Kerrigan to die at the hands of the Zerg. As a result, in the final mission of Episode I, Raynor defects and leaves Tarsonis with men still loyal to him,.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The group is eventually labeled <em><a href="Raynor&#39;s_raiders" title="wikilink">Raynor's raiders</a></em>, and in their second act against Mengsk they steal his capital ship <em>Hyperion</em>, which serves as their mobile base of operations.</p>
<p>Instead of being killed, Kerrigan is captured by the Zerg and taken to <a href="Char_(StarCraft)" title="wikilink">Char</a>. In Episode II, Kerrigan calls out to Raynor for help via telepathic dreams, but by the time he arrives she has been fully <a href="Infested_Terran" title="wikilink">infested</a> by the Zerg. She destroys Raynor's base camp, but allows him and his men to leave.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, the rebels are stranded on the planet with the High Templar <a href="Tassadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tassadar</a> and the Dark Templar <a href="Zeratul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeratul</a>. In the middle of Episode III, a Protoss force under command of the player rescues Raynor and Tassadar from an orbital platform. Raynor and his remaining forces return to Aiur with a fleet loyal to Tassadar and take part in the final mission of the game against the <a href="Zerg_Overmind" title="wikilink">Zerg Overmind</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="Easy_Rider_(StarCraft).jpg" title="fig:Chris Metzen&#39;s &quot;Easy Rider&quot; concept art, from which Clotworthy based the personality of Raynor." alt="Chris Metzen&#39;s &quot;Easy Rider&quot; concept art, from which Clotworthy based the personality of Raynor." width="200" /></p>
<h3 id="starcraft-brood-war"><em>StarCraft: Brood War</em></h3>
<p>Although Raynor makes only sporadic appearances in <em>Brood War</em>, he still has a major role in the progression of the story. In the Protoss campaign, Raynor remains on <a href="Aiur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aiur</a> with <a href="Fenix_(StarCraft)" title="wikilink">Fenix</a> to assist the evacuation to <a href="Shakuras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakuras</a>, later locking down the <a href="Psionic_technology_(StarCraft)#Warp_technology" title="wikilink">warp gate</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> to prevent Zerg pursuit. During this time, the two become good friends despite being different species. In Episode V, they are contacted by Kerrigan, who convinces them that the <a href="United_Earth_Directorate" title="wikilink">United Earth Directorate</a> is a <a href="lesser_of_two_evils_principle" title="wikilink">greater threat than her</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> As a result, Raynor and Fenix kidnap Mengsk from right under the UED's fleet,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and the allied forces led by Kerrigan recapture <a href="Korhal" title="wikilink">Korhal IV</a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> in Episode VI. Afterward, Kerrigan betrays the group by killing Raynor's friend Fenix.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In his final <em>Brood War</em> appearance, an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.</p>
<h3 id="starcraft-ii"><em>StarCraft II</em></h3>
<p>Raynor and his raiders will be the focus of the Terran campaign in <em><a href="StarCraft_II" title="wikilink">StarCraft II</a></em>. The <em>Hyperion</em> crew is overworked and underpaid, and is considering a mutiny. In the single-player demo shown at Blizzcon in August 2007, Raynor and his second-in-command Matt Horner steal unknown artifacts from a Protoss base camp in the hopes a group called the Moebius Foundation will pay well for them.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In the demo, Raynor's voice was not that of Clotworthy; Blizzard has since explained that Clotworthy is willing to return, and they understand the fan connection to his work, but they also enjoy the new voice actor they've found, and the final decision has not been made yet.</p>
<h3 id="other-appearances">Other appearances</h3>
<p>Raynor participates in a secret mission exclusive to <em>StarCraft's</em> <a href="Nintendo_64" title="wikilink">Nintendo 64</a> version<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>. <a href="Artanis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artanis</a> sends Raynor with Taldarin,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> a veteran Protoss dragoon, to <a href="Braxis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braxis</a> to rescue and deinfest the resurrected <a href="Alexei_Stukov" title="wikilink">Alexei Stukov</a>. With the assistance of Stukov's former Terran allies, Stukov's humanity is restored and he leaves the planet with Raynor.</p>
<p>Several <em>StarCraft</em> novels also feature Raynor; he is a prominent character in <em><a href="StarCraft:_Liberty&#39;s_Crusade" title="wikilink">StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade</a></em>, which reveals that Raynor had a wife and son.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His son is conscripted for the Confederate <a href="Psionic_technology_(StarCraft)#Ghost_agents" title="wikilink">ghost program</a>, and the intense training kills him. Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies after a period of depression and illness.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in <em><a href="StarCraft:_Queen_of_Blades" title="wikilink">StarCraft: Queen of Blades</a></em>, a novelization of the events of <em>StarCraft</em> Episode II.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The tactical shooter <em><a href="StarCraft:_Ghost" title="wikilink">StarCraft: Ghost</a></em> was to feature Raynor, as Clotworthy was brought in to voice the character;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> however, the game has been postponed indefinitely, and Raynor's role has never been revealed. Also, Bill Roper, Blizzard North's vice president, stated that the game would not center on Kerrigan or Raynor.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>
<p>Raynor's critical reaction has been generally positive. Gaming's Edge.com describes Raynor as &quot;almost the prototypical action movie figure who does things his own way and to hell with the rest of the world&quot;,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and says that he has a &quot;healthy dose of arrogance&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The article draws note to the fact that despite being a moral man, Raynor's attempts to do the right thing almost always end with him getting the poor end of the deal due to circumstances beyond his control. Gaming's Edge also brings attention to the similarities between <a href="Tassadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tassadar</a> and Raynor, often displayed through their friendship in-game,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> in that both have little interest in politics and formalities and prefer to act for the greater good. A <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> reader's poll for Gamespot voted Raynor one of computer gamings top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater Marshall to galactic hero. Additional praise was also given to the quality of Clotworthy's voice acting.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, other reviewers have praised the <em>StarCraft</em> characters as a whole; for instance, Gamespot states that the voice acting &quot;brings the characters to life&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
