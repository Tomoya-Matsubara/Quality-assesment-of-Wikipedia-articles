<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The commercial towing spaceship <em>Nostromo</em> is on a return trip from Thedus to <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a>, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral <a href="ore" class="uri" title="wikilink">ore</a> and carrying its seven-member crew in <a href="stasis_(fiction)" title="wikilink">stasis</a>. Upon receiving a mysterious transmission from a nearby <a href="asteroid" title="wikilink">planetoid</a>, the ship's <a href="computer" class="uri" title="wikilink">computer</a> awakens the crew.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Acting on orders from their corporate employers, the crew lands the <em>Nostromo</em> on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. <a href="Captain_(Land)" title="wikilink">Captain</a> Dallas (<a href="Tom_Skerritt" title="wikilink">Tom Skerritt</a>), <a href="Executive_Officer" title="wikilink">Executive Officer</a> Kane (<a href="John_Hurt" title="wikilink">John Hurt</a>), and <a href="Navigator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Navigator</a> Lambert (<a href="Veronica_Cartwright" title="wikilink">Veronica Cartwright</a>) set out to investigate the signal's source while <a href="Warrant_Officer" title="wikilink">Warrant Officer</a> <a href="Ellen_Ripley" title="wikilink">Ripley</a> (<a href="Sigourney_Weaver" title="wikilink">Sigourney Weaver</a>), Science Officer Ash (<a href="Ian_Holm" title="wikilink">Ian Holm</a>), and <a href="Engineer" title="wikilink">Engineers</a> Brett (<a href="Harry_Dean_Stanton" title="wikilink">Harry Dean Stanton</a>) and Parker (<a href="Yaphet_Kotto" title="wikilink">Yaphet Kotto</a>) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.</p>
<p>Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a mysterious derelict <a href="fictional_extraterrestrials" title="wikilink">alien</a> spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been bent outward from the inside. Ripley, meanwhile, determines that the mysterious signal is some type of warning. Kane discovers a chamber containing numerous strange <a href="egg_(biology)" title="wikilink">eggs</a>, one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the <em>Nostromo</em>, where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's <a href="quarantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarantine</a> protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is a powerful <a href="acid" class="uri" title="wikilink">acid</a>. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resumes their trip back to Earth.</p>
<p>Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, <a href="taser" title="wikilink">tasers</a>, and <a href="flamethrower" title="wikilink">flamethrowers</a>. Brett follows Jones, the crew's cat, into a large room where the now-fully-grown <a href="Alien_(Alien_franchise)" title="wikilink">Alien</a> attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into the <a href="airlock" class="uri" title="wikilink">airlock</a>, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people.</p>
<p>Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the <em>Nostromo</em>'s corporate employers even at the expense of the crew. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and knocks his head off with a <a href="fire_extinguisher" title="wikilink">fire extinguisher</a>, revealing Ash to be an <a href="android" class="uri" title="wikilink">android</a>. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the <em>Nostromo</em>'s self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley arms the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with Jones, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and escapes in the shuttle as the <em>Nostromo</em> explodes.</p>
<p>As she prepares to enter stasis Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a <a href="space_suit" title="wikilink">space suit</a> and opens the hatch, causing <a href="explosive_decompression" title="wikilink">explosive decompression</a> which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a <a href="grappling_gun" title="wikilink">grappling gun</a> which pushes it out, but the gun is caught in the closing door and the Alien is tethered to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. The film ends with Ripley and Jones entering stasis for the return trip to Earth.</p>

They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Bannon soon accepted an offer to work on a film adaptation of <em><a href="Dune_(novel)" title="wikilink">Dune</a></em>, a project which took him to <a href="Paris,_France" title="wikilink">Paris, France</a> for six months.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose works gave him ideas for his science fiction story including <a href="Chris_Foss" title="wikilink">Chris Foss</a>, <a href="H.R._Giger" title="wikilink">H.R. Giger</a>, and <a href="Jean_Giraud" title="wikilink">Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> O'Bannon was impressed by Foss' covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work &quot;disturbing&quot;:<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> &quot;His paintings had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> After the <em>Dune</em> project collapsed O'Bannon returned to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> to live with Shusett and the two revived his <em>Memory</em> script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about <a href="gremlin" title="wikilink">gremlins</a> infiltrating a <a href="B-17_Flying_Fortress" title="wikilink">B-17 bomber</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <a href="working_title" title="wikilink">working title</a> of the project was now <em>Star Beast</em>, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to <em>Alien</em> after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the story. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as a <a href="noun" class="uri" title="wikilink">noun</a> and <a href="adjective" class="uri" title="wikilink">adjective</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would later burst out of him, feeling that this was an interesting <a href="plot_device" title="wikilink">plot device</a> by which the alien creature could get onboard the ship.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In writing the script O'Bannon drew inspiration from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He has stated that &quot;I didn't steal <em>Alien</em> from anybody. I stole it from <em>everybody</em>!&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Thing_from_Another_World" title="wikilink">The Thing from Another World</a></em> (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <em><a href="Forbidden_Planet" title="wikilink">Forbidden Planet</a></em> (1956) gave O'Bannon the idea of a ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <em><a href="Planet_of_the_Vampires" title="wikilink">Planet of the Vampires</a></em> (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien <a href="skeleton" class="uri" title="wikilink">skeleton</a>; this influenced the <em>Nostromo</em> crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> O'Bannon has also noted the influence of &quot;Junkyard&quot;, a short story by <a href="Clifford_D._Simak" title="wikilink">Clifford D. Simak</a> in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He has also cited as influences <em>Strange Relations</em> by <a href="Philip_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Farmer" title="wikilink">Philip Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Farmer</a> (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and <a href="EC_Comics" title="wikilink">EC Comics</a> horror titles such as <em><a href="Weird_Tales" title="wikilink">Weird Tales</a></em> which carried stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>With roughly eighty-five percent of the plot completed, Shusett and O'Bannon presented their initial script to several studios,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> pitching it as &quot;<em><a href="Jaws_(film)" title="wikilink">Jaws</a></em> in space.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> They were on the verge of signing a deal with <a href="Roger_Corman" title="wikilink">Roger Corman</a>'s studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to <a href="Walter_Hill_(director)" title="wikilink">Walter Hill</a>, <a href="David_Giler" title="wikilink">David Giler</a>, and Gordon Carroll, who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and revisions to it.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience with science fiction and according to Shusett: &quot;They weren't good at making it better, or in fact at not making it even worse.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> O'Bannon believed that they were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming it as their own.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the <a href="android" class="uri" title="wikilink">android</a> character Ash which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> but which Shusett describes as &quot;one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In total Hill and Giler went through eight different drafts of the script, mostly concentrating on the Ash subplot but also making the dialogue more naturalistic and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the multiple rewrites, 20th Century Fox did not express confidence in financing a science fiction film. However, after the success of <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: &quot;When <em>Star Wars</em> came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became the hot genre.&quot; O'Bannon recalls that &quot;They wanted to follow through on <em>Star Wars</em>, and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their desk was <em>Alien</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <em>Alien</em> was <a href="greenlight" title="wikilink">greenlit</a> by 20th Century Fox at an initial budget of $4.2 million.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<li><strong><a href="Tom_Skerritt" title="wikilink">Tom Skerritt</a></strong> as <strong>Dallas</strong>, the Captain of the <em>Nostromo</em>.

<p><a href="Film_criticism" title="wikilink">Film critic</a> <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> has noted that the actors in <em>Alien</em> were older than was typical in thriller films at the time, and that this helped make the characters more convincing: </p>

<p>The sets of the <em>Nostromo</em>'s three decks were each created almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a separate stage and the various rooms connected via corridors.

He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the budget in order to film the scene over several extra days.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then make the final log entry in her voice, but the producers vetoed this idea as they believed that the Alien had to die at the end of the film.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

Three models of the <em>Nostromo</em> were made: a twelve-inch version for medium and long shots, a four-foot version for rear shots, and a twelve-foot, seven-ton rig for the undocking and planetoid surface sequences.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams.

<p>A separate model, approximately forty feet long, was created for the <em>Nostromo</em>'s underside from which the <em>Narcissus</em> would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene.

And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak.

Fox approached Ridley Scott to digitally restore and <a href="remaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">remaster</a> the original <em>Alien</em>, and to restore several scenes which had been cut during the editing process for inclusion in an expanded version of the film.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> Upon viewing the expanded version, Scott felt that it was too long and chose to recut it into a more streamlined alternate version:<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a>  The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; restored roughly four minutes of deleted footage while cutting about five minutes of other material, leaving it actually about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the <em>Nostromo</em>.

Each film was also released singly as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of <em>Alien</em>, saying that &quot;For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of <em>Alien</em> was perfect.

<h3 id="imitations">Imitations</h3>
<p><em>Alien</em> had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut <a href="Dan_O&#39;Bannon" title="wikilink">Dan O'Bannon</a> was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled <em>Black Space</em>. However, O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his <em>Alien</em> script first.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a> In the wake of <em>Alien</em>'s success a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by copying its title. One of the first was <em>The Alien Dead</em> (1979), which was titled at the last minute to cash in on <em>Alien</em>'s popularity.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> <em><a href="Contamination_(film)" title="wikilink">Contamination</a></em> (1980) was initially going to be titled <em>Alien 2</em> until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director <a href="Luigi_Cozzi" title="wikilink">Luigi Cozzi</a> and made him change it, and it built on press coverage of <em>Alien</em>'s chestburster scene by having many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> An unauthorized Italian sequel to <em>Alien</em>, titled <em><a href="Alien_2" title="wikilink">Alien 2</a></em>, was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate inside human hosts. Other science fiction films of the time that exploited elements of <em>Alien</em> included <em><a href="Inseminoid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inseminoid</a></em> (1981) and <em><a href="Xtro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xtro</a></em> (1982).<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a> <em>Alien</em>'s influence also extended into <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video games</a>, as the development team working on <em><a href="Metroid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metroid</a></em> (1986) acknowledged that they were inspired by the film's atmosphere and elements of science fiction adventure, and named the <a href="boss_(video_game)" title="wikilink">boss character</a> Ridley after Ridley Scott.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a><a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a></p>

<p>In the decades since its original release critics have analyzed and acknowledged <em>Alien</em>'s roots in earlier works of fiction.

<h3 id="lasting-critical-praise">Lasting critical praise</h3>
<p><em>Alien</em> has continued to receive critical praise over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> It has a 97% approval rating at the online <a href="review_aggregator" title="wikilink">review aggregator</a> <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 71 reviews,<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a> while <a href="Metacritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacritic</a> gives the Director's Cut an 83% approval rating based on 22 reviews.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> Critical interest in the film was re-ignited in part by the theatrical release the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; in 2003. In his &quot;Great Movies&quot; column that year, critic <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> ranked it among &quot;the most influential of modern action pictures&quot;, praising its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:</p>

<p>McIntee praises <em>Alien</em> as &quot;possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with [science fiction] trappings.&quot;<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> He notes, however, that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. <em>Alien</em>, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: &quot;It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.&quot;<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> Along with <em>Halloween</em> and <em><a href="Friday_the_13th_(1980_film)" title="wikilink">Friday the 13th</a></em> (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the <a href="slasher_film" title="wikilink">slasher film</a> genre: &quot;The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.&quot;<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a> He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: &quot;Fans of <a href="Alfred_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Hitchcockian</a> thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. [Science fiction] fans love the hard [science fiction] trappings and hardware.

<li id="fn9">In the script and film the computer is referred to by the crew members as &quot;Mother&quot;. An October 1979 issue of <em><a href="Fantastic_Films" title="wikilink">Fantastic Films</a></em> magazine, as well as the back of the 1980 Fox videodisk of the film, explain that &quot;Mother&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;MU/TH/UR 6000&quot;, the model of the computer. The chapter list for <em>Alien</em> in the 2003 <em>Alien Quadrilogy</em> <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> set also lists it as &quot;MU/TH/UR&quot;. The 1997 sequel <em><a href="Alien_Resurrection" title="wikilink">Alien Resurrection</a></em>, the fourth film in the series, echoed this element by having the crew of the <em>Auriga</em> refer to the ship's onboard computer as &quot;Father.&quot; McIntee, 25, 119.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
