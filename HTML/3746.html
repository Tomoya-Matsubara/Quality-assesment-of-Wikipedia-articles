<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Rudolf Schottlaender studied philosophy with <a href="Edmund_Husserl" title="wikilink">Edmund Husserl</a>, <a href="Martin_Heidegger" title="wikilink">Martin Heidegger</a> and <a href="Nicolai_Hartmann" title="wikilink">Nicolai Hartmann</a> in <a href="Freiburg" title="wikilink">Freiburg im Breisgau</a>. There, he became acquainted with G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther Stern (the later author <a href="G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther_Anders" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther Anders</a>) and married Stern's sister Hilde shortly afterwards (the first of three marriages). Schottlaender also studied with <a href="Karl_Jaspers" title="wikilink">Karl Jaspers</a>. Despite his active interest for <a href="phenomenology" class="uri" title="wikilink">phenomenology</a> as a student, Schottlaender referred more to the <a href="Stoicism" title="wikilink">stoics</a> and to <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Baruch Spinoza</a>, in whose spirit he left Judaism in 1921.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a>, Schottlaender was a private scholar. With his translation of the first part of <em><a href="In_Search_of_Lost_Time" title="wikilink">A la recherche du temps perdu</a></em>, which was published by &quot;Die Schmiede&quot; under the title of <em>Der Weg zu Swann</em>, he was the first German translator of <a href="Marcel_Proust" title="wikilink">Marcel Proust</a>. He survived the <a href="National_Socialism" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> regime and the persecution of the Jews, hiding in Berlin.</p>
<p>After 1945, he taught Latin and Greek as a secondary school teacher in <a href="West_Berlin" title="wikilink">West Berlin</a>. In between (1947-1949), he taught philosophy at the <a href="Dresden_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Dresden University of Technology</a> (<em>Technische Hochschule Dresden</em>), but as a pugnacious <a href="democracy" title="wikilink">democrat</a> and <a href="humanism" title="wikilink">humanist</a>, he came in conflict with the authorities of the <a href="Soviet_occupation_zone" title="wikilink">Soviet occupation zone</a>. As a result, he went back to West Berlin and worked as a secondary school teacher again. There, he became the victim of a <a href="slander" class="uri" title="wikilink">slander</a> campaign because of his efforts concerning overcoming the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a> and got into professional difficulties. In 1959, he was offered a chair as professor for Latin literature, with special consideration of the Greek. (He was unable to teach philosophy there because he was a <a href="Marxism" title="wikilink">non-Marxist</a> and because of his <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a> experiences.) After the building of the <a href="Berlin_Wall" title="wikilink">Berlin Wall</a> in August 1961, he had to move from West Berlin to East Berlin with his family in order to continue this work. He was given emeritus status in 1965.</p>
<p>Besides numerous philological and philosophical works, Schottlaender published brilliant translations (new translations of <a href="Sophocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sophocles</a> which were very effective on the stage, the publication of an edition of <a href="Petrarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrarch</a>, among others) and fundamental discussions of questions concerning Judaism and <a href="antisemitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">antisemitism</a>. In his political <a href="essay" title="wikilink">essays</a> and articles, which he predominantly published in the West, he saw himself as a mediator between the systems. Because of his positions critical to <a href="East_Germany" title="wikilink">East Germany</a>, he was put under close surveillance by the Ministry for State Security (<em>Ministerium f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Staatssicherheit</em> or <a href="Stasi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stasi</a>). He inspired leading minds of the developing opposition in East Germany.</p>
