<p>&quot;<strong>The Statue</strong>&quot; is the sixth episode of the <a href="Seinfeld_(season_2)" title="wikilink">second season</a> of the <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> sitcom <em><a href="Seinfeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seinfeld</a></em>, and the show's eleventh episode overall. In the episode, <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> <a href="Jerry_Seinfeld_(character)" title="wikilink">Jerry Seinfeld</a> (<a href="Jerry_Seinfeld" title="wikilink">Jerry Seinfeld</a>) inherits some old possessions of his grandfather. One of these is a statue, resembling one that his friend <a href="George_Costanza" title="wikilink">George Costanza</a> (<a href="Jason_Alexander" title="wikilink">Jason Alexander</a>) broke when he was ten years old. When Jerry sees the statue in the house of Ray (Michael D. Conway), the man who cleaned his apartment, he believes Ray stole the statue. Jerry struggles to get back at Ray, as his friend <a href="Elaine_Benes" title="wikilink">Elaine Benes</a> (<a href="Julia_Louis-Dreyfus" title="wikilink">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>) is editing the book of Ray's girlfriend.</p>
<p>The episode was written by <a href="Larry_Charles" title="wikilink">Larry Charles</a> and directed by <a href="Tom_Cherones" title="wikilink">Tom Cherones</a>. The character of Jerry's neighbour <a href="Cosmo_Kramer" title="wikilink">Cosmo Kramer</a> (<a href="Michael_Richards" title="wikilink">Michael Richards</a>) developed in this episode, as he goes undercover as a cop to retrieve the statue. Charles was interested in the development of Kramer, as he felt George and Jerry had their counterparts in co-creators <a href="Larry_David" title="wikilink">Larry David</a> and Seinfeld. Richards enjoyed how his character acted in the episode and encouraged Charles to continue exploiting the Kramer character. &quot;The Statue&quot; first aired on NBC on April 11, 1991 in the United States and was watched by over 23 million American homes. It gained mixed responses from critics.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Jerry <a href="inherit" title="wikilink">receives</a> some old possessions of his <a href="grandfather" class="uri" title="wikilink">grandfather</a> Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothing. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed by the quality of the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when he couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t find the statue, Jerry&lt;U+2019&gt;s suspicion is confirmed.</p>
<p>Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer discuss the situation and Kramer urges Jerry to do something about it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears Jerry's opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and steals back the statue. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But when George holds the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pad on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor.</p>
