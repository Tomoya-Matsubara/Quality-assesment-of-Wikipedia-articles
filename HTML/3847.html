<p><strong>Malvern College</strong> is a <a href="coeducational" class="uri" title="wikilink">coeducational</a> <a href="Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">independent school</a> located on a 250 acre (101 ha) campus near the town centre of <a href="Malvern,_Worcestershire" title="wikilink">Malvern</a>, <a href="Worcestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a> in England.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Founded in 1865,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> it was one of the twenty four <a href="Public_school_(UK)" title="wikilink">Public Schools</a> listed in the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889. Until 1992, the College was a <a href="secondary_school" title="wikilink">secondary school</a> for boys aged 13 to 18. Following a series of mergers, with private <a href="primary_school" title="wikilink">primary schools</a> and a girl's school in the area, it has since become coeducational with pupils from 3 to 19 years old.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2008 the school had a total of 600 pupils, of which around 480 were boarders aged 12 - 19.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The school is known for its innovative approaches to education and for sports. Among its alumni are at least two <a href="Prime_Minister" title="wikilink">Prime Ministers</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> two <a href="Nobel_Laureate" title="wikilink">Nobel Laureates</a> and an Olympic Gold medalist. The novelist <a href="C._S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C. S. Lewis</a>, author of <em><a href="The_Chronicles_of_Narnia" title="wikilink">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> was also a former student of the school. It is a member of the <a href="Headmasters&#39;_and_Headmistresses&#39;_Conference" title="wikilink">Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference</a> and of the <a href="Rugby_Group" title="wikilink">Rugby Group</a> of prestigious British independent schools. An Ofsted report following a February 2010 inspection rated the school's boardiing facilities with a Grade 2 (good).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Maincollege.jpg" title="fig:Main College in snow" alt="Main College in snow" /> <img src="Malvern_College_Chapel.jpg" title="fig:The College chapel with the Porter&#39;s Lodge and the Malvern Hills in the background" alt="The College chapel with the Porter&#39;s Lodge and the Malvern Hills in the background" /> Set in the <a href="Malvern_Hills" title="wikilink">Malvern Hills</a>, the school's location owes much to Malvern's emergence in the nineteenth century as a fashionable spa resort, appreciated for its unpolluted air and the healing qualities of its famous <a href="Malvern_water" title="wikilink">spring water</a>.</p>
<p>The school opened its doors for the first time in January 1865. Initially, there were only about twenty four boy pupils, around six teachers and two <a href="boarding_house" title="wikilink">houses</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Expansion was rapid and in 1877, there were 290 boys and six Houses, and by the end of the 1890s the school had around 600 boys in 10 boarding houses.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Further expansion of pupil numbers and buildings continued between the end of the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">Great War</a> in 1918 and the start of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> in 1939.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> the College premises were requisitioned by the <a href="Admiralty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a> between October 1939 and July 1940, when the school was temporarily relocated to <a href="Blenheim_Palace" title="wikilink">Blenheim Palace</a>. In 1942, its premises were again needed for governmental use, on this occasion by the <a href="Telecommunications_Research_Establishment" title="wikilink">TRE</a> and, from May 1942 to July 1946, the school was housed with <a href="Harrow_School" title="wikilink">Harrow School</a>. <a href="QinetiQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">QinetiQ</a>, a private sector successor to the government's original research facility, is still sited on former College land.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Having traditionally been a school for boys aged from 13 to 18 years old, in 1992, it merged with Ellerslie Girls&lt;U+2019&gt; School and Hillstone <a href="Preparatory_school_(UK)" title="wikilink">prep school</a> to become <a href="coeducational" class="uri" title="wikilink">coeducational</a> with pupils from 3 to 18 years old.<sup><a href="http://www.malvern-college.co.uk/prep/welcome.shtml">1</a></sup> In September 2008, the College's Prep School merged with <a href="The_Downs_School_(Herefordshire)" title="wikilink">The Downs</a> prep school on the latter's nearby site in <a href="Colwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colwall</a>, <a href="Herefordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herefordshire</a> to form <em>The Downs, Malvern College Prep School</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The year 2008, also, saw the start of a multi-million pound development scheme<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> that included a new Sports Complex, new athletics and viewing facilities at the pitches and two new Boarding Houses. The Sports Complex and new houses were opened in October 2009 by <a href="Prince_Andrew" title="wikilink">HRH Prince Andrew</a>, the Duke of York. Ellerslie House was opened for girls, commemorating the eponymous former girls' school, and the other new House has become the new permanent residence for the boys of No. 7.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sport">Sport</h2>
<p>The school has a strong sporting tradition. For boy's sports, some Malvernians would consider the College to be best known as a <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a> school although its <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> sides have also produced players who have gone on to play at international level. Traditionally, sport for boys used to be split between the original 'major sports' of football, cricket, and rackets (<a href="rugby_football" title="wikilink">rugby</a> was added later), and 'minor sports'. Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and <a href="lacrosse" class="uri" title="wikilink">lacrosse</a> in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and <a href="rounders" class="uri" title="wikilink">rounders</a> in the summer.</p>
<p>The College also plays a multitude of other sports such as <a href="Rackets_(sport)" title="wikilink">Rackets</a>, <a href="Fives" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fives</a>, Athletics, Tennis, Squash, Croquet, Basketball, Badminton and Polo. Some boy's hockey and girl's football are played.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 16, 2009, a new sports complex and hospitality suite was opened by <a href="Prince_Andrew" title="wikilink">Prince Andrew</a>. The opening was attended by several well known sports personalities including athlete <a href="Dame_Kelly_Holmes" title="wikilink">Dame Kelly Holmes</a>, cricketers <a href="Michael_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Michael Vaughan</a> and <a href="Graham_Gooch" title="wikilink">Graham Gooch</a>, footballer <a href="Peter_Shilton" title="wikilink">Peter Shilton</a>, rugby union player <a href="Jason_Leonard" title="wikilink">Jason Leonard</a>, athlete <a href="Christina_Boxer" title="wikilink">Christina Boxer</a> and hockey player <a href="Rachel_Walker_(field_hockey)" title="wikilink">Rachel Walker</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The indoor sports facilities which have been built on the site of the old swimming pool are also used for training by <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire County Cricket Club</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The facility which offers an 8 court sports hall, a dance studio and fitness suite, a climbing wall, two squash courts, a shooting range, a large function suite, and a 6 lane swimming pool, is also available for use by the wider community.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h2>
<p>While academic success is considered important, emphasis is also placed on the all-round development of the individual rather than on academic results alone.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the Sixth Form, courses are offered at <a href="Advanced_Level_(UK)" title="wikilink">A-Level</a> in art, business studies, classical civilisation, design and technology, drama and theatre studies, economics, English literature, geography, Greek, history, history of art, key skills, Latin, mathematics, modern landuages (French, German, Spanish), music, music technology, physical education, politics and the sciences (biology, chemistry, physics).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Further courses are available at <a href="IB_Diploma_Programme" title="wikilink">International Baccalaureate</a> level,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and special arrangements are sometimes made for other courses upon request.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>A House is a component of the school community and a place where pupils reside and engage in private study. Normally, a pupil remains at his chosen House until he leaves the school. Each house has its own <em>colours</em>. Competitions are regularly arranged between the Houses in a range of academic, artistic and sporting activities. With the exceptions of School House and Ellerslie House, the eleven houses at Malvern are named with numbers 1 to 9, a system which used to be used at <a href="Roedean_School" title="wikilink">Roedean School</a>, a girl's school founded by the sisters of the <a href="List_of_Old_Malvernians" title="wikilink">Old Malvernian</a> judge <a href="Paul_Ogden_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Sir Paul Ogden Lawrence</a>.

</dl>
<p>The main social event of the school calendar Commemoration Day, or &quot;Commem&quot; as it is known in the school, celebrates the founding of the school. A service is held where prizes are awarded. A cricket match then takes place between the 1st cricket XI and the Free Foresters. The inter-house Athletics competition and the Summer Concert take place on the Friday before Commem. It is held on the Saturday of Half-term in the <a href="Summer_term" title="wikilink">Summer term</a>.</p>

</dl>
<p>The School Council organises a charity ball, a <a href="black_tie" title="wikilink">black tie</a> themed event that takes place in the 5th week of every Autumn Term. A similar event called <em>The Autumn Ball</em> is held for the Lower School.</p>
<dl>
<dt>the inter-house Singing Competition</dt>

<dl>
<dt>The Ledder</dt>

</dl>
<p>The Ledder, or Ledbury Run, is a  cross country race that starts in the town of <a href="Ledbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ledbury</a>, goes over the Malvern Hills and finishes on the Senior, the main cricket pitch in the centre of the College. The first 9 runners receive Ledder Caps. In its early days there was no organised route and pupils simply had to get back to college as fast as they could. <img src="Remembrancesunday.jpg" title="fig:St. George and the Quad on Remembrance Sunday" alt="St. George and the Quad on Remembrance Sunday" /></p>
<dl>
<dt>Remembrance Sunday</dt>

</dl>
<p>On the Sunday closest to the 11th of November, known as <a href="Remembrance_Sunday" title="wikilink">Remembrance Sunday</a>, the entire college assembles in front of St. George to await a procession of parents, alumni, guests and teachers. Two minutes silence is followed by <a href="The_Last_Post" title="wikilink">The Last Post</a> and a reading. Representatives of the student body (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy or Girl) and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the <a href="Great_War" title="wikilink">Great War</a>.</p>
