The conference noted the indivisible nature of the Palestinian people, warned against accepting divisions imposed upon them by others, and defined the role of the three networks in working towards a unified Palestinian civil society, including Palestinians living in <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the large Palestinian refugee communities in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Ittijah also attended the <a href="Durban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durban</a> <a href="World_Conference_against_Racism" title="wikilink">World Conference against Racism</a> in 2001.

<p>Ittijah sponsored a 2002 conference &quot;An End to Borders: Arab Civil Society Takes up the Challenge&quot; in partnership with the <a href="Cairo_Institute_for_Human_Rights_Studies" title="wikilink">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a>.

<h2 id="other-activities">Other Activities</h2>
<p>In 2003, Ittijah issued a petition protesting the attempted murder of Arab <a href="Knesset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knesset</a> Member <a href="Issam_Makhoul" title="wikilink">Issam Makhoul</a>. On Friday, 24 October 2003, a bomb was placed under MK Makhoul's car. Ittijah argued that the anonymous attack was the result of public incitement against Arab leaders by the Israeli government. Ittijah asked the government to step back from its attacks that create an uncontrollable atmosphere of violence. Thirty-four Arab non-governmental organizations in Israel were initial signatories to the petition calling for defense of the democratic right of Arab Israelis to take part in Israel's public and political life.</p>
<p>In August 2004, Ittijah achieved Special Consultative status from the Economic and Social Council of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, the first Palestinian NGO within Israel to gain consultative status with a United Nations council.<a href="http://www.ittijah.org/press/pr_04_08_05.html">1</a></p>
