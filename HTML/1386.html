Often, a cloud of <a href="debris" class="uri" title="wikilink">debris</a> encircles the lower portion of the funnel.</p>
<p>Most tornadoes have winds of 110 <a href="miles_per_hour" title="wikilink">mph</a> (175 <a href="kilometres_per_hour" title="wikilink">km/h</a>) or less, are approximately 250 <a href="foot_(unit_of_length)" title="wikilink">feet</a> (75 <a href="metre" title="wikilink">meters</a>) across, and travel a few <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a> (several <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">kilometers</a>) before dissipating. However, some tornadoes can have winds of more than 300 mph (480 km/h), be more than a mile (1.6 km) across, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 kilometers).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Seymour_Texas_Tornado.jpg" title="fig:A tornado near Seymour, Texas." alt="A tornado near Seymour, Texas." width="250" /> A <strong>tornado</strong> is defined by the <em>Glossary of Meteorology</em> as &quot;<em>a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a <a href="cumuliform_cloud" title="wikilink">cumuliform cloud</a> or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud...</em>&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Condensation funnel</dt>

</dl>
<p>A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the fast wind speeds (see <a href="Bernoulli&#39;s_principle" title="wikilink">Bernoulli's principle</a>) and rapid rotation (due to <a href="Balanced_flow" title="wikilink">cyclostrophic</a> balance) usually causes <a href="water_vapor" title="wikilink">water vapor</a> in the air to condense into a visible <strong>condensation funnel</strong>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Strictly, the term tornado refers to the <a href="vortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">vortex</a> of <a href="wind" class="uri" title="wikilink">wind</a>, not the condensation <a href="cloud" class="uri" title="wikilink">cloud</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong><a href="funnel_cloud" title="wikilink">funnel cloud</a></strong> is a visible condensation funnel with no associated strong winds at the surface. Not all funnel clouds evolve into a tornado. However, many tornadoes are preceded by a funnel cloud as the mesocyclonic rotation descends toward the ground. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to tell the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

</dl>
<p>A <strong>multiple vortex tornado</strong> is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate around a common center. Multivortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, however it is very often observed in intense tornadoes.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="Satellite_tornado" title="wikilink">Satellite tornado</a></dt>

</dl>
<p>A <strong>satellite tornado</strong> is a term for a weaker tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to &quot;<a href="orbit" class="uri" title="wikilink">orbit</a>&quot; the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct funnel, and is much smaller than the main funnel.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="Waterspout" class="uri" title="wikilink">Waterspout</a></dt>

</dl>
<p>A <strong>waterspout</strong> is a tornado over water. Although the <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">National Weather Service</a> considers waterspouts as a tornadic meteorological phenomenon, waterspouts are not counted in official tornado statistics unless they strike land. &quot;Fair weather&quot; waterspouts are less-severe relatives of classic tornadoes. They are almost always weak (F0 or F1 on the Fujita Scale), and spawn from non-rotating thunderstorms or even ordinary summer showers. Typically, when such waterspouts move onto land they cause little or no damage, and dissipate within minutes. However, strong waterspouts from <a href="supercell" title="wikilink">supercells</a> can cause significant damage. In addition, strong tornadoes can move over lakes or over the ocean, becoming waterspouts, without losing intensity.</p>
<dl>

</dl>
<p>A <strong>landspout</strong> is an unofficial term for a tornado not associated with a <a href="mesocyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">mesocyclone</a>. Landspouts most often are weak, featuring a small condensation funnel which often does not reach the ground, often marked by a tall tube of dust and/or debris reaching as far up as the parent cloud. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can cause serious damage.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>A <strong>gustnado</strong> is a small, vertical swirl associated with a <a href="Outflow_boundary" title="wikilink">gust front</a> or <a href="downburst" class="uri" title="wikilink">downburst</a>. Because they are technically not associated with the cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are actually tornadoes.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> They usually cause small areas of heavier damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.</p>

</dl>
<p>A <strong>dust devil</strong> resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are rarely as strong as even the weakest tornadoes. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with convective clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage and fatalities, especially in <a href="arid" class="uri" title="wikilink">arid</a> areas.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Tornado-like circulations occasionally occur near large, intense <a href="wildfire" title="wikilink">wildfires</a> and are called <strong>fire whirls</strong>. They are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a <a href="pyrocumulus" class="uri" title="wikilink">pyrocumulus</a> or other cumuliform cloud above.

<h3 id="shape">Shape</h3>
<p>Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow <a href="funnel" class="uri" title="wikilink">funnel</a>, a few hundred yards across, with a small cloud of <a href="debris" class="uri" title="wikilink">debris</a> near the ground. However, tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Small, relatively weak <a href="landspout" title="wikilink">landspouts</a> may only be visible as a small swirl of dust on the ground. While the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 40 mph (64 km/h), the circulation is considered a tornado.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large <a href="Wedge_(mechanical_device)" title="wikilink">wedges</a> stuck into the ground, and so are known as <em>wedge tornadoes</em> or <em>wedges</em>. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be <em>roping out</em>, or becoming a <em>rope tornado</em>. Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to these appearances, tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not spot them.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>In the United States, an average tornado is around 500 feet (150 m) across, and stays on the ground for 5 miles (8 km).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> While this is the average, there is an extremely wide range of tornado sizes, even for typical tornadoes. Weak tornadoes, or strong but dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet across. In fact, a tornado was once reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2 m) long.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A <a href="Hallam,_Nebraska_Tornado_Outbreak" title="wikilink">tornado which affected Hallam, Nebraska</a> on <a href="May_22" title="wikilink">May 22</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> was at one point 2.5 miles (4 km) wide at the ground.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of path length, the <a href="Tri-State_Tornado" title="wikilink">Tri-State Tornado</a>, which affected parts of <a href="Missouri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>, and <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> on <a href="March_18" title="wikilink">March 18</a>, <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>, was officially on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km). Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles or longer are actually a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession, however there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado began 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<p>Tornadoes, depending on the environment in which they form, can have a wide range of colors. Tornadoes which form in a dry environment can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels which pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While travelling over a body of water as a waterspout, they can turn very white or even blue. Funnels which move slowly, ingesting a lot of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning brilliantly white in the process.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Lighting conditions are also a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is &quot;<a href="Backlighting_(lighting_design)" title="wikilink">back-lit</a>&quot;, or viewed with the sun behind it, will appear to be very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes, making them &quot;invisible&quot;, in essence. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Fortunately most significant tornadoes form under the storm's <em>rain-free base</em>, or the area under the thunderstorm's updraft, where there is little or no rain. In addition, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Also, night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning. There is mounting evidence, including <a href="Doppler_On_Wheels" title="wikilink">DOW</a> mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, which suggest that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> found in <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a>. This area would be clear (possibly full of dust), have relatively light winds, and be very dark, with the light blocked out by swirling debris on the outside of the tornado. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>Tornadoes normally rotate <a href="cyclone" title="wikilink">cyclonically</a> in direction (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the <a href="Coriolis_effect" title="wikilink">Coriolis effect</a>, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of Coriolis effect is infinitesimal, as demonstrated physically by the <a href="Rossby_number" title="wikilink">Rossby number</a>. Supercells and tornadoes would rotate cyclonically even without the Coriolis effect, as evidenced by their doing so in numerical simulations which neglect the Coriolis component.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Low-level <a href="mesocyclone" title="wikilink">mesocyclones</a> and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Approximately 1% of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction. Typically, only landspouts and gustnados rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending <a href="rear_flank_downdraft" title="wikilink">RFD</a> in a cyclonic supercell.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, on rare occasions, <a href="anticyclonic_tornado" title="wikilink">anticyclonic tornadoes</a> form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado--either or a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound</h3>
<p>The sound of a tornado is classically described as being similar to that of a speeding <a href="freight_train" title="wikilink">freight train</a> rumbling in the distance.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> A tornado's sound at close range, however, is different, due to direct effects of wind and debris. <a href="Storm_chaser" title="wikilink">Storm chaser</a> <a href="Tim_Samaras" title="wikilink">Tim Samaras</a> described a tornado only 180 meters (600 ft) away as sounding &quot;like a high-powered <a href="waterfall" class="uri" title="wikilink">waterfall</a> combined with a <a href="jet_engine" title="wikilink">jet engine</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Most people residing inside their homes at the time a tornado strikes give a similar description.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="supercell-relationship">Supercell relationship</h3>

<p>Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as <em><a href="supercell" title="wikilink">supercells</a></em>. Supercells contain <a href="mesocyclone" title="wikilink">mesocyclones</a>, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1–6 miles (2–10 km) across. Most intense tornadoes (<strong>EF3</strong> to <strong>EF5</strong> on the <a href="Enhanced_Fujita_Scale" title="wikilink">Enhanced Fujita Scale</a>) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.</p>
<p>Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The cycle begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the <a href="rear_flank_downdraft" title="wikilink">rear flank downdraft</a> (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.</p>
<h3 id="tornado-formation">Tornado formation</h3>
<p>As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating <a href="wall_cloud" title="wikilink">wall cloud</a>. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud becomes a tornado within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.</p>
<p>Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist inflow to power it, so it grows until it reaches the <em>mature stage</em>. During its mature stage, which can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, a tornado often causes the most damage, and can in rare instances be more than one mile across. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which feeds the tornado.</p>
<h3 id="maturity-and-demise">Maturity and demise</h3>
<p>As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, becoming thin and rope-like. This is the <em>dissipating stage</em>; often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado fizzles. During the dissipating stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. In particularly intense supercells tornadoes can develop <a href="wiktionary:cycle" title="wikilink">cyclically</a>. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (<em>occluded</em>) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.</p>
<p>Though this is a widely-accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by <a href="expert_elicitation" title="wikilink">expert elicitation</a>) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An <strong>EF0</strong> tornado will likely damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an <strong>EF5</strong> tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar <a href="TORRO_scale" title="wikilink">TORRO scale</a> ranges from a <strong>T0</strong> for extremely weak tornadoes to <strong>T11</strong> for the most powerful known tornadoes. Radar data, <a href="photogrammetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">photogrammetry</a>, and ground swirl patterns may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.</p>
<p>Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. <a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> </ref> In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from <a href="multiple_vortex_tornado" title="wikilink">subvortices</a>. <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

Strong mesocyclones show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado." width="250" /> Rigorous attempts to give warning for tornadoes began in the United States in the middle of the 20th century. Before the <a href="1950s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950s</a>, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would not reach the local Weather Forecast Office until after the storm was over. However, with the advent of <a href="weather_radar" title="wikilink">weather radar</a>, areas near a weather service office could get advance warning of severe weather. With the discovery of the <a href="hook_echo" title="wikilink">hook echo</a> in 1953, meteorologists gained the ability to detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away by recognizing the radar signatures associated with many tornadoes.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>, the US National Weather Service began increased efforts to train <a href="Skywarn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skywarn</a> spotters, consisting of local <a href="sheriff" title="wikilink">sheriff's deputies</a>, <a href="State_police" title="wikilink">state troopers</a>, <a href="firefighter" title="wikilink">firefighters</a>, <a href="amateur_radio_operator" title="wikilink">amateur radio operators</a>, <a href="civil_defense" title="wikilink">civil defense</a> (now <a href="emergency_management" title="wikilink">emergency management</a>) spotters, <a href="storm_chaser" title="wikilink">storm chasers</a>, and ordinary citizens, to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters be on the lookout for severe weather, and report any possible tornadoes immediately, so the office can issue a timely warning..<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> There are currently more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In Canada, a similar network of Volunteer Weather Watchers now exists to help spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of <a href="http://www.skywarn.eu/">Skywarn Europe</a> and the <a href="Tornado_and_Storm_Research_Organisation_(TORRO)" title="wikilink">Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)</a> has maintained a network of spotters in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most developed countries have a network of <a href="weather_radar" title="wikilink">weather radars</a>, which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, <a href="Doppler_radar" title="wikilink">doppler weather radar</a> stations are used as the main detection method for tornadic thunderstorms. These devices are capable of measuring the velocity and radial <a href="direction" class="uri" title="wikilink">direction</a> (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles away. Additionally, most populated areas of the earth are now visible from the <a href="Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite" title="wikilink">Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites</a> (GOES), which aid in the detection of tornadic storms.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

This tornado, likely an <strong>EF5</strong> (though this was before the era where tornadoes were ranked on any damage scale), set (and still holds) records for the deadliest single United States tornado (695 dead), longest path length (219 miles, 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph, 117 km/h).<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> It was also the second costliest tornado in history at the time, but has since been surpassed by several others non-normalized, it still ranks third when normalized for wealth and inflation.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>The most extensive <a href="tornado_outbreak" title="wikilink">tornado outbreak</a> on record, in almost every category, was the <a href="Super_Outbreak" title="wikilink">Super Outbreak</a>, which affected a large area of the Central United States and extreme southern <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a> in Canada on April 3 and 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature an incredible 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented amount of them were violent; six of the tornadoes were of <strong>F5</strong> intensity, and 24 were of <strong>F4</strong> intensity. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>While it is nearly impossible to directly measure the most violent tornado wind speeds (conventional <a href="anemometer" title="wikilink">anemometers</a> would be destroyed by the intense winds), some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile <a href="doppler_radar" title="wikilink">doppler radar</a> units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 <a href="&lt;U+00B1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B1&gt;</a> 20 mph (484 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 32 km/h) in the <strong>F5</strong> Moore, Oklahoma tornado.

<p>Storms which produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts (sometimes exceeding 150 mph, 240 km/h). As such, debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm, and be carried for very long distances. A tornado which affected <a href="Great_Bend,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Great Bend, Kansas</a> in November, 1915 was an extreme case, where a &quot;rain of debris&quot; occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of <a href="flour" class="uri" title="wikilink">flour</a> was found 110 miles (177 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of <a href="Palmyra,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Palmyra, Nebraska</a>, 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p><img src="Tornado_safety_in_schools.png" title="fig:Tornado Safety in Schools" alt="Tornado Safety in Schools" width="250" /> Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the <a href="Storm_Prediction_Center" title="wikilink">Storm Prediction Center</a> advise having a tornado plan. When a tornado warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have <a href="storm_cellar" title="wikilink">storm cellars</a> on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as <a href="tornado_watch" title="wikilink">tornado watches</a> and <a href="Tornado_warning" title="wikilink">warnings</a> in the United States and Canada). <a href="Weather_radio" title="wikilink">Weather radios</a> provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States.</p>
<p>Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are extremely bad shelter during tornadoes (see next section).<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="myths-and-misconceptions">Myths and misconceptions</h2>

<p>One of the most persistent myths associated with tornadoes is that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a> inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Some research indicates that opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. Regardless of the validity of the explosion claim, time would be better spent seeking shelter before a tornado than opening windows. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

This tornado disproved several myths, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in areas like Utah." width="250" /> Another commonly held belief is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. On the contrary, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado. In the <a href="Oklahoma_Tornado_Outbreak" title="wikilink">Oklahoma Tornado Outbreak</a> of <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at all three there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. The small area under the overpasses created a kind of <a href="wind_tunnel" title="wikilink">wind tunnel</a>, increasing the wind's speed, making the situation worse.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter under a sturdy table, in a basement, or under a staircase increases chances of survival even more.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by a major river, a hill or mountain, or even protected by &quot;<a href="spirit" title="wikilink">spirits</a>&quot;. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, and affect valleys. As a general rule, no area is &quot;safe&quot; from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.

Although studied for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Scientists do have a fairly good idea of the development of thunderstorms and <a href="mesocyclone" title="wikilink">mesocyclones</a>, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation; however, the step from <a href="supercell" class="uri" title="wikilink">supercell</a> (or other respective formative processes) to <a href="tornadogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tornadogenesis</a> and predicting tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well understood and is the focus of much research.</p>
<p>Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level <a href="vorticity" class="uri" title="wikilink">vorticity</a> which tightens into a tornado, namely, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.</p>
<p>Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with <a href="mesovortice" title="wikilink">mesovortices</a> within linear thunderstorm structures and with tropical cyclones.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued, especially in under-developed countries. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Research programs, including <a href="VORTEX" class="uri" title="wikilink">VORTEX</a>, deployment of <a href="TOtable_Tornado_Observatory" title="wikilink">TOTO</a> (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), <a href="Doppler_On_Wheels" title="wikilink">Doppler On Wheels</a> (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a>. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.</p>
