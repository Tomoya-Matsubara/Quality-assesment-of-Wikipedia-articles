<h2 id="playing-career">Playing career</h2>
<p>Ole-Kristian Tollefsen started his ice hockey career playing for <a href="Nes_IK" title="wikilink">Nes IK</a>'s youth teams, after one of his friends had talked him into it. He played for teams in the club until he turned 16, when he moved to <a href="Lillehammer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lillehammer</a>, to attend <a href="Norges_Toppidrettsgymnas" title="wikilink">Norges Toppidrettsgymnas</a>. Tollefsen played with <a href="Lillehammer_Ishockeyklubb" title="wikilink">Lillehammer Ishockeyklubb</a> for two seasons, spending most of that time on the senior team, instead of any of the club's two junior teams where a player his age should have spent that stage of career. During the 2001-02 season, he was a regular in the team's starting lineup as they reached fourth spot in the <a href="GET-ligaen" title="wikilink">Norwegian Elite League</a>, and reached the play off semi-finals for a bronze medal. He also played for both the junior teams in their playoffs, getting a silver medal with the Elder Junior(Under-20) team, and the gold medal with the Younger Junior(U-18) team. Those medals was the last thing he did in the Norwegian league system, so far in his career.</p>
<p>After that impressive season, Tollefsen was drafted by the <a href="Columbus_Blue_Jackets" title="wikilink">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> in the third round, 65th overall, in the <a href="2002_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">2002 NHL Entry Draft</a>, something that made him one of the highest-drafted Norwegians ever (incidentally, the highest-drafted Norwegian ever, <a href="Dallas_Stars" title="wikilink">Dallas Stars</a> prospect <a href="Marius_Holtet" title="wikilink">Marius Holtet</a>, went in the second round, as the 42nd overall pick in the same draft).</p>
<p>The next stop for Tollefsen was the <a href="Western_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">Western Hockey League</a> where he played the next two seasons for the <a href="Brandon_Wheat_Kings" title="wikilink">Brandon Wheat Kings</a>. During his time in the WHL, he showed that he could adapt to the North American style of play. His physical style of play showed on the 2003-04 Blue Jackets training camp, when one of his hits put star player <a href="Geoff_Sanderson" title="wikilink">Geoff Sanderson</a> out of play for a couple of weeks with an injury.</p>
<p>During the 2004-05 NHL lockout season, Tollefsen had signed for the Blue Jackets, but spent most of the season with the <a href="Syracuse_Crunch" title="wikilink">Syracuse Crunch</a> of the <a href="American_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">American Hockey League</a>, but also had a short trip to the <a href="East_Coast_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">East Coast Hockey League</a> where he played for the <a href="Dayton_Bombers" title="wikilink">Dayton Bombers</a>.</p>
<p>For the <a href="2005-06_NHL_Season" title="wikilink">2005-06 NHL Season</a> he started the season in the AHL, but on November 23, he got his NHL debut in a 4-2 loss against the <a href="Phoenix_Coyotes" title="wikilink">Phoenix Coyotes</a>. He got an additional four games for the Blue Jackets, with two penalty minutes, before he was sent down to Syracuse again, where he spent the rest of the season.</p>
<p>He played in 70 of the Blue Jackets' games in the <a href="2006-07_NHL_season" title="wikilink">2006-07 NHL season</a>. On November 10, he, and fellow Norwegian NHL player <a href="Patrick_Thoresen" title="wikilink">Patrick Thoresen</a> played in the first game ever to have two Norwegian players facing each other, when the Blue Jackets hosted Thoresen's <a href="Edmonton_Oilers" title="wikilink">Edmonton Oilers</a>. In <a href="Ken_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Ken Hitchcock</a>'s debut as the coach for the Blue Jackets, a November 24 away game against the <a href="Philadelphia_Flyers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, Tollefsen had his first career NHL point when he assisted on <a href="Jason_Chimera" title="wikilink">Jason Chimera</a>'s second period goal, he scored his first goal against the <a href="Chicago_Blackhawks" title="wikilink">Chicago Blackhawks</a> on March 20. 2007. He put up a scoring streak when he forced overtime against <a href="Detroit_Red_Wings" title="wikilink">Detroit Red Wings</a> in the next game, tying <a href="Espen_Knutsen" title="wikilink">Espen Knutsen</a>'s Norwegian NHL record. He accumulated 125 penalty minutes during the season, including fights against <a href="Mark_Smith" title="wikilink">Mark Smith</a>, <a href="Joffrey_Lupul" title="wikilink">Joffrey Lupul</a>, <a href="Jordin_Tootoo" title="wikilink">Jordin Tootoo</a> and <a href="Bill_Guerin" title="wikilink">Bill Guerin</a>.</p>
<p>Tollefsen is one of only five Norwegians to ever play in the NHL, the others being <a href="Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn_Skaare" title="wikilink">Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn Skaare</a>, <a href="Anders_Myrvold" title="wikilink">Anders Myrvold</a>, <a href="Espen_Knutsen" title="wikilink">Espen Knutsen</a>, and <a href="Patrick_Thoresen" title="wikilink">Patrick Thoresen</a>.</p>
