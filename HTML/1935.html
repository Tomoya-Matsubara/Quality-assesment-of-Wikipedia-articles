<p>The mountain known to the <a href="Lakota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lakota</a> Sioux as <strong>Six Grandfathers</strong> was renamed after <a href="Charles_E._Rushmore" title="wikilink">Charles E.

After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President <a href="Calvin_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Calvin Coolidge</a>, the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941, and although there were a few injuries, no deaths occurred.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The geological formation of Mount Rushmore was known to the <a href="Lakota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lakota</a> as <strong>Six Grandfathers</strong> and was part of the route that Lakota leader <a href="Black_Elk" title="wikilink">Black Elk</a> took in a well-known spiritual journey that culminated at <a href="Harney_Peak" title="wikilink">Harney Peak</a>. Following a series of military campaigns in 1876-77, the United States asserted territorial control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 <a href="Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie_(1868)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Fort Laramie</a> (see <em>Controversy</em> below). Among white American settlers, the peak was known variously as <strong>Cougar Mountain</strong>, <strong>Sugarloaf Mountain</strong>, <strong>Slaughterhouse Mountain</strong>, and <strong>Keystone Cliffs</strong>. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Rushmore, David Swanzey and Bill Challis.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Doane_Robinson" title="wikilink">Doane Robinson</a>, a historian, conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 in order to attract greater <a href="tourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourism</a> to South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor <a href="Gutzon_Borglum" title="wikilink">Gutzon Borglum</a> to go to the Black Hills region to ensure that the carving could be accomplished. Borglum, a member of the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, was then involved in sculpting a massive <a href="bas-relief" class="uri" title="wikilink">bas-relief</a> memorial to <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> leaders on <a href="Stone_Mountain" title="wikilink">Stone Mountain</a> in <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The original plan was to do the carvings in the <a href="Needles_(Black_Hills)" title="wikilink">Needles</a>, several granite pillars. However, Borglum realized that that plan could not be carried out because the Needles, worn down by erosion, were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander spot, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, <em>&quot;America will march along that skyline.&quot;</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on <a href="March_3" title="wikilink">March 3</a>, <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> President Coolidge insisted that along with Washington, two Republicans and one Democrat be portrayed.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Engineer <a href="Julian_Spotts" title="wikilink">Julian Spotts</a> helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded such that it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By <a href="July_4" title="wikilink">July 4</a>, <a href="1934" class="uri" title="wikilink">1934</a>, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on <a href="September_17" title="wikilink">September 17</a>, <a href="1937" class="uri" title="wikilink">1937</a>. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil rights leader <a href="Susan_B._Anthony" title="wikilink">Susan B. Anthony</a>, but a <a href="rider_(legislation)" title="wikilink">rider</a> was passed on an appropriations bill requiring that federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.</p>
<p><img src="Mountrushmorephoto.jpg" title="fig:A model at the site depicting Mount Rushmore&#39;s intended final design" alt="A model at the site depicting Mount Rushmore&#39;s intended final design" width="375" /> The Sculptor's Studio was built in 1939 under the direction of Gutzon Borglum. Unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting process are displayed there. Borglum died from an embolism in March of 1941. His son, <a href="Lincoln_Borglum" title="wikilink">Lincoln Borglum</a>, continued the project, but insufficient funding forced the carving to end.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Originally, it was planned that the sculpture would be carved from head to waist.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Borglum also planned a massive panel in the shape of the <a href="Louisiana_Purchase" title="wikilink">Louisiana Purchase</a> commemorating in eight-foot-high gilded letters the <a href="Declaration_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Declaration of Independence</a>, <a href="U.S._Constitution" title="wikilink">U.S. Constitution</a>, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a> to <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> to the <a href="Panama_Canal_Zone" title="wikilink">Panama Canal Zone</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>On <a href="October_15" title="wikilink">October 15</a>, <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, Mount Rushmore was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>. An essay from <a href="Nebraska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a> student William Andrew Burkett was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973.

<p>Ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998. These include a Visitor Center, Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial presents a unique challenge for conservators, often requiring mountain climbing to remove <a href="lichen" title="wikilink">lichens</a> and generally clean the memorial. On <a href="July_8" title="wikilink">July 8</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, <a href="K&lt;U+00E4&gt;rcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00E4&gt;rcher</a> GmbH, a German manufacturer of cleaning machines, conducted a cleanup operation of the faces by pressure washing for free. The washing used pressurized water that was 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<p><img src="Air_Force_One_over_Mt._Rushmore.jpg" title="fig:Air Force One flying over Mt. Rushmore" alt="Air Force One flying over Mt. Rushmore" width="250" /> Mount Rushmore is controversial among <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> because the United States seized the area from the <a href="Lakota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lakota</a> tribe after the <a href="Black_Hills_War" title="wikilink">Black Hills War</a> in 1876&lt;U+2013&gt;77. The <a href="Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie_(1868)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)</a> had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. The Lakota consider the hills to be sacred, although historians believe the Lakota also gained control of the hills by force, displacing the <a href="Cheyenne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cheyenne</a> in 1776. Members of the <a href="American_Indian_Movement" title="wikilink">American Indian Movement</a> led an <a href="occupation_(protest)" title="wikilink">occupation</a> of the monument in 1971, naming it &quot;Mount Crazy Horse.&quot; Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer, who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents faces &quot;which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The Monument continues to be a subject of controversy among Native Americans, even after the appointment of Gerard Baker, the first Native American superintendent of the park in 2004.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The <a href="Crazy_Horse_Memorial" title="wikilink">Crazy Horse Memorial</a> is being built elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate a famous Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore. It is intended to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs, though the monument is not being financed with <a href="U.S._Government" title="wikilink">federal</a> funds for the most part.</p>
<h2 id="ecology">Ecology</h2>
<p>The flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. The memorial serves as home to many animals and plants representative of the Black Hills. Several birds like the <a href="Turkey_Vulture" title="wikilink">turkey vulture</a>, <a href="Bald_Eagle" title="wikilink">bald eagle</a>, <a href="hawk" class="uri" title="wikilink">hawk</a>, and <a href="meadowlark" class="uri" title="wikilink">meadowlark</a> fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making <a href="Nest" title="wikilink">nesting spots</a> in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, <a href="Nuthatch" title="wikilink">nuthatches</a>, and <a href="woodpecker" title="wikilink">woodpeckers</a>, inhabit the surrounding pine forests. Terrestrial mammals include the <a href="mouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">mouse</a>, <a href="chipmunk" class="uri" title="wikilink">chipmunk</a>, <a href="squirrel" class="uri" title="wikilink">squirrel</a>, <a href="skunk" class="uri" title="wikilink">skunk</a>, <a href="porcupine" class="uri" title="wikilink">porcupine</a>, <a href="raccoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">raccoon</a>, <a href="beaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaver</a>, <a href="badger" class="uri" title="wikilink">badger</a>, <a href="coyote" class="uri" title="wikilink">coyote</a>, <a href="Bighorn_Sheep" title="wikilink">bighorn sheep</a> and <a href="bobcat" class="uri" title="wikilink">bobcat</a>. In addition, several species of frogs and snakes inhabit the region. The two brooks in the memorial, the Grizzly Bear and Starling Basin brooks, support fish like the <a href="Dace" title="wikilink">longnose dace</a> and the <a href="brook_trout" title="wikilink">brook trout</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Some endemic animals are not indigenous to the area; the <a href="mountain_goats" title="wikilink">mountain goats</a> are descended from goats which were a gift from <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> to <a href="Custer_State_Park" title="wikilink">Custer State Park</a> in 1924 but later escaped.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>At lower elevations, <a href="coniferous" class="uri" title="wikilink">coniferous</a> trees, mainly the <a href="Ponderosa_Pine" title="wikilink">Ponderosa pine</a>, surround most of the monument, providing much shade from the sun. Other trees include the <a href="bur_oak" title="wikilink">bur oak</a>, the <a href="Spruce" title="wikilink">Black Hills spruce</a>, and the <a href="cottonwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">cottonwood</a>. Nine species of shrubs live near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the <a href="Antirrhinum" title="wikilink">snapdragon</a>, <a href="sunflower" class="uri" title="wikilink">sunflower</a>, and <a href="Violet_(plant)" title="wikilink">violet</a>. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> However, only approximately 5% of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Though the area receives about 18 inches (460 mm) of precipitation on average per year, alone it is not enough to support the abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control <a href="surface_runoff" title="wikilink">surface runoff</a>. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a> and [limestone] help to hold <a href="groundwater" class="uri" title="wikilink">groundwater</a>, creating <a href="aquifer" title="wikilink">aquifers</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Forest_fire" title="wikilink">Forest fires</a> occur in the Ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. This was determined from fire scars in tree core samples. These help to clean forest debris located on the ground. Large conflagrations are rare, but have occurred in the past.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>
<p><img src="Mt_rushmore_07_27_2005.jpg" title="fig:Mt Rushmore, showing full size of mountain and the scree of debris from construction." alt="Mt Rushmore, showing full size of mountain and the scree of debris from construction." /> Mount Rushmore is largely composed of <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a>. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the <a href="Harney_Peak" title="wikilink">Harney Peak</a> granite <a href="batholith" class="uri" title="wikilink">batholith</a> in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith <a href="magma" class="uri" title="wikilink">magma</a> intruded into the pre-existing <a href="mica" class="uri" title="wikilink">mica</a> <a href="schist" class="uri" title="wikilink">schist</a> rocks during the <a href="Precambrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Precambrian</a> period about 1.6 billion years ago.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, the uneven cooling of the molten rock caused the formation of both fine and coarse-grained minerals, including <a href="quartz" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartz</a>, <a href="feldspar" class="uri" title="wikilink">feldspar</a>, <a href="muscovite" class="uri" title="wikilink">muscovite</a>, and <a href="biotite" class="uri" title="wikilink">biotite</a>. Fractures in the granite were sealed by <a href="pegmatite" class="uri" title="wikilink">pegmatite</a> <a href="dike_(geology)" title="wikilink">dikes</a>. The light colored streaks in the presidents' foreheads are due to these dikes.</p>
<p>The Black Hills granites were exposed to <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> during the late Precambrian, but were buried by <a href="sandstone" title="wikilink">sandstones</a> and other sediments during the <a href="Cambrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambrian</a> Period. The area remained buried throughout the <a href="Paleozoic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleozoic</a> Era, but was exposed again to erosion during the <a href="Plate_tectonics" title="wikilink">tectonic</a> uplift about 70 million years ago.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome which towered some 20,000 feet (6 km) above sea level, but erosion wore the area down to only 4,000 ft (1.2 km).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The subsequent natural erosion of this mountain range allowed the carvings by stripping the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schists. The contact between the granite and darker schist is viewable just below the sculpture of Washington.</p>
<p>Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site of carving for several reasons. The rock of the mountain was composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The granite was very resistant, eroding only 1 inch (2.5 cm) every 10,000 years, indicating that it was sturdy enough to support sculpting.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In addition, it was the tallest mountain in the surrounding terrain, looming to a height of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Because the mountain faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of having the sunlight for most of the day.</p>
<h2 id="tourism">Tourism</h2>
<p><img src="MtRushmoreEnter.jpg" title="fig:The entrance to the site" alt="The entrance to the site" width="200" /> Tourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry. Mount Rushmore is the number one tourist attraction of South Dakota. In 2004, over 2 million visitors traveled to the memorial.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The Lincoln Borglum Museum is located in the memorial. It features two 125-seat theaters that show a 13-minute movie about Mount Rushmore. One of the best viewpoints is located at Grandview Terrace, above the Lincoln Borglum Museum. The Presidential Trail, a walking trail and boardwalk, starts at Grandview Terrace and winds through the <a href="Ponderosa_Pine" title="wikilink">Ponderosa pine</a> forests to the Sculptor's Studio, providing close-up views of the memorial. The Sculptor's studio was built by <a href="Gutzon_Borglum" title="wikilink">Gutzon Borglum</a>, and features discussion about the construction of the monument as well as the tools used. The amphitheater also has a 30-minute program at dusk that describes the construction of the memorial. Following that, the mountain is illuminated for two hours.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="South_Dakota_quarter,_reverse_side,_2006.jpg" title="fig:Mount Rushmore as depicted on the South Dakota state quarter" alt="Mount Rushmore as depicted on the South Dakota state quarter" /> Because Mount Rushmore has large carved faces, appearances of Mount Rushmore in the media often include a replacement of one or more of the four presidents' faces with other people or characters. In <em><a href="Superman_II" title="wikilink">Superman II</a></em>, General Zod and his criminal partners use their superpowers to replace three of the carvings with their own faces and wipe out the fourth.

The mountain has had a fifth face carved into it, that of fictional president <a href="Elaine_Salinger" title="wikilink">Elaine Salinger</a>. In <em><a href="Naruto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naruto</a></em>, there is a mountain in Konoha with the faces of the Hokages on them.</p>
<p>Because the mountain is an important historical <a href="landmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">landmark</a>, it is often used as a base for various action-themed movies and books. Mount Rushmore is featured in <em><a href="Team_America:_World_Police" title="wikilink">Team America: World Police</a></em> as the Team America headquarters, where it was destroyed by <a href="Michael_Moore" title="wikilink">Michael Moore</a>'s suicide bomb. In <a href="Wildstorm" title="wikilink">Wildstorm Comics</a>, the alien superhero <a href="Mister_Majestic" title="wikilink">Mr. Majestic</a> has his secret base inside Mount Rushmore.

<p>The memorial was famously used as the location of the final chase scene in <a href="Alfred_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <a href="film" title="wikilink">movie</a> <em><a href="North_by_Northwest" title="wikilink">North by Northwest</a></em>. However, it was not actually filmed at the monument, since permission to shoot an attempted killing on the face of a national monument was refused by the Park Service. Closeups were shot on a set. In the <a href="Family_Guy" title="wikilink">Family Guy</a> episode &quot;<a href="North_by_North_Quahog" title="wikilink">North by North Quahog</a>&quot;, Peter and Lois are chased down the monument by Mel Gibson after stealing a copy of his new movie, &quot;Passion Of The Christ 2: Crucify This&quot; in a spoof of the chase scene from <em>North by Northwest</em>.
