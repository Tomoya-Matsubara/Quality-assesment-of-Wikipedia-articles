The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the <a href="endling" title="wikilink">last individual</a> of the species, although the <a href="Functional_extinction" title="wikilink">capacity to breed and recover</a> may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential <a href="Range_(biology)" title="wikilink">range</a> may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as <a href="Lazarus_taxon" title="wikilink">Lazarus taxa</a>, where a species presumed extinct abruptly &quot;re-appears&quot; (typically in the <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossil record</a>) after a period of apparent absence.</p>

<p>A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become <a href="functional_extinction" title="wikilink">functionally extinct</a> when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in <a href="sexual_reproduction" title="wikilink">sexually reproducing</a> species), or other reasons.</p>
<p>Pinpointing the extinction (or <a href="pseudoextinction" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudoextinction</a>) of a species requires a <a href="Theory_of_species" title="wikilink">clear definition of that species</a>. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the <a href="punctuated_equilibrium" title="wikilink">punctuated equilibrium</a> hypothesis of <a href="Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="wikilink">Stephen Jay Gould</a> and <a href="Niles_Eldredge" title="wikilink">Niles Eldredge</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="ecology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecology</a>, <em>extinction</em> is often used informally to refer to <a href="local_extinction" title="wikilink">local extinction</a>, in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; <a href="wolf_reintroduction" title="wikilink">wolf reintroduction</a> is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed <a href="Extant_taxon" title="wikilink">extant</a>. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as <a href="threatened" class="uri" title="wikilink">threatened</a> or <a href="endangered_species" title="wikilink">endangered species</a>.</p>
<p>Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the <a href="conservation_status" title="wikilink">conservation status</a> <a href="extinct_in_the_wild" title="wikilink">&quot;extinct in the wild&quot; (EW)</a>. Species listed under this status by the <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in <a href="zoo" title="wikilink">zoos</a> or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> When possible, modern <a href="zoology" title="wikilink">zoological</a> institutions try to maintain a <a href="viable_population" title="wikilink">viable population</a> for species preservation and possible future <a href="reintroduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">reintroduction</a> to the wild, through use of carefully planned <a href="breeding_program" title="wikilink">breeding programs</a>.</p>
<p>The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called &quot;chains of extinction&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This is especially common with extinction of <a href="keystone_species" title="wikilink">keystone species</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pseudoextinction">Pseudoextinction</h3>

<p>Descendants may or may not exist for extinct species. Daughter species that evolve from a parent species carry on most of the parent species' <a href="genotype" title="wikilink">genetic information</a>, and even though the parent species may become extinct, the daughter species lives on. Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction. In other cases, species have produced no new variants, or none that are able to survive the parent species' extinction.</p>
<p>Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct <em><a href="Hyracotherium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hyracotherium</a></em>, which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern <a href="horse" class="uri" title="wikilink">horse</a>, is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of <em><a href="Equus_(genus)" title="wikilink">Equus</a></em>, including <a href="zebra" class="uri" title="wikilink">zebra</a> and <a href="donkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">donkey</a>. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether <em>Hyracotherium</em> <a href="Evolution_of_the_horse" title="wikilink">evolved into more modern horse species</a> or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.</p>

<p>As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average life-span of a species is 10 million years, although this varies widely between taxa. There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. &quot;Just as each species is unique&quot;, write Beverly and <a href="Stephen_C._Stearns" title="wikilink">Stephen C. Stearns</a>, &quot;so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied&lt;U+2014&gt;some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Most simply, any species that cannot <a href="Survival_skills" title="wikilink">survive</a> and <a href="reproduction" title="wikilink">reproduce</a> in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when <a href="toxic" class="uri" title="wikilink">toxic</a> <a href="pollution" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollution</a> renders its entire <a href="habitat" class="uri" title="wikilink">habitat</a> unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as <a href="extinction_debt" title="wikilink">extinction debt</a>.</p>
<p>Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on <a href="nature_and_nurture" title="wikilink">nature and nurture</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The question of whether more extinctions in the <a href="fossil" class="uri" title="wikilink">fossil</a> record have been caused by <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of <em>Modeling Extinction</em>, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> By contrast, <a href="conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation biology</a> uses the <a href="extinction_vortex" title="wikilink">extinction vortex</a> model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about <a href="human_extinction" title="wikilink">human extinction</a> have been raised, for example in Sir <a href="Martin_Rees" title="wikilink">Martin Rees</a>' 2003 book <em><a href="Our_Final_Hour" title="wikilink">Our Final Hour</a></em>, those concerns lie with the effects of <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> or <a href="technology" title="wikilink">technological</a> disaster.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of <a href="conservation_movement" title="wikilink">conservation</a> programs.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Humans can cause extinction of a species through <a href="overharvesting" class="uri" title="wikilink">overharvesting</a>, <a href="pollution" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollution</a>, <a href="habitat_destruction" title="wikilink">habitat destruction</a>, introduction of <a href="invasive_species" title="wikilink">invasive species</a> (such as new <a href="predator" title="wikilink">predators</a> and food <a href="competitors" class="uri" title="wikilink">competitors</a>), overhunting, and other influences.

<h3 id="genetics-and-demographic-phenomena">Genetics and demographic phenomena</h3>

<p><a href="Population_genetics" title="wikilink">Population genetics</a> and demographic phenomena affect the evolution, and therefore the risk of extinction, of species. Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as <a href="#Mass_extinctions" title="wikilink">mass extinction</a> arises.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Natural_selection" title="wikilink">Natural selection</a> acts to propagate beneficial genetic traits and eliminate weaknesses. But a deleterious mutation can also be spread throughout a population through <a href="genetic_drift" title="wikilink">genetic drift</a>.</p>
<p>Because traits are selected and not genes, the relationship between genetic diversity and extinction risk can be complex: factors such as <a href="balancing_selection" title="wikilink">balancing selection</a>, <a href="cryptic_genetic_variation" title="wikilink">cryptic genetic variation</a>, <a href="phenotypic_plasticity" title="wikilink">phenotypic plasticity</a>, and <a href="degeneracy_(biology)" title="wikilink">degeneracy</a> all potentially play roles.</p>
<p>A diverse or deep <a href="gene_pool" title="wikilink">gene pool</a> gives a population a higher chance of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in <a href="genetic_diversity" title="wikilink">genetic diversity</a> can increase the chances of extinction of a species. <a href="Population_bottleneck" title="wikilink">Population bottlenecks</a> can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make <a href="inbreeding" class="uri" title="wikilink">inbreeding</a> more frequent. The <a href="founder_effect" title="wikilink">founder effect</a> can cause rapid, individual-based speciation and is the most dramatic example of a population bottleneck.</p>

Such extinctions are not always apparent from <a href="morphology_(biology)" title="wikilink">morphological</a> (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of <a href="gene_flow" title="wikilink">gene flow</a> is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="habitat-degradation">Habitat degradation</h3>

<p>Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' <a href="habitat_(ecology)" title="wikilink">habitat</a> may alter the <a href="fitness_landscape" title="wikilink">fitness landscape</a> to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming <a href="toxicity" title="wikilink">toxic</a>, or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.</p>
<p>Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through <a href="contamination" class="uri" title="wikilink">contamination</a> or <a href="Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="wikilink">sterilizing</a> them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.</p>
<p>Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of <a href="tropical_rainforest" title="wikilink">tropical rainforests</a> and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a <a href="fern" class="uri" title="wikilink">fern</a> that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by <a href="bottom_trawling" title="wikilink">bottom trawling</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. <a href="Global_warming" title="wikilink">Global warming</a> has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.</p>

<h3 id="predation-competition-and-disease">Predation, competition, and disease</h3>
<p>In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by <a href="introduced_species" title="wikilink">transporting</a> <a href="animal" title="wikilink">animals</a> and <a href="plant" title="wikilink">plants</a> from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. <a href="livestock" class="uri" title="wikilink">livestock</a> released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. <a href="rat" title="wikilink">rats</a> escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an <a href="Invasive_species" title="wikilink">invasive alien species</a> does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect <a href="Endemic_(ecology)" title="wikilink">native</a> species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing <a href="pathogen" title="wikilink">pathogens</a> or <a href="parasite" title="wikilink">parasites</a> that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the &quot;overkill hypothesis&quot;, the swift extinction of the <a href="megafauna" class="uri" title="wikilink">megafauna</a> in areas such as <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> (40,000 years before present), <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North</a> and <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a> (12,000 years before present), <a href="Madagascar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Hawaii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a> (300-1000 CE), and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> (1300-1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of <a href="parasitism" title="wikilink">parasitic</a> insects following the loss of their hosts.

While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Coextinction is especially common when a <a href="keystone_species" title="wikilink">keystone species</a> goes extinct. Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the <a href="trophic_level" title="wikilink">trophic levels</a>. Such effects are most severe in <a href="mutualism_(biology)" title="wikilink">mutualistic</a> and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the <a href="Haast&#39;s_eagle" title="wikilink">Haast's eagle</a> and the <a href="moa" class="uri" title="wikilink">moa</a>: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="mass-extinctions">Mass extinctions</h2>


<p>There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 3.5 billion years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time. A massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the &quot;<a href="Permian&lt;U+2013&gt;Triassic_extinction_event" title="wikilink">Permian&lt;U+2013&gt;Triassic extinction event</a>&quot; about 250 million years ago,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction, known as <a href="Olson&#39;s_Extinction" title="wikilink">Olson's Extinction</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The <a href="Cretaceous&lt;U+2013&gt;Paleogene_extinction_event" title="wikilink">Cretaceous&lt;U+2013&gt;Paleogene extinction event</a> (K-Pg) occurred 66 million years ago, at the end of the <a href="Cretaceous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cretaceous</a> period, and is best known for having wiped out non-avian <a href="dinosaur" title="wikilink">dinosaurs</a>, among many other species.</p>
<h3 id="modern-extinctions">Modern extinctions</h3>


<p>According to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>'s <a href="American_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="wikilink">American Museum of Natural History</a>, nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused extinction,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> known as the <a href="Holocene_extinction" title="wikilink">Holocene extinction</a>. In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). Biologist <a href="E._O._Wilson" title="wikilink">E. O. Wilson</a> estimated <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> More significantly, the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1000 times &quot;background&quot; rates (the average extinction rates in the <a href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolutionary</a> time scale of planet Earth),<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> However, some groups are going extinct much faster. Amphibians, for example, are disappearing at as much as 45,000 times their extinction rate at K-Pg.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Despite such extreme losses on a global scale, the public's interest in extinction is in a world-wide decline.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>When it was first described in the 1750s, the idea of extinction was threatening to those who held a belief in the <a href="great_chain_of_being" title="wikilink">great chain of being</a>, a <a href="theology" title="wikilink">theological</a> position that did not allow for &quot;missing links&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The possibility of extinction was not widely accepted before the 1800s.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The devoted naturalist <a href="Carl_Linnaeus" title="wikilink">Carl Linnaeus</a> could &quot;hardly entertain&quot; the idea that humans could cause the extinction of a species.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply &quot;hiding&quot; in unexplored regions of the Earth.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <a href="Georges_Cuvier" title="wikilink">Georges Cuvier</a> is credited with establishing extinction as a fact in a 1796 lecture to the <a href="French_Institute" title="wikilink">French Institute</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Cuvier's observations of fossil bones convinced him that they did not originate in extant animals.

<h2 id="human-attitudes-and-interests">Human attitudes and interests</h2>
<p>Extinction is an important research topic in the field of <a href="zoology" class="uri" title="wikilink">zoology</a>, and <a href="biology" class="uri" title="wikilink">biology</a> in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the <a href="WWF_(conservation_organization)" title="wikilink">Worldwide Fund for Nature</a>, have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. <a href="Government" title="wikilink">Governments</a> have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and <a href="pollution" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollution</a>. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous <a href="virus" title="wikilink">viruses</a>, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were &quot;undesirable&quot;, or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the <a href="American_bison" title="wikilink">American bison</a>, which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>, many of whom relied on the bison for food.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Biologist Bruce Walsh of the <a href="University_of_Arizona" title="wikilink">University of Arizona</a> states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species; genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and <a href="ethics" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethics</a>;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> and today the scientific community &quot;stress[es] the importance&quot; of maintaining biodiversity.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on <em><a href="Homo_sapiens" title="wikilink">Homo sapiens</a></em> can be devastating to wildlife (for example, <a href="DDT" class="uri" title="wikilink">DDT</a>).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> <a href="Biogeography" title="wikilink">Biogeographer</a> <a href="Jared_Diamond" title="wikilink">Jared Diamond</a> notes that while <a href="big_business" title="wikilink">big business</a> may label environmental concerns as &quot;exaggerated&quot;, and often cause &quot;devastating damage&quot;, some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by <a href="national_park" title="wikilink">national parks</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to <a href="ecotourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecotourism</a>,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. <a href="Nature_preserve" title="wikilink">Nature preserves</a> are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 <a href="Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="wikilink">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> has resulted in international <a href="Biodiversity_Action_Plan" title="wikilink">Biodiversity Action Plan</a> programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.</p>
<p>People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction <a href="risk" title="wikilink">risks</a>. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with <a href="human_overpopulation" title="wikilink">human overpopulation</a> in tropical <a href="developing_country" title="wikilink">developing countries</a>, there has been enormous pressure on forests due to <a href="subsistence_agriculture" title="wikilink">subsistence agriculture</a>, including <a href="slash-and-burn" class="uri" title="wikilink">slash-and-burn</a> agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The American philosopher <a href="Michael_Levin" title="wikilink">Michael Levin</a> argues, &quot;The very fact that a species is near extinction implies that its final demise will have negligible impact.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Biologist <a href="Olivia_Judson" title="wikilink">Olivia Judson</a> has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain species. In a September 25, 2003 <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> article, she advocated &quot;<a href="genocide" title="wikilink">specicide</a>&quot; of thirty <a href="mosquito" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosquito</a> species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create <a href="recessive" class="uri" title="wikilink">recessive</a> &quot;<a href="Gene_knockout" title="wikilink">knockout genes</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> She says that the <em><a href="Anopheles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anopheles</a></em> mosquitoes (which spread <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a>) and <em><a href="Aedes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aedes</a></em> mosquitoes (which spread <a href="dengue_fever" title="wikilink">dengue fever</a>, <a href="yellow_fever" title="wikilink">yellow fever</a>, <a href="elephantiasis_tropica" title="wikilink">elephantiasis</a>, and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the <a href="genetic_diversity" title="wikilink">genetic diversity</a> of the <a href="Family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="Culicidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Culicidae</a> by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct &quot;all the time&quot; the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the <a href="ecosystem" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecosystem</a>: &quot;We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species &lt;U+2014&gt; but different need not mean worse.&quot; In addition, anti-malarial and <a href="Mosquito#Control" title="wikilink">mosquito control programs</a> offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in <a href="developing_nation" title="wikilink">developing nations</a> who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: &quot;We should consider the ultimate swatting.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cloning">Cloning</h3>

<p>Some, such as Harvard geneticist <a href="George_M._Church" title="wikilink">George M. Church</a> believe that ongoing technological advances will let us &quot;bring back to life&quot; an extinct species by <a href="Cloning#Cloning_extinct_and_endangered_species" title="wikilink">cloning</a>, using <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a> from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the <a href="mammoth" class="uri" title="wikilink">mammoth</a>, the <a href="thylacine" class="uri" title="wikilink">thylacine</a>, and the <a href="Pyrenean_ibex" title="wikilink">Pyrenean ibex</a>. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though <a href="bioethics" title="wikilink">bioethical</a> and <a href="philosophy" title="wikilink">philosophical</a> objections have been raised,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (<em>C. p. pyrenaica</em>). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and <a href="mountain_goat" title="wikilink">mountain goat</a>-<a href="Goat" title="wikilink">domestic goat</a> hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In fiction, the concept of cloning extinct species is thought to have been first popularized by the successful 1990 Michael Crichton novel and subsequent film <em><a href="Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="wikilink">Jurassic Park</a></em>, though the idea may have been first used in <a href="John_Brosnan" title="wikilink">John Brosnan</a>'s 1984 novel <em><a href="Carnosaur_(novel)" title="wikilink">Carnosaur</a></em>, then in <a href="F._Paul_Wilson" title="wikilink">F. Paul Wilson</a>'s 1989 novel <em>Dydeetown World</em>, and later in <a href="Piers_Anthony" title="wikilink">Piers Anthony</a>'s 1990 novel <em>Balook</em>, which featured the resurrection of a <em><a href="Baluchitherium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baluchitherium</a></em>, though <a href="Pat_Mills" title="wikilink">Pat Mills</a>' <a href="Judge_Dredd" title="wikilink">Judge Dredd</a> story &quot;<a href="The_Cursed_Earth_(Judge_Dredd_story)" title="wikilink">The Cursed Earth</a>&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; in which the titular lawman battles tyrannosaurs who live wild in post-apocalyptic America after they escape from the theme park where they have been cloned to be used as attractions - precedes these examples, published as it was in 1978.</p>
