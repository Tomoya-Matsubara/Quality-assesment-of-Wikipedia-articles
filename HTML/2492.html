<p><strong>Joppenbergh Mountain</strong> is a nearly {{#tag:ref|Sources differ on whether Joppenbergh is <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or . Both measurements give Joppenbergh a lower elevation than the highest point in the town of Rosendale, a  peak of the <a href="Shawangunk_Ridge" title="wikilink">Shawangunk Ridge</a>.|group=note|name=heightnote}} mountain in <a href="Rosendale_Village,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rosendale Village</a>, a <a href="Hamlet_(New_York)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> in the town of <a href="Rosendale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rosendale</a>, in <a href="Ulster_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ulster County</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>. The mountain was named after Rosendale's founder, Jacob Rutsen, and <a href="Mining" title="wikilink">mined</a> throughout the late 19th century for <a href="dolostone" class="uri" title="wikilink">dolostone</a> that was used in the manufacture of <a href="natural_cement" title="wikilink">natural cement</a>. Extensive mining caused a large cave-in on December 19, 1899, that destroyed equipment and collapsed <a href="Shaft_mining" title="wikilink">shafts</a> within Joppenbergh. Though it was feared that several workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all the miners were outside, eating lunch. Since the collapse, the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls.</p>
<p>During the late 1930s, Joppenbergh became the site of several <a href="ski_jumping" title="wikilink">ski jumping</a> competitions, which continued until the early 1940s. The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with <a href="borax" class="uri" title="wikilink">borax</a> for a summer competition. Several <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic</a> skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope was built on the mountain, and the revived competitions continued until 1971.</p>
<p>The town of Rosendale considered buying land near the mountain in 2003 for parking, and the following year, the town leased a tract of land to build a municipal parking lot. Joppenbergh was put up for sale in 2009, and in March 2011, the <a href="Open_Space_Institute" title="wikilink">Open Space Institute</a> offered to purchase the entire  property and sell it to the town. The Rosendale town board initially agreed to the deal the following month, with payment planned to come from a surplus fund. That June, however, the board found that the surplus fund had already been exhausted and could not cover the entire cost of the purchase. , the mountain's sale remains pending.</p>

<p>By late December 1899, mining had compromised Joppenbergh's integrity enough to cause a series of landslides, followed by a large <a href="cave-in" class="uri" title="wikilink">cave-in</a> on December 19.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8 AM, and culminating in the 11:30 AM collapse of the <em>Black Smoke Mine</em> shaft network.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, eating lunch.</p>

At the time of the collapse, the total cost of the damage was estimated to be between $20,000 and $25,000. Another, larger collapse happened the following week, late at night.

The Rosendale Township Association, founded in 1934 to encourage tourism in the town, sought out new activities to attract tourists to the town during the winter. In 1936 the association asked a <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>-based <a href="telemark_skiing" title="wikilink">telemark skiing</a> club to build its new  <a href="ski_jumping" title="wikilink">ski jumping</a> slope in Rosendale.

<p>Rosendale's first ski jumping competition<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> was held on January 24, 1937.

Three hundred shares of stock were issued for the JMC, priced at $100 per share, to build a new slopeand to buy the mountain itself for $20,000 from its owner, Mary Sammons. The JMC gained control of the property on August 20, 1964, and immediately announced its intent to build a new ski slope on the site of the original one, as well as a parking lot capable of holding 10,000 cars.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The goal of the club was to make Rosendale the &quot;Nordic Ski Capital of the East&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A new  slope was completed on November 14, 1965, and a ski jumping competition was held in January 1966. Skier Liet Bringslimark achieved a  jump from the new slope.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This record was broken by Per Coucheron, a 22-year-old <a href="Dartmouth_College" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a> student who reached  in a tournament on January 27, 1968.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The Rosendale Outing Ski Club organized a competition on January 25 and 26, 1969, attended by a crowd of 3,000 people. <a href="List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_Nordic_combined" title="wikilink">Olympic medalist</a> <a href="Franz_Keller" title="wikilink">Franz Keller</a> jumped  down a  slope on Joppenbergh, though he managed to reach  during practice.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> It had rained the week before the competition, and although 20 truckloads of snow were brought in, the condition of the track was &quot;extremely fast&quot;.

<p>In 1970 the Rosendale Outing Ski Club became part of the Rosendale Nordic Ski Club. The club organized Rosendale's final skiing competition, which took place on February 6 and 7, 1971. Keller's  record was broken twice on February 6, by <a href="Middlebury_College" title="wikilink">Middlebury College</a> student Hugh Barber.

<p>Periodic rockfalls continue to happen, with debris sliding down the mountain face. In 1984, <a href="New_York_State_Route_213" title="wikilink">State Route 213</a> was moved  away from Joppenbergh and closer to <a href="Rondout_Creek" title="wikilink">Rondout Creek</a> to protect motorists. A <a href="retaining_wall" title="wikilink">retaining wall</a> was put up at the foot of the mountain to prevent falling rocks from rolling onto the street.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> During the 1980s, Vidacable TV Systems leased part of the mountain from the JMC to set up an <a href="Radio_masts_and_towers" title="wikilink">antenna</a>. <a href="Cellular_One" title="wikilink">Cellular One</a> considered building a  <a href="Cell_site" title="wikilink">cell tower</a> on top of Joppenbergh in 1992, but decided not to do so.

The lot belonged to former village mayor Joseph Reid,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> who refused to sell it to the town. Although the town board considered using <a href="eminent_domain" title="wikilink">eminent domain</a> to acquire Reid's property,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> it agreed in June 2004 to lease the Joppenbergh property instead, for a period of 10 years,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> at a rate of $3,500 each year.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> One member of the town board opposed the deal because it would not secure the land beyond the 10-year term.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The lease allowed the town to create a park by the municipal lot,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Willow Kiln Park, which contains several defunct <a href="cement_kiln" title="wikilink">cement kilns</a>.

<p>Though the JMC had been unwilling to sell its land in 2004, by December 2009 the entire mountain was put up for sale, for $500,000.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Before 2009, the assessed value of the property was only about $50,000.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In early March 2011, the <a href="Open_Space_Institute" title="wikilink">Open Space Institute</a> (OSI) offered to purchase the  propertywhich had, by that time, been reassessed at $240,000<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>for $185,000, and sell it to the town for $85,000. The deal would create an <a href="easement" class="uri" title="wikilink">easement</a> with the town, allowing only noncommercial use of the mountain while preserving the municipal parking lot at its base.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> While some government officials viewed such an acquisition as a permanent solution to the hamlet's parking problems, other officials viewed the loss of tax revenue from the privately owned property to be undesirable.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was much less than the cost of renting part of it for parking.
