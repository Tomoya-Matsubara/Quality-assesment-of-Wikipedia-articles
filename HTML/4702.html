<p>&quot;<strong>Winter</strong>&quot; is a song by <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>. The track was originally planned to be included on the band's 2009 album <em><a href="No_Line_on_the_Horizon" title="wikilink">No Line on the Horizon</a></em>, but it was cut at the end of the recording sessions as it did not fit the album's theme. The song does appear on the accompanying film <em><a href="Linear_(film)" title="wikilink">Linear</a></em>. &quot;Winter&quot; was written for the 2009 war film <em><a href="Brothers_(2009_film)" title="wikilink">Brothers</a></em> at the request of director <a href="Jim_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Jim Sheridan</a>, and it plays over the closing credits. Several different versions of the song have been recorded, including an uptempo rock arrangement on <em>Linear</em> and a slower acoustic version in <em>Brothers</em>. The song was nominated for a <a href="Golden_Globe" title="wikilink">Golden Globe</a> award.</p>
<h2 id="writing-and-recording">Writing and recording</h2>
<p>&quot;Winter&quot; was written for the 2009 war film <em>Brothers</em> directed by <a href="Jim_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Jim Sheridan</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After telling the band about the script for the film, Sheridan asked them if they would write a song for it.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Guitarist <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">The Edge</a> began to compose a piece on piano that the band thought would fit the film. As the recording progressed, it became a &quot;conventional, straightforward arrangement&quot; which The Edge described as &quot;too close to the U2 sound and U2 form&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The track did not begin to come together until U2 viewed a rough cut of the film. The Edge noted &quot;it was really at that point that we really got inspired and the song started to come together quite quickly&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>With the help of <a href="Record_producer" title="wikilink">producer</a> <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a>, the band began to work on the song from a different angle, with the result being a more stripped-down version that echoed The Edge's original piano composition. The Edge stated that the piano &quot;seemed to be the key to making the song work... when we went back to that instrument, it seemed to lock in and start to make sense&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The original rock arrangement is the one in <em>Linear</em>, while the acoustic version is what appears in <em>Brothers</em>. In addition, an <a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic</a> version has also been developed.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Lead singer <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> wrote the lyrics in one night and they were revised just once after that.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Tobey_Maguire" title="wikilink">Tobey Maguire</a>'s character Captain Sam Cahill was the inspiration for the lyric, with the band noting that the focus on &quot;intense hidden emotion&quot; and the secrets he held inside &quot;was a jumping off point, thematically.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Bono noted that Sheridan wanted a &quot;complex song for a complex character&quot; and so the band wrote two songs: &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;<a href="White_as_Snow_(song)" title="wikilink">White as Snow</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> While &quot;White as Snow&quot; focuses more on the relationship between the Cahill brothers, &quot;Winter&quot; is a &quot;more universal song about the experience of the armed forces in Afghanistan.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>U2 wanted to include &quot;Winter&quot; on the album <em>No Line on the Horizon</em>, as well as on <em>Brothers</em>, but this ultimately did not happen; The Edge noted that &quot;though it's a beautiful tune, it doesn't quite fit on our record thematically&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The song was cut in the final days of recording.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <em>Brothers</em> was planned to be released before <em>No Line on the Horizon</em>, but the timing made it difficult to complete the song in time, and the band offered Sheridan the use of &quot;White as Snow&quot; instead.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The eventual delay in the release of <em>Brothers</em> gave the band enough time to complete &quot;Winter&quot; and it was used in the film's closing credits.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The band later noted that it was a better selection for the film than &quot;White as Snow&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
<p><em><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q</a></em> described the rockier <em>Linear</em> version as being &quot;surrounded by a deceptively simple rhythm track and an evocative string arrangement courtesy of Eno.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="appearances-in-other-media">Appearances in other media</h2>
<p>&quot;Winter&quot; appears as the third track in the <a href="Anton_Corbijn" title="wikilink">Anton Corbijn</a> film <em><a href="Linear_(film)" title="wikilink">Linear</a></em>, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a <a href="Paris" title="wikilink">Parisian</a> traffic cop travels across France and the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Sea</a> to visit his girlfriend in <a href="Tripoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tripoli</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> During the sequence, the cop, played by <a href="Sa&lt;U+00EF&gt;d_Taghmaoui" title="wikilink">Sa&lt;U+00EF&gt;d Taghmaoui</a>, leaves Paris and begins his journey across the French and Spanish countryside. It ends with him pulling off the road for a rest where the next track, &quot;White as Snow&quot;, begins.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>&quot;Winter&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Original Song&quot; at the <a href="67th_Golden_Globe_Awards" title="wikilink">67th Golden Globe Awards</a> for its role in <em>Brothers</em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In a preview of <em>No Line on the Horizon</em>, <em><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q</a></em> called the <em>Linear</em> version one of the &quot;instantly striking tracks&quot; while describing Bono's &quot;lyric about a soldier in an unspecified war zone&quot; as &quot;fine&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> reviewer Brian Hiatt called it a &quot;lovely discarded ballad&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> had a negative impression of the <em>Brothers</em> version, labelling it &quot;a snails-paced somber number with some oh-so-serious, look-at-me flashes of rhythm&quot; while noting that it &quot;could have used some of the gospel atmospheres of the act's 2009 effort <em>{{'}}No Line on the Horizon{{'}}</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
