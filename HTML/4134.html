The young Octavius was adopted by his great uncle, <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a> and came into his inheritance after Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. In 43 BC, Octavian joined forces with <a href="Mark_Antony" title="wikilink">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir)" title="wikilink">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a> in a <a href="military_dictatorship" title="wikilink">military dictatorship</a> known as the <a href="Second_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">Second Triumvirate</a>. As a Triumvir, Octavian effectually ruled Rome and most of its provinces<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> as an autocrat, seizing consular power after the deaths of the consuls <a href="Aulus_Hirtius" title="wikilink">Hirtius</a> and <a href="Gaius_Vibius_Pansa_Caetronianus" title="wikilink">Pansa</a> and having himself perpetually re-elected. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its rulers: Lepidus was driven into exile, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Actium" title="wikilink">Battle of Actium</a> by the armies of Octavian in 31 BC.</p>
<p>After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Octavian restored the outward facade of the <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a>, with governmental power vested in the <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Roman Senate</a>, but in practice retained his autocratic power. It took several years to work out the exact framework by which a formally republican state could be led by a sole ruler, the result of which became known as the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>. The emperorship was never an office like the <a href="Roman_dictator" title="wikilink">Roman dictatorship</a> which Caesar and <a href="Sulla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sulla</a> had held before him; indeed, he declined it when the Roman populace &quot;entreated him to take on the dictatorship&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including those of <a href="tribune" class="uri" title="wikilink">tribune</a> of the plebs and <a href="Roman_censor" title="wikilink">censor</a>. He was <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consul</a> until 23 BC. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His substantive power stemmed from financial success and resources gained in conquest, the building of patronage relationships throughout the Empire, the loyalty of many military soldiers and veterans, the authority of the many honors granted by the Senate,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the respect of the people. Augustus' control over the majority of Rome's <a href="legion" title="wikilink">legions</a> established an armed threat that could be used against the Senate, allowing him to coerce the Senate's decisions. With his ability to eliminate senatorial opposition by means of arms, the Senate became docile towards his paramount position of leadership.</p>
<p>The rule of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the <em><a href="Pax_Romana" title="wikilink">Pax Romana</a></em>, or <em>Roman peace</em>. Despite continuous frontier wars, and one <a href="Year_of_Four_Emperors" title="wikilink">year-long civil war</a> over the imperial succession, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries. Augustus expanded the boundaries of the Roman Empire, secured the Empire's borders with <a href="client_state" title="wikilink">client states</a>, and made peace with <a href="Parthia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthia</a> through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed <a href="Roman_road" title="wikilink">networks of roads</a> with an official <a href="courier" class="uri" title="wikilink">courier</a> system, established a standing army (and a small navy), established the <a href="Praetorian_Guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian Guard</a>, and created official police and fire-fighting forces for Rome. Much of the city was rebuilt under Augustus; and he wrote a record of his own accomplishments, known as the <em><a href="Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti" title="wikilink">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a></em>, which has survived. Upon his death in AD 14, Augustus was declared a god by the Senate, to be worshipped by the Romans.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His names Augustus and Caesar were adopted by every subsequent emperor, and the month of <a href="Sextilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sextilis</a> was officially renamed <a href="August" class="uri" title="wikilink">August</a> in his honour. He was succeeded by his stepson <a href="Tiberius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiberius</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>


<p>While his paternal family was from the town of <a href="Velitrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Velitrae</a>, about 25 miles from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on <a href="September_23" title="wikilink">September 23</a>, 63 BC. He was born at Ox Heads, which was a small property on the Palatine Hill, very close to the <a href="Roman_Forum" title="wikilink">Roman Forum</a>. An astrologer had given a warning to his father. However, his father decided to keep the child despite the warning (rather than leave the child in the open to be eaten by dogs). He was given the name <strong>Gaius Octavius</strong>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavian (at this point he was simply called Gaius) was taken to his father's home village at <a href="Velitrae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Velitrae</a> to be raised.</p>
<p>Octavian only mentions his father's <a href="equestrian_(Roman)" title="wikilink">equestrian</a> family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather was a military tribune in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> during the <a href="Second_Punic_War" title="wikilink">Second Punic War</a>. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. <a href="Gaius_Octavius" title="wikilink">His father, also named Gaius Octavius</a>, had been governor of <a href="Macedonia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Shortly after Octavius' birth, his father gave him the <a href="cognomen" class="uri" title="wikilink">cognomen</a> of <strong>Thurinus</strong>, possibly to commemorate his victory at <a href="Thurii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thurii</a> over a rebellious band of slaves.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> His mother <a href="Atia_Balba_Caesonia" title="wikilink">Atia</a> was the niece of <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a>.</p>
<p>Since Octavius' father was a <a href="plebeian" class="uri" title="wikilink">plebeian</a>, Octavius himself was a plebeian, despite the fact that his mother, being Julius Caesar's niece, was a <a href="patrician" class="uri" title="wikilink">patrician</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Octavius gained patrician status when he was adopted by <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a> in <a href="44_BC" title="wikilink">44 BC</a>.</p>
<p>In 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His mother married a former governor of Syria, <a href="Lucius_Marcius_Philippus" title="wikilink">Lucius Marcius Philippus</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Philippus claimed descent from <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, and was elected <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consul</a> in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother (and Julius Caesar's sister), <a href="Julia_Caesaris_(sister_of_Julius_Caesar)" title="wikilink">Julia Caesaris</a>.</p>
<p>In 52 or 51 BC, Julia Caesaris died. Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the <em><a href="toga_virilis" title="wikilink">toga virilis</a></em> four years later,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and was elected to the <a href="College_of_Pontiffs" title="wikilink">College of Pontiffs</a> in 47 BC.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The following year he was put in charge of the <a href="Games" title="wikilink">Greek games</a> that were staged in honor of the <a href="Temple_of_Venus_Genetrix" title="wikilink">Temple of Venus Genetrix</a>, built by Julius Caesar.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> According to <a href="Nicolaus_of_Damascus" title="wikilink">Nicolaus of Damascus</a>, Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in <a href="Africa_(province)" title="wikilink">Africa</a> but gave way when Atia protested.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in <a href="Hispania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispania</a>, where he planned to fight the forces of <a href="Pompey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompey</a>, Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.</p>
<p>When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he made it across hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus" title="wikilink">Velleius Paterculus</a> reports that Caesar afterwards allowed the young man to share his carriage.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the <a href="Vestal_Virgins" title="wikilink">Vestal Virgins</a>, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in <a href="Macedonia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, he sailed to <a href="Italia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Italia</a> to ascertain if he had any potential political fortunes or security.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After landing at Lupiae near <a href="Brundisium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brundisium</a>, he learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Having no living legitimate children,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Caesar had adopted his great-nephew Octavius as his son and main heir.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Owing to his <a href="adoption_in_Rome" title="wikilink">adoption</a>, Octavius assumed the name <em>Gaius Julius Caesar</em>.

<p>In 27 BC, Octavian formally returned full power to the <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Roman Senate</a> and relinquished his control of the Roman provinces and their armies.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> However, under the consulship of Octavian, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing <a href="Bill_(proposed_law)" title="wikilink">bills</a> for senatorial debate.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Although Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power in the Roman Republic was unrivaled.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> The historian Werner Eck states of Augustus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire. All of them taken together formed the basis of his <em>auctoritas</em>, which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>

<p>To a large extent, the public was aware of the vast financial resources Augustus commanded.

<p>The Senate proposed to Octavian, the cherished victor of Rome's civil wars, to once again assume command of the provinces. The senate proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power.

<p>Augustus was granted the right to hang the <em><a href="corona_civica" title="wikilink">corona civica</a></em>, the &quot;civic crown&quot; made from oak, above his door and have laurels drape his doorposts.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a <a href="Roman_triumph" title="wikilink">triumph</a>, with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat &quot;<em><a href="memento_mori" title="wikilink">memento mori</a></em>&quot;, or, &quot;Remember, you are mortal&quot;, to the triumphant general. Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital.

<p>Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class.

<p>Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often, to display humility, newly-appointed Emperors would often decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had actually been granted them by the Senate. The civic crown, which later Emperors took to actually wearing, consular insignia, and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general (<em><a href="toga_picta" title="wikilink">toga picta</a></em>) became the imperial insignia well into the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> era.</p>

<p>The illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> If someone was to succeed his unofficial position of power, they were going to have to earn it through their own publicly-known merits.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus_(Julio-Claudian_dynasty)" title="wikilink">Marcellus</a>, who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter <a href="Julia_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Julia the Elder</a>.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC,<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> instead indicating a preference for <a href="Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa" title="wikilink">Marcus Agrippa</a>, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: <a href="Gaius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Gaius Caesar</a>, <a href="Lucius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Lucius Caesar</a>, <a href="Vipsania_Julia" title="wikilink">Vipsania Julia</a>, <a href="Agrippina_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Agrippina the Elder</a>, and <a href="Agrippa_Postumus" title="wikilink">Postumus Agrippa</a>, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the <em>imperium</em> of a proconsul and the same <em>tribunicia potestas</em> granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at <a href="Samos_Island" title="wikilink">Samos</a> in the <a href="Cyclades" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyclades</a>.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a><a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> Although this granting of power would have shown Augustus' favor for Agrippa, it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustus' intent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs was apparent when he adopted them as his own children, and personally ushered them into their political careers by serving as consul with each in 5 and 2 BC.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage, <a href="Nero_Claudius_Drusus_Germanicus" title="wikilink">Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus</a> and <a href="Tiberius" title="wikilink">Tiberius Claudius</a>, granting them military commands and public office, and seeming to favor Drusus.

<h2 id="augustus-legacy">Augustus' legacy</h2>
<p><img src="Statue-Augustus.jpg" title="fig:The famous Augustus of Prima Porta" alt="The famous Augustus of Prima Porta" width="220" />  Augustus' reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted hundreds of years until the ultimate <a href="decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">decline of the Roman Empire</a>. Both his borrowed surname, Caesar, and his title <em>Augustus</em> became the permanent titles of the rulers of <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a> for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at <a href="Rome" title="wikilink">Old Rome</a> and <a href="Constantinople" title="wikilink">New Rome</a>. In many languages, <em>caesar</em> became the word for <em>emperor</em>, as in the German <em><a href="Kaiser" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiser</a></em> and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian <em><a href="Tsar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tsar</a></em>.

He had composed an account of his achievements, the <em><a href="Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti" title="wikilink">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a></em>, to be inscribed in bronze in front of <a href="Mausoleum_of_Augustus" title="wikilink">his mausoleum</a>.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a> Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a> The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in <a href="Ankara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ankara</a> dubbed the <em>Monumentum Ancyranum</em>, called the &quot;queen of inscriptions&quot; by historian <a href="Theodor_Mommsen" title="wikilink">Theodor Mommsen</a>.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a> There are a few known written works by Augustus that have not survived.

<p>Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated <em>Pax Romana</em> or <em>Pax Augusta</em>. He was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a>, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized <a href="History_of_criminal_justice" title="wikilink">police force</a>, <a href="fire_fighting" title="wikilink">fire fighting</a> force, and the establishment of the municipal <a href="prefect" class="uri" title="wikilink">prefect</a> as a permanent office.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a> The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a> A <em>praefectus vigilum</em>, or &quot;Prefect of the Watch&quot; was put in charge of the <a href="vigiles" class="uri" title="wikilink">vigiles</a>, Rome's fire brigade and police.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a> With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a <a href="standing_army" title="wikilink">standing army</a> for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a> This was supported by numerous <a href="auxiliary" class="uri" title="wikilink">auxiliary</a> units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official <a href="courier" class="uri" title="wikilink">courier</a> system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the <em>praefectus vehiculorum</em>.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311"><sup>311</sup></a> Besides the advent of swifter communication amongst Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a> In the year 6 Augustus established the <em>aerarium militare</em>, donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> One of the most lasting institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the <a href="Praetorian_Guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian Guard</a> in 27 BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was <a href="Maxentius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maxentius</a>, as it was <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine I</a> who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the <a href="Castra_Praetoria" title="wikilink">Castra Praetoria</a>.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a></p>

He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus paid 400 <a href="sestertius" title="wikilink">sesterces</a> each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the <a href="Roman_mythology" title="wikilink">Roman pantheon</a> of deities.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<p>The longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a> wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>
<p>The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist <a href="Marcus_Antistius_Labeo" title="wikilink">Marcus Antistius Labeo</a> (d. 10 or 11 AD), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican <a href="liberty" class="uri" title="wikilink">liberty</a> in which he had been born into, openly criticized the Augustan regime.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> In the beginning of his <em><a href="Annals_(Tacitus)" title="wikilink">Annals</a></em>, the Roman historian <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a> (c. 56â€“c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> However, Tacitus was of the belief that <a href="Nerva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nerva</a> (r. 96â€“98) successfully &quot;mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty.&quot;<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> The 3rd century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an <a href="autocrat" class="uri" title="wikilink">autocrat</a>.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> The poet <a href="Marcus_Annaeus_Lucanus" title="wikilink">Marcus Annaeus Lucanus</a> (39â€“65 AD) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of <a href="Cato_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Cato the Younger</a> (95 BCâ€“46 BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, &quot;perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.&quot;<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Anglo-Irish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish</a> writer <a href="Jonathan_Swift" title="wikilink">Jonathan Swift</a> (1667â€“1745), in his <em>Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome</em>, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>'s virtuous <a href="constitutional_monarchy" title="wikilink">constitutional monarchy</a> to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian <a href="Thomas_Gordon_(Royal_Scots_Navy_officer)" title="wikilink">Thomas Gordon</a> (1658â€“1741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant <a href="Oliver_Cromwell" title="wikilink">Oliver Cromwell</a> (1599â€“1658).<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> Thomas Gordon and the <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> political philosopher <a href="Charles_de_Secondat,_baron_de_Montesquieu" title="wikilink">Montesquieu</a> (1689â€“1755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> In his <em>Memoirs of the Court of Augustus</em>, the <a href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> scholar <a href="Thomas_Blackwell" title="wikilink">Thomas Blackwell</a> (1701â€“1757) deemed Augustus a <a href="Machiavellianism" title="wikilink">Machiavellian ruler</a>, &quot;a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper&quot;, &quot;wicked and worthless&quot;, &quot;a mean spirit&quot;, and a &quot;tyrant&quot;.<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a></p>

<p>Augustus' public <a href="revenue" class="uri" title="wikilink">revenue</a> reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population <a href="census" class="uri" title="wikilink">census</a>, with fixed quotas for each province.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a></p>
<p>An equally important reform was the abolition of private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the Republican era, and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in Rome.<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> Rome's revenue was the amount of the successful bids, and the tax farmers' profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers, widely (and accurately) perceived as unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.</p>
<p>The use of <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;gyptus" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>'s immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming <a href="Praetorian_prefect" title="wikilink">Prefect of the Praetorian Guard</a>.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> as well as bread and circuses for the population of Rome.</p>
<h3 id="month-of-august">Month of August</h3>
<p>The month of <a href="August" class="uri" title="wikilink">August</a> (Latin: <em>Augustus</em>) is named after Augustus; until his time it was called <a href="Sextilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sextilis</a> (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original <a href="Roman_calendar" title="wikilink">Roman calendar</a> and the Latin word for six was <em>sex</em>). Commonly-repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a>'s July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar <a href="Johannes_de_Sacrobosco" title="wikilink">Johannes de Sacrobosco</a>. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see <a href="Julian_calendar" title="wikilink">Julian calendar</a>). According to a <em>senatus consultum</em> quoted by <a href="Ambrosius_Theodosius_Macrobius" title="wikilink">Macrobius</a>, Sextilis was renamed to honour Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, fell in that month.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a></p>
