<p><strong>Klaus Riedel</strong> (<a href="August_2" title="wikilink">August 2</a> <a href="1907" class="uri" title="wikilink">1907</a> - <a href="August_4" title="wikilink">August 4</a> <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>) was a <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="rocket" class="uri" title="wikilink">rocket</a> pioneer. He was involved in many early liquid-fuelled rocket experiments, and eventually worked on the <a href="V-2_missile" title="wikilink">V-2 missile</a> programme at <a href="Peenem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peenem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde</a>.</p>
<p>Riedel was born in <a href="Wilhelmshaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wilhelmshaven</a>, the son of a naval officer. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and his father two years later. The orphaned Klaus was raised by his grandmother in <a href="Bernstadt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bernstadt</a>. He went on to study as a machinist at the Technical College of <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> and to work at <a href="L&lt;U+00F6&gt;we" class="uri" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00F6&gt;we</a>. While in Berlin, he attended a public lecture on rocketry by <a href="Rudolf_Nebel" title="wikilink">Rudolf Nebel</a> on behalf of Germany's amateur rocket group, the <em><a href="Verein_f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r_Raumschiffahrt" title="wikilink">Verein f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Raumschiffahrt</a></em> (VfR - &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;) and joined the group straight away, becoming very active in its efforts to build a working rocket that resulted in the <a href="Mirak_rocket" title="wikilink">Mirak</a> and <a href="Repulsor_rocket" title="wikilink">Repulsor rockets</a>, providing his family's farm as a testing ground.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>After the VfR disbanded in 1933, Riedel was invited by <a href="Wernher_von_Braun" title="wikilink">Wernher von Braun</a> to join him in the army's rocket programme. He accepted, and worked from Peenem&lt;U+00FC&gt;nde when the team moved there. Riedel's position was &quot;Head of the Test Laboratory&quot; and his work seems to have been mostly concerned with developing the mobile support equipment for the V-2.</p>
<p>He was killed in a car accident two days after his thirty-seventh birthday.</p>
<p>There is a memorial and small museum dedicated to him in Bernstadt and in <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a> a crater on the moon was named after him.</p>
