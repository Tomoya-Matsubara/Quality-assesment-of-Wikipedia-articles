<li><a href="1937" class="uri" title="wikilink">1937</a>: Brothers <a href="Dick_and_Mac_McDonald" title="wikilink">Dick and Mac McDonald</a> open a <a href="hot_dog" title="wikilink">hot dog</a> stand called the Airdrome in <a href="Arcadia,_California" title="wikilink">Arcadia, California</a>.</li>
<li><a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>: The brothers move the Airdome building to <a href="San_Bernardino,_California" title="wikilink">San Bernardino, California</a>, where they open the first McDonald's restaurant, on <a href="Route_66" title="wikilink">Route 66</a>, at 14th and E St., on <a href="May_15" title="wikilink">May 15</a>. Its menu consists of 25 items, mostly <a href="barbecue" class="uri" title="wikilink">barbecue</a>. As is common at the time, they employ around 20 <a href="carhop" title="wikilink">carhops</a>. It becomes a popular and highly profitable teen hangout.</li>
<li><a href="1948" class="uri" title="wikilink">1948</a>: After noting that almost all of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers close down the restaurant for several months to implement their innovative &quot;Speedee Service System&quot;, a streamlined <a href="assembly_line" title="wikilink">assembly line</a> for hamburgers. The carhops are fired, and when the restaurant reopens it sells only hamburgers, <a href="milkshake" title="wikilink">milkshakes</a>, and <a href="french_fries" title="wikilink">french fries</a>. At 15 cents, the burgers are about half as expensive as at standard diners, and they are served immediately. The restaurant is extremely successful, and its fame spreads by <a href="word_of_mouth" title="wikilink">word of mouth</a>.</li>
<li><a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>: The McDonald brothers begin to franchise their restaurant, with Neil Fox as the first franchisee. The second McDonald's opens in <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. It is the first to feature the <a href="Golden_Arches" title="wikilink">Golden Arches</a> design; later in the year the original restaurant is rebuilt in this style.</li>
<li><a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>: Third McDonald's restaurant opened in <a href="Saginaw,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Saginaw, Michigan</a> at the corner of State Street and Center Road, it was rebuilt in 2006 but has stayed at that location since opening.</li>
<li><a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>: Fourth McDonald's restaurant opens, in <a href="Downey,_California" title="wikilink">Downey, California</a> at the corner of Lakewood and Florence Avenue, and is the oldest McDonald's restaurant still in operation.</li>
<li><a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>: <a href="Entrepreneur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Entrepreneur</a> and <a href="milkshake" class="uri" title="wikilink">milkshake</a>-mixer salesman <a href="Ray_Kroc" title="wikilink">Ray Kroc</a> becomes fascinated by the McDonald's restaurant during a sales visit, when he learns of its extraordinary capacity and popularity. Others who had visited the restaurant and come away inspired were <a href="James_McLamore" title="wikilink">James McLamore</a>, founder of <a href="Burger_King" title="wikilink">Burger King</a>, and <a href="Glen_Bell" title="wikilink">Glen Bell</a>, founder of <a href="Taco_Bell" title="wikilink">Taco Bell</a>. After seeing the restaurant in operation, Kroc approaches the McDonald brothers, who have already begun franchising, with a proposition to let him franchise McDonald's restaurants outside the company's homebase of California and Arizona, with himself as the first franchisee. Kroc works hard to sell McDonald's. He even attempts to prevail on his wartime acquaintance with <a href="Walt_Disney" title="wikilink">Walt Disney</a>, in the failed hope of opening a McDonald's at the soon-to-be-opened <a href="Disneyland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disneyland</a>.</li>
<li><a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>: Ray Kroc founds &quot;McDonald's Systems, Inc.&quot; on <a href="March_2" title="wikilink">March 2</a>, as a legal structure for his planned franchises. Kroc opens the ninth McDonald's restaurant in <a href="Des_Plaines,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Des Plaines, Illinois</a>, in suburban <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> on <a href="April_15" title="wikilink">April 15</a>. The first day's revenues are $366.12. The company's literature usually refers to this date as the &quot;beginning&quot; of the company, then already 15 years old, writing the McDonald brothers out of its history in favor of &quot;Founder&quot; Kroc. The company still refers to this restaurant as &quot;McDonald's #1&quot;. In July, Ray Kroc opens his second McDonald's restaurant in <a href="Fresno,_California" title="wikilink">Fresno, California</a>, operated by Art Bender, Kroc's first subfranchisee. The Fresno site is referred to as &quot;first McDonald's restaurant franchised by Ray Kroc&quot; on a plaque on the site, which has been rebuilt to resemble the 1950s-style restaurants.</li>
<li><a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>: Ray Kroc hires <a href="Harry_J._Sonneborn" title="wikilink">Harry J. Sonneborn</a> as his <a href="Chief_Financial_Officer" title="wikilink">Chief Financial Officer</a>. Sonneborn remained a key influence in the McDonald's corporation till his resignation in <a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>.</li>
<li><a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>: Ray Kroc hires Fred Turner as a grillman in his store in Des Plaines.</li>
<li><a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a>: McDonalds worldwide sold its 100 millionth hamburger.</li>
<li><a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>: Kroc's company is renamed &quot;McDonald's Corporation&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a>: The McDonald brothers agree to sell Kroc business rights to their operation for $2.7 million, a sum that Kroc borrows from a number of investors, including <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>; Kroc considers the sum extreme, and it strains his relationship with the brothers. The agreement allows the brothers to keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald's franchise. Renamed &quot;The Big M&quot;, Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald's just one block north; he attends the opening. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain's annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today.</li>
<li><a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a>: <a href="Hamburger_University" title="wikilink">Hamburger University</a> opens in the basement of the Elk Grove Village, Illinois, McDonald's restaurant Bachelor of Hamburgology degrees went to graduating class of 15.</li>
<li><a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>: One of Kroc's marketing insights is his decision to market McDonald's hamburgers to families and children. <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation) sponsor a children's show on <a href="WRC-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">WRC-TV</a> called <em><a href="Bozo_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Bozo the Clown</a></em>, a franchised character played in Washington, D.C. by <a href="Willard_Scott" title="wikilink">Willard Scott</a> from <a href="1959" class="uri" title="wikilink">1959</a> until <a href="1962" class="uri" title="wikilink">1962</a>. After the show was cancelled, Goldstein hires Scott to portray McDonald's new mascot, named <a href="Ronald_McDonald" title="wikilink">Ronald McDonald</a>. According to Scott, they wanted to pay him in stock, but Scott decided to take the money. Scott, looking nothing like the familiar appearance of any <a href="McDonaldland" class="uri" title="wikilink">McDonaldland</a> character as is known today, appeared in the first three television advertisements featuring the character. After changing the character's first name to &quot;Ronald&quot; and replacing Scott with a new actor, and giving him the more familiar red, white, and yellow clown features, the character eventually spreads to the rest of the country via an advertising campaign. Years later, an entire cast of &quot;McDonaldland&quot; characters is developed.</li>
<li><a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>: The <a href="Filet-O-Fish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Filet-O-Fish</a> is introduced in <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, in a restaurant located in a neighborhood dominated by <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a> who practiced <a href="abstinence" class="uri" title="wikilink">abstinence</a> (the avoidance of meat) on Fridays. It is the first new addition to the original menu, and goes national the following year, with fish supplied by <a href="Gorton&#39;s_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Gorton's of Gloucester</a>. <em>See also <a href="Lou_Groen" title="wikilink">Lou Groen</a></em></li>

<li><a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>: The chain's stand-alone restaurant design which is still most common today, with <a href="mansard_roof" title="wikilink">mansard roof</a> and indoor seating, is introduced.</li>

<li><a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>: Having changed hands in <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>, the original &quot;Big M&quot; restaurant closes. It is demolished two years later, with only part of the sign remaining; this has since been restored.</li>
