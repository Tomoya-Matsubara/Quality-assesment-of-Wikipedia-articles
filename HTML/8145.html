<p><strong>Velvet Revolver</strong> is an American <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> <a href="Supergroup_(music)" title="wikilink">supergroup</a> consisting of former <a href="Guns_N&#39;_Roses" title="wikilink">Guns N' Roses</a> members <a href="Slash_(musician)" title="wikilink">Slash</a>, <a href="Duff_McKagan" title="wikilink">Duff McKagan</a> and <a href="Matt_Sorum" title="wikilink">Matt Sorum</a>, alongside <a href="Dave_Kushner" title="wikilink">Dave Kushner</a>, formerly of <a href="Hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">punk</a> band <a href="Wasted_Youth_(American_band)" title="wikilink">Wasted Youth</a>. <a href="Stone_Temple_Pilots" title="wikilink">Stone Temple Pilots</a> vocalist <a href="Scott_Weiland" title="wikilink">Scott Weiland</a> was Velvet Revolver's lead singer from their formation until 2008. In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, <em><a href="Contraband_(Velvet_Revolver_album)" title="wikilink">Contraband</a></em>. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, criticizing them for a &quot;disconnection&quot; between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single &quot;<a href="Slither_(song)" title="wikilink">Slither</a>&quot;, they won the 2005 <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance" title="wikilink">Best Hard Rock Performance</a>.</p>
<p>The band released <em><a href="Libertad_(Velvet_Revolver_album)" title="wikilink">Libertad</a></em> in 2007, driven by the release of the single &quot;<a href="She_Builds_Quick_Machines" title="wikilink">She Builds Quick Machines</a>&quot;, and embarked on a tour with <a href="Alice_in_Chains" title="wikilink">Alice in Chains</a>. In April 2008, Weiland left Velvet Revolver and <a href="2008_Stone_Temple_Pilots_Reunion_Tour" title="wikilink">reunited with Stone Temple Pilots</a>. Velvet Revolver has been on indefinite hiatus since April 2008, and in November of that year, the band was released by their record label <a href="RCA_Records" title="wikilink">RCA Records</a> at their request to allow them &quot;complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish&quot; replacing Weiland.</p>
<p>The release of Slash's <a href="Slash_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled debut solo album</a> and Duff McKagan's addition to the <a href="Jane&#39;s_Addiction" title="wikilink">Jane's Addiction</a> lineup seemed to put the future of the band in doubt. However, McKagan left Jane's Addiction a few months after joining. Despite being on hiatus, Velvet Revolver has written new songs and plans to audition singers and reconvene in 2011.</p>

Slash and McKagan had been members since 1985, while Sorum joined the band in 1990.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Guns N' Roses toured and achieved international success following the release of the albums <em><a href="Appetite_for_Destruction" title="wikilink">Appetite for Destruction</a></em>, <em><a href="Use_Your_Illusion_I" title="wikilink">Use Your Illusion I</a></em>, and <em><a href="Use_Your_Illusion_II" title="wikilink">Use Your Illusion II</a></em>. However, a distancing relationship with singer <a href="Axl_Rose" title="wikilink">Axl Rose</a> resulted in Slash, in 1996, and McKagan, in 1997, leaving the band while Sorum was fired the same year.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Following their departures, the trio focused on separate projects with Slash reforming <a href="Slash&#39;s_Snakepit" title="wikilink">Slash's Snakepit</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and McKagan reforming <a href="10_Minute_Warning" title="wikilink">10 Minute Warning</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> as well as recording his second solo album<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> while Sorum rejoined <a href="The_Cult" title="wikilink">The Cult</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>When musician <a href="Randy_Castillo" title="wikilink">Randy Castillo</a> died from cancer in 2002, Slash, McKagan, and Sorum performed at a benefit concert to raise money and commemorate Castillo<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> with <a href="Josh_Todd" title="wikilink">Josh Todd</a> and Keith Nelson of <a href="Buckcherry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buckcherry</a> as well as <a href="B-Real" class="uri" title="wikilink">B-Real</a> and <a href="Sen_Dog" title="wikilink">Sen Dog</a> of <a href="Cypress_Hill" title="wikilink">Cypress Hill</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the trio began rehearsing with Todd<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and Nelson, working on material that would become &quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> but eventually decided against forming a group with them.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> During a Loaded show at Hollywood's <a href="Viper_Room" title="wikilink">Viper Room</a>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in junior high and high school.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that &quot;Dave brought a cool vibe to what [they] were doing.
