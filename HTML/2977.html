<p><strong>Eldad ha-Dani</strong> or <strong>Eldad HaDani</strong> or <strong>Eldad ben Mahli ha-Dani</strong> () was a Jewish, Hebrew-writing merchant and traveler of the ninth century. He professed to be a citizen of an &quot;independent <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> state&quot; in eastern <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>, probably in the <a href="Gihon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gihon</a> region, inhabited by people claiming descent from the tribes of <a href="Tribe_of_Dan" title="wikilink">Dan</a> (hence his name, &quot;ha-Dani&quot; = &quot;the Danite&quot;), <a href="Tribe_of_Asher" title="wikilink">Asher</a>, <a href="Tribe_of_Gad" title="wikilink">Gad</a>, and <a href="Tribe_of_Naphtali" title="wikilink">Naphtali</a>. Starting from this state, Eldad visited <a href="Babylonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babylonia</a>, <a href="Kairouan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kairouan</a>, and <a href="Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberia</a>, causing everywhere a great stir among the Jews by his fanciful accounts of the <a href="Ten_Lost_Tribes" title="wikilink">Ten Lost Tribes</a>, and by the <em><a href="halakha" title="wikilink">halakhot</a></em> which he claimed he had brought from his native country. These <em>halakhot</em>, written in <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>, deal with the slaughtering and subsequent examination of animals (see <a href="Kosher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kosher</a>). They differ in many places from the <a href="Talmud" title="wikilink">Talmudic</a> ordinances, and are introduced in the name of <a href="Joshua" title="wikilink">Joshua ben Nun</a>, or, according to another version, of <a href="Othniel_Ben_Kenaz" title="wikilink">Othniel Ben Kenaz</a>. Eldad's accounts soon spread, and, as usual in such cases, were remolded and amplified by copyists and editors. There are no fewer than eight versions with important variations. The following is a summary of Eldad's narrative according to the most complete of these versions:</p>
<h2 id="his-travels">His travels</h2>
<p>On leaving the land &quot;on the other side of the river of <a href="Kingdom_of_Kush" title="wikilink">Kush</a> (probably the <a href="Nile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nile</a>),&quot; Eldad traveled with a man of the tribe of Asher. A great storm wrecked the boat, but God prepared a plank for him and his companion, on which they floated until thrown ashore among a <a href="cannibal" class="uri" title="wikilink">cannibal</a> <a href="Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Ethiopian</a> tribe called <em>Romrom</em>. (As to the existence in former times of such a tribe, see Metz in &quot;Das J&lt;U+00FC&gt;dische Litteraturblatt,&quot; 1877, No. 41.) The Asherite, who was fat, was immediately eaten, while Eldad was put into a pit to fatten. Soon after a <a href="fire-worship" title="wikilink">fire-worshiping</a> tribe assailed the cannibals, and Eldad was taken prisoner. He remained in captivity for four years. His captors brought him to the province of <a href="Azania" title="wikilink">Azanian</a> (according to another version, to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>), where he was ransomed by a Jewish merchant for thirty-two pieces of <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a>. Eldad continued his journey, and fell in with the tribe of <a href="Issachar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Issachar</a>, dwelling among high mountains near <a href="Medes" title="wikilink">Media</a> and <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persia</a>, their land extending ten days' journey on every side. &quot;They are at peace with all, and their whole energy is devoted to the study of the Law; their only weapon is the knife for slaughtering animals.&quot; Their judge and prince is called <em>Nahshon</em> and they use the four methods of capital punishment. The tribe of Zebulon occupies the land extending from the province of Armenia to the River Euphrates. Behind the mountains of Paran the tribe of Reuben faces them. Peace reigns between these two tribes; they war as allies and divide the spoils. They possess the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, the <a href="Mishnah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mishnah</a>, the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a>, and the <a href="Haggadah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haggadah</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Tribe_of_Ephraim" title="wikilink">Tribe of Ephraim</a> and half of the <a href="Tribe_of_Manasseh" title="wikilink">Tribe of Manasseh</a> dwell in the southern mountains of Arabia, and are very warlike.</p>
<p>The <a href="Tribe_of_Simeon" title="wikilink">Tribe of Simeon</a> and the other half of the <a href="Tribe_of_Manasseh" title="wikilink">Tribe of Manasseh</a> are in the land of the <a href="Chazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chazars</a>. They take tribute from twenty-eight kingdoms, and many Muslims are subjected to them.</p>
<p>The tribe of Dan emigrated to the land of gold, Havilah (Kush), shortly after the separation of Judah and Israel. The tribes of Naphtali, Gad, and Asher joined the Danites later. They have a king called <a href="Adiel_ben_Malkiel" title="wikilink">Adiel ben Malkiel</a>, a prince by the name of <a href="Elizaphan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elizaphan</a> of the house of Elihab, and a judge named Abdan ben Mishael, who has the power to inflict the four capital punishments prescribed in the Law. The four tribes lead a nomadic life, and are continually at war with the five neighboring Ethiopian kings. Each tribe is in the field three months, and every warrior remains in the saddle without dismounting from one Sabbath to the next. They possess the entire Scriptures, but they do not read the Roll of Esther (not having been included in the miraculous salvation mentioned in it) nor Lamentations (to avoid its disheartening influence). They have a Talmud in pure Hebrew, but none of the Talmudic teachers is mentioned. Their ritual is introduced in the name of Joshua, who had received it from Moses, who in his turn had heard its contents from the Almighty. They speak only Hebrew. (Eldad himself professed not to understand a word of Ethiopic or Arabic.)</p>
<p>On &quot;the other side of the river of Kush&quot; dwell the Bene Mosheh (tribe of <a href="Levi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Levi</a>). The River <a href="Sambation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sambation</a> encircles their land. It rolls sand and stones during the six working days and rests on the Sabbath. From the first moment of Sabbath to the last, fire surrounds the river, and during that time no human being can approach within half a mile of either side of it. The four other tribes communicate with the Bene Mosheh from the borders of the river. The Bene Mosheh dwell in beautiful houses, and no unclean animal is found in their land. Their cattle and sheep as well as their fields bear twice a year. No child dies during the lifetime of its parents, who live to see a third and fourth generation. They do not close their houses at night, for there is no theft or wickedness among them. They speak Hebrew, and never swear by the name of God.</p>
<h2 id="reception-of-his-story">Reception of his story</h2>
<p>This fanciful narrative was accepted by his contemporaries as true. Its origins are to be found in the haggadic literature, of which Eldad must have had a very extensive knowledge. The inhabitants of Kairwan were troubled by the differences between his <em><a href="halakha" title="wikilink">halakhot</a></em> and those of the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a>, and by some strange Hebrew expressions used by him; but the gaon &lt;U+1E92&gt;ema&lt;U+1E25&gt; ben Hayyim of Sura, whose opinion they had asked, soothed them by saying that there was nothing astonishing in the four tribes disagreeing with the Talmud on some halakic points. Moreover, Eldad's personality, asserted the gaon, was known to him through Isaac ben Mar and R. Sim&lt;U+1E25&gt;ah, with whom the Danite associated while he was in <a href="Babylon" title="wikilink">Babylonia</a>. <a href="Hisdai_ibn_Shaprut" title="wikilink">Hisdai ibn Shaprut</a> cites Eldad in his letter to the king of the <a href="Khazars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khazars</a>, and Eldad's halakot were used by both Rabbinites and Karaites as weapons in defense of their respective creeds. Talmudic authorities like <a href="Rashi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rashi</a>, <a href="Abraham_ben_David" title="wikilink">Abraham ben David</a> (RABaD), and <a href="Abraham_ben_Maimon" title="wikilink">Abraham ben Maimon</a> quote Eldad as an unquestioned authority; and lexicographers and grammarians interpret some Hebrew words according to the meaning given them in Eldad's phraseology.</p>
<h2 id="source-of-prester-john">Source of &quot;Prester John&quot;</h2>
<p>The influence of Eldad's narrative extended beyond <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> circles. It was the source of the apocryphal letter of the so-called &quot;<a href="Prester_John" title="wikilink">Prester John</a>,&quot; which appeared in the twelfth century. Intending to refute Eldad's assertion of the existence of independent Jewish states &lt;U+2014&gt; an assertion contrary to the teaching of the <a href="Roman-Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman-Catholic Church</a>&lt;U+2014&gt; the <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> writer told of a priest who ruled over the great kingdom of Ethiopia, to which were subject some Jewish tribes, including the Bene Mosheh who dwelt beyond the River Sambation. However, many writers of the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> expressed doubts as to the genuineness of Eldad's narrative and his halakot, most explicitly <a href="Abraham_ibn_Ezra" title="wikilink">Abraham ibn Ezra</a> (Commentary to <a href="Book_of_Exodus" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> ii. 22) and Me&lt;U+00EF&gt;r of Rothenburg (Responsa, No. 193).</p>
<h2 id="nineteenth-century-opinions">Nineteenth century opinions</h2>
<p>&quot;Modern&quot; (that is, up to 1906) critics were divided in their opinions concerning Eldad. <a href="Pinsker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pinsker</a>, <a href="Heinrich_Graetz" title="wikilink">Gr&lt;U+00E4&gt;tz</a>, and <a href="Adolf_Neubauer" title="wikilink">Adolf Neubauer</a> saw in him a <a href="Karaite_Judaism" title="wikilink">Karaite</a> missionary endeavoring to discredit the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> by his statement that the four tribes did not know the names of the <a href="Tannaim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tannaim</a> and <a href="Amoraim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amoraim</a>, and that their halakot were different from those of the Talmud. This opinion was refuted by <a href="Moses_Schorr" title="wikilink">Moses Schorr</a> and <a href="Adolf_Jellinek" title="wikilink">Adolf Jellinek</a>, who observed that Eldad's halakot contain rules concerning the examination of slaughtered animals which are not accepted by the Karaites. <a href="P._Frankl" title="wikilink">P. Frankl</a> regarded Eldad as a mere charlatan whose sayings and doings are not worth attention. <a href="Reifmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reifmann</a> denied outright the existence of Eldad, and considered the letters of the community of <a href="Kairwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kairwan</a> and of <a href="&lt;U+1E92&gt;ema&lt;U+1E25&gt;_ben_&lt;U+1E24&gt;ayyim" title="wikilink">&lt;U+1E92&gt;ema&lt;U+1E25&gt; ben &lt;U+1E24&gt;ayyim</a> of <a href="Sura" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sura</a> to be forgeries. <a href="Metz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metz</a> was the first to analyze the contents of Eldad's book in the light of the reports of other travelers. <a href="A._Epstein" title="wikilink">A. Epstein</a> followed Metz's method, and came to the conclusion that Eldad's book is like a historical novel in which truth is mixed with imagination. The halakot are, according to him, genuine, and were in use among the countrymen of Eldad, either in a province of eastern Africa or in <a href="Yemen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yemen</a>, where the Jews at that time knew Hebrew but not the Talmud. For Eldad could not have been a native of <a href="Ethiopia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ethiopia</a>, the country of the Falashas, since there only <a href="Ge&#39;ez_language" title="wikilink">Ge'ez</a> is spoken; and no trace of this language appears in Eldad's Hebrew; there are, however, some traces of Arabic, which Eldad must have known, although he asserted the contrary.</p>
<p>Some <a href="Zionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zionist</a> thinkers have considered Eldad ha-Dani to be an early precursor of their movement, as having presented to the Jews of his time the bright vision of a sovereign Jewish state. The radical <a href="Revisionist_Zionist" title="wikilink">Revisionist Zionist</a> <a href="Israel_Eldad" title="wikilink">Israel Eldad</a>, whose original family name was &quot;Scheib&quot;, had taken &quot;Eldad&quot; as his <a href="nom_de_guerre" title="wikilink">nom de guerre</a> during his involvement in the anti-British underground and later made this his official family name.</p>
