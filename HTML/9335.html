<p><strong>New York State Route 175</strong> (<strong>NY 175</strong>) is a west–east <a href="New_York_State_Route" title="wikilink">state highway</a> located in <a href="Onondaga_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Onondaga County, New York</a>, in the United States. The  route begins at an intersection with <a href="U.S._Route_20_in_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 20</a> (US 20) east of the village of <a href="Skaneateles_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Skaneateles</a> and passes through the <a href="Marcellus_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">village of Marcellus</a> before ending at a junction with <a href="U.S._Route_11_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 11</a> in <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a>. The highway was designated in the <a href="1930_state_highway_renumbering_(New_York)" title="wikilink">1930 renumbering of state highways in New York</a>.</p>
<p>The section of Route 175 from the <a href="Marcellus_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">town of Marcellus</a> to the end of the Route 173 concurrency is part of the <a href="Seneca_Turnpike" title="wikilink">Seneca Turnpike</a>, which was established in 1800 and dissolved in 1852. This portion of the Seneca Turnpike was instrumental in the development of the villages of Skaneateles and Marcellus. When designated in 1930, Route 175 was on a rural stretch of highway connecting Marcellus to <a href="Onondaga,_New_York" title="wikilink">Onondaga</a>, and brought about an increase in population and development along its route.</p>

<p>In the west, Route 175 begins at an intersection with <a href="U.S._Route_20_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 20</a> in the <a href="Skaneateles_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">town of Skaneateles</a>. The highway heads towards the northeast as Lee Mulroy Road, passing by farmlands and fields as well as several residences. As NY 175 heads to the northeast into the <a href="Marcellus_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">town of Marcellus</a>, it intersects with three county roads. This section of the route is parallel to two other unsigned county roads, located to the northwest and to the southeast.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="NY_175_Bishop_Hill.jpg" title="fig:NY 175 just east of Bishop Hill Road|alt=A two-lane highway heads through an area containing open fields and areas of trees.

A large, tree-covered ridge is in the distant background." /> As the highway heads towards the <a href="Marcellus_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">village of Marcellus</a>, it begins edging closer to <a href="New_York_State_Route_174" title="wikilink">Route 174</a>. The area becomes slightly more residential as the roads merge and become concurrent. The southern terminus of unsigned County Route 73 (CR 73, named South Street Road) is also at the intersection with NY 174.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> About  southwest of this junction, NY 175 crosses over West Nine Mile Creek on a bridge inventoried by the <a href="New_York_State_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">New York State Department of Transportation</a> (NYSDOT) as NY 175X. The bridge was built in 1962 and is maintained by <a href="Onondaga_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Onondaga County</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as is the rest of NY 175 west of NY 174.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The roads remain as such until an intersection where the county road ends and the two state routes split. In downtown Marcellus, the terrain is flat, with residential homes and commercial businesses surrounding the road. At the split, Route 174 heads to the west through the main street of the village, while Route 175 heads eastward towards Syracuse.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="marcellus-to-onondaga">Marcellus to Onondaga</h3>
<p>Route 175 heads eastward out of Marcellus along the West Seneca Turnpike. At the intersection with Frank Gay Road (<a href="County_Route_243_(Onondaga_County,_New_York)" title="wikilink">CR 243</a>), Route 175 passes a golf course and country club. The highway continues eastward into the <a href="Hamlet_(New_York)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> of Wellington Corner, before heading towards <a href="Onondaga,_New_York" title="wikilink">Onondaga</a>. There is a suburban area here, where NY 175 intersects with a county road. The highway then leaves Wellington Corner after the intersection.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

There are a few businesses in this hamlet, with Route 175 and nearby Cedarvale Road being the major roads. The highway then enters a large forested area, at times surrounded by trees. NY 175 continues northeast, passing by several more businesses and soon crosses into the town of Onondaga. In Onondaga, the route passes by the <a href="Gen._Orrin_Hutchinson_House" title="wikilink">Gen. Orrin Hutchinson House</a> and the <a href="Onondaga_Community_College" title="wikilink">Onondaga Community College</a>, intersecting with two consecutive county roads along the way before joining with <a href="New_York_State_Route_173" title="wikilink">Route 173</a>. The two roads are concurrent for about 0.2 miles (0.32 km), after which Route 173 heads east towards <a href="Manlius_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Manlius</a> while Route 175 heads northeast towards the city of <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

NY 175 passes the Community General Hospital of Greater Syracuse and intersects with a county road before entering the <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a> city limits.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from NYSDOT to the city of Syracuse.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In Syracuse, NY 175 runs along the western edge of Saint Agnes Cemetery to an intersection with <a href="New_York_State_Route_80" title="wikilink">NY 80</a> at the cemetery's north end. Much of the next area is both residential and commercial in nature, leaving the fields and forests that the route had previously followed behind.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>It intersects a number of city streets as it heads to the northeast, traversing several mixed-use blocks before crossing over Onondaga Creek, a north&lt;U+2013&gt;south waterway that passes through most of Syracuse. On the northeast bank of the creek, NY 175 turns east onto West Kennedy Street, a short connector between the creek and <a href="U.S._Route_11_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 11</a>. The route continues for three more blocks along the mostly residential street to US 11, where the east end of West Kennedy Street also marks the east end of NY 175.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The section of Route 175 from downtown Marcellus to Route 173 in Onondaga was built along the historical <a href="Seneca_Turnpike" title="wikilink">Seneca Turnpike</a>. The turnpike was originally the <a href="Genesee_Road" title="wikilink">Genesee Road</a> which began in the city of <a href="Utica,_New_York" title="wikilink">Utica</a> and ended in the city of <a href="Canandaigua_(city),_New_York" title="wikilink">Canandaigua</a>. Genesee Road was approved by the state legislature in 1794, and construction began in sections from Utica to Canandaigua. In 1800, the road was renamed to &quot;Seneca Turnpike&quot; when a law was passed to establish a maintenance company. At , the turnpike was the longest in the state at the time.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Both routes are overlapped with NY 20N, which enters Marcellus from the south on NY 174 and leaves on NY 175." /> Soon after settlement of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally bypassed the village to the north was relocated southward to go through the growing settlement.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Modern NY 175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather the length of a former trolley line that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga.
