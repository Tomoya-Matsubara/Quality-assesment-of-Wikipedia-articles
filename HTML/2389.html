<p><strong>Joseph-Georges-Gonzague &quot;Chicoutimi Cucumber&quot; V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina</strong> () (January 21, 1887 Â &lt;U+2013&gt; March 27, 1926) was a <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> professional <a href="ice_hockey" title="wikilink">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender" class="uri" title="wikilink">goaltender</a> who played seven seasons in the <a href="National_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA) and nine in the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a> (NHL), all with the <a href="Montreal_Canadiens" title="wikilink">Montreal Canadiens</a>. After being signed by the Canadiens in 1910, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and a further 39 playoff games, before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness. V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina was diagnosed with <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, and died on March 27, 1926.</p>
<p>The only goaltender to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina helped the team win the <a href="Stanley_Cup" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup</a> in <a href="1916_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1916</a> and <a href="1924_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1924</a>, while reaching the <a href="Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup Finals</a> three more times. V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina allowed the fewest goals against in the league seven times in his career: four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL. In 1918, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina became the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and earn an assist on a goal. At the start of the <a href="1926&lt;U+2013&gt;27_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1926&lt;U+2013&gt;27 NHL season</a>, the Canadiens donated the <a href="Vezina_Trophy" title="wikilink">Vezina Trophy</a> to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season. Since 1981, the award has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as determined by a vote of NHL general managers. In V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina's hometown of Chicoutimi, the sports arena is named the <a href="Centre_Georges-V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina" title="wikilink">Centre Georges-V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina</a> in honour of V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina. When the <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> opened in 1945, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina was one of the original twelve inductees.</p>

<p>Georges, the youngest of eight children, was born on January 21, 1887 in <a href="Chicoutimi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicoutimi</a>, <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>, to Jacques V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The younger Georges attended school at the Petit S&lt;U+00E9&gt;minaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates for the first time at age sixteen when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>, more than 200 kilometres from <a href="Quebec_City" title="wikilink">Quebec City</a>, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguen&lt;U+00E9&gt;ens (&quot;People from the Saguenay&quot;, the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.<ref name="Jenish 2008 pp=34<U+2013>35&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina married Marie-Ad&lt;U+00E9&gt;la&lt;U+00EF&gt;de-Stella Morin on June 3, 1908 in Chicoutimi.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina's death, it was reported that he fathered twenty-two children. This rumour was started when the Canadiens' manager, <a href="Leo_Dandurand" title="wikilink">Leo Dandurand</a>, told reporters that V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina &quot;speaks no English and has twenty-two children, including three sets of triplets, and they were all born in the space of nine years.&quot; In actuality the V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zinas only had two children and Georges spoke broken English.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1912 they had their first child, a son named Jean-Jules. A second son was born the night of the Montreal Canadiens' first Stanley Cup win in 1916. To honour the event, Georges named the child Marcel Stanley.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When not playing hockey, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina operated a <a href="tanning" title="wikilink">tannery</a> in Chicoutimi, living a quiet life.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina shut out the Blueshirts in the first game, a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win for Montreal, but let in six goals in the second game, allowing the Blueshirts to play for the Stanley Cup, which they won.</p>

<p>The NHA gave way to the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) in November 1917, with V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina and the Canadiens joining the new league.

Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina had been to the team.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<p>One of the most dominant goaltenders in the NHA and early NHL, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina led the Canadiens to five <a href="Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup Finals</a> appearances, where they won the title twice.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Seven times in his career, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina had the lowest goals against average in the league he played, and he had the second best average another five times.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> From when he joined the Canadiens in 1910, until being forced to retire in 1925, V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina never missed a game nor allowed a substitute, playing in 328 consecutive regular season games and an additional 39 playoff games.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Though he played the bulk of his career in an era when goaltenders could not leave their feet to make a save (the rule was changed in 1918),<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina is regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders in hockey history;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> the <em>Montreal Standard</em> referred to him as the &quot;greatest goaltender of the last two decades&quot; in their obituary.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>A lasting legacy of V&lt;U+00E9&gt;zina was the trophy named after him.
