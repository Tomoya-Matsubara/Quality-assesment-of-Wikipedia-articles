<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="BeachSuburbs0013.jpg" title="fig:Rock carving at North Curl Curl Beach" alt="Rock carving at North Curl Curl Beach" width="120" /> Curl Curl may be derived from the <a href="Indigenous_Australian" title="wikilink">Aboriginal</a> phrase <em>curial curial</em>, meaning <em>river of life</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The name Curl Curl Lagoon was originally applied to Manly Lagoon, which empties into the ocean at <a href="Queenscliff,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Queenscliff</a>, and the current Curl Curl Lagoon was named Harbord Lagoon. This was a result of the land grant of 'Harbord' originally being much larger than <a href="Freshwater,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">the suburb that later bore this name</a>. The names were changed as a part of a renaming program in the 1980s to reflect the true location of the lagoons.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
