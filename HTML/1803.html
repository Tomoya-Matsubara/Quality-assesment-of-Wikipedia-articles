<p>Although the majority of The Beatles' songs were written by <a href="Lennon_and_McCartney" title="wikilink">Lennon and McCartney</a>, Harrison generally wrote one song per side from the <em><a href="Help!_(album)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em> album onwards.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His later compositions with The Beatles include &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Sun</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="Something" class="uri" title="wikilink">Something</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="While_My_Guitar_Gently_Weeps" title="wikilink">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>.&quot; After the band's breakup, Harrison continued writing, releasing the acclaimed and successful triple album, <em><a href="All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a></em>, in 1970, from which came the #1 single &quot;<a href="My_Sweet_Lord" title="wikilink">My Sweet Lord</a>&quot;.

<p>Harrison embraced <a href="Culture_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian culture</a> and <a href="Hinduism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hinduism</a> in the 1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of <a href="sitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitar</a> music and of the <a href="Hare_Krishna_movement" title="wikilink">Hare Krishna movement</a>. With <a href="Ravi_Shankar" title="wikilink">Ravi Shankar</a> he organised a major charity concert with the 1971 <em><a href="Concert_for_Bangladesh" title="wikilink">Concert for Bangladesh</a></em>, and is the only Beatle to have published an autobiography, with <em>I Me Mine</em> in 1980.</p>

His mother, Louise (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e French), was a Liverpool shop assistant, and his father, Harold Hargreaves Harrison, was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the <a href="White_Star_Line" title="wikilink">White Star Line</a>. The family were <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a>;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> his maternal grandfather, John French, was born in <a href="County_Wexford" title="wikilink">County Wexford</a>, emigrating to Liverpool where he married a local girl, Louise Woollam.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Harrison was born in the house where he lived for his first seven years: <a href="12_Arnold_Grove" title="wikilink">12 Arnold Grove</a>, <a href="Wavertree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wavertree</a>, Liverpool, which was a small 2 up, 2 down terraced house in a cul-de-sac, with an alley to the rear. The only heating was a single coal fire, and the toilet was outside. In 1950 the family were offered a <a href="council_house" title="wikilink">council house</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and moved to 25 Upton Green, <a href="Speke" class="uri" title="wikilink">Speke</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Sutcliffe_and_Harrison.jpg" title="fig:Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison in Hamburg" alt="Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison in Hamburg" /> Harrison became part of The Beatles when they were still a <a href="skiffle_group" title="wikilink">skiffle group</a> called <a href="The_Quarrymen" title="wikilink">The Quarrymen</a>. McCartney had told Lennon about his friend George Harrison, who could play &quot;<a href="Raunchy_(song)" title="wikilink">Raunchy</a>&quot; on his guitar. Though Lennon considered him too young to join the band,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Harrison hung out with them and filled in as needed. By the time he was 16 Lennon and the others had accepted him as one of the band;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> though because Harrison was the youngest member of the group, he was looked upon as a kid by the others for another few years.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>When The Beatles were offered work in Hamburg in 1960, Harrison quit his job at local department store <a href="Blacklers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blacklers</a> in order to go along. His intention at this time was to work as a musician for a few years, then possibly try to get into art school.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The musical apprenticeship that Harrison went through playing at the <a href="Kaiserkeller" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiserkeller</a>, including guitar lessons from <a href="Tony_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Tony Sheridan</a>, laid the foundations of The Beatles' sound, and of Harrison's quiet, professional role within the group;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> a role that would contribute to his reputation as &quot;the quiet Beatle&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> However, the first trip to Hamburg was shortened when Harrison was deported for being underage.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>When <a href="Brian_Epstein" title="wikilink">Brian Epstein</a> became The Beatles manager in December 1961 after seeing them perform at <a href="The_Cavern_Club" title="wikilink">The Cavern Club</a> in November,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> he changed their image,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and secured them a recording contract with EMI. The first single, &quot;<a href="Love_Me_Do" title="wikilink">Love Me Do</a>&quot;, with Harrison playing a <a href="Gibson_J-160E" title="wikilink">Gibson J-160E</a>,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> reached #17 in the UK chart in October 1962,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and by the time their first album, <em><a href="Please_Please_Me" title="wikilink">Please Please Me</a></em>, was released in early 1963, The Beatles had become famous and <a href="Beatlemania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beatlemania</a> had arrived.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <img src="The_Beatles_in_America.JPG" title="fig:Harrison with the rest of the Fab Four in America in 1964" alt="Harrison with the rest of the Fab Four in America in 1964" /> Harrison was very popular with the girls, getting an estimated 30,000 gifts and cards for his 21st birthday. After he revealed in an interview that he liked <a href="jelly_babies" title="wikilink">jelly babies</a>, audiences would shower him and the rest of the band with the sweets at live concerts and fans would send boxes of them as gifts.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Unfortunately American fans could not get a hold of this soft British <a href="confection" class="uri" title="wikilink">confection</a>, replacing them with the harder <a href="jelly_beans" title="wikilink">jelly beans</a> instead, much to the groups discomfort, they were occasionally pelted with them during concerts while in America.</p>
<p>The popularity of The Beatles led to a successful tour of America, the making of a film, <em><a href="A_Hard_Day&#39;s_Night_(film)" title="wikilink">A Hard Day's Night</a></em> (during which Harrison met his future wife <a href="Pattie_Boyd" title="wikilink">Pattie Boyd</a>), and being awarded the <a href="MBE" class="uri" title="wikilink">MBE</a>. Harrison, whose role within the group of the careful musician who checked the instruments were tuned,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> was by 1965 and the <em><a href="Rubber_Soul" title="wikilink">Rubber Soul</a></em> album, developing further into musical director when he led the others into folk-rock, via his interest in <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a> and <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and into Indian music with his exploration of the sitar.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Harrison's musical involvement and cohesion with the group reached its peak on <a href="Revolver_(album)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a> in 1966 with his contribution of three songs and new musical ideas.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> By 1967, Harrison's interests appeared to be more outside The Beatles, and his involvement in <a href="Sgt._Pepper&#39;s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="wikilink">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a> mainly consists of his one song, <a href="Within_You_Without_You" title="wikilink">Within You Without You</a>, on which no other Beatle plays,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and which stands out as not in keeping with the rest of the album.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>During the recording of <em><a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink">The White Album</a></em> in 1968 tensions were present in the band;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> these surfaced again during the filming of rehearsal sessions at <a href="Twickenham_Studios" title="wikilink">Twickenham Studios</a> for the <em><a href="Let_it_Be" title="wikilink">Let it Be</a></em> album. Frustrated by ongoing slights, the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, and Lennon's creative disengagement from the group, Harrison quit the band on 10 January. He returned on 22 January after negotiations with the other Beatles at two business meetings.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Relations between the Beatles were more cordial (though still strained) during recordings for the album <em><a href="Abbey_Road_(album)" title="wikilink">Abbey Road</a></em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The album included &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Sun</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Something" class="uri" title="wikilink">Something</a>&quot;, which was later recorded by <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a>, who considered it &quot;the greatest love song of the last fifty years&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Harrison's increasing productivity, coupled with his difficulties in getting The Beatles to record his music, meant that by the end of the group's career he had amassed a considerable stockpile of unreleased material.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Harrison's last recording session with The Beatles was on 4 January 1970.

<h3 id="guitar-work">Guitar work</h3>
<p>Harrison's guitar work with The Beatles was varied, flexible and occasionally innovative; though not fast or flashy, his guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 60s.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The first notable Harrison guitar solo was the sensitive extended acoustic guitar work of &quot;<a href="Till_There_Was_You" title="wikilink">Till There Was You</a>&quot; for which Harrison purchased a <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez</a> nylon-stringed classical guitar.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Toward the end of the 60s and into the 1970s his guitar work developed, particularly his <a href="slide_guitar#history" title="wikilink">slide guitar</a> playing,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> which was first recorded during an early session of &quot;<a href="If_Not_for_You" title="wikilink">If Not for You</a>&quot; for Dylan's <em><a href="New_Morning" title="wikilink">New Morning</a></em>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>    Harrison's first electric guitar was a Czech built Futurama/Grazioso,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> which was a popular guitar among British guitarists in the early 60s.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> However, the guitars Harrison used on early recordings were mainly <a href="Gretsch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gretsch</a> played through a <a href="Vox_AC30" title="wikilink">Vox amp</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He used a variety of Gretsch,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> including a <a href="Gretsch_Duo_Jet" title="wikilink">Gretsch Duo Jet</a> - his first Gretsch, which he bought in 1961 second hand off a sailor in Liverpool;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> a Gretch Tennessean,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and the Gretsch Country Gentleman, bought new for &lt;U+00A3&gt;234 in April 1963 at the Sound City store in London, which he used on &quot;<a href="She_Loves_You" title="wikilink">She Loves You</a>&quot;, and on The Beatles 1964 appearance on the <a href="Ed_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Ed Sullivan</a> TV show.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <img src="Harrison_&amp;_Shankar.jpg" title="fig:Ravi Shankar with his student George Harrison, 1967" alt="Ravi Shankar with his student George Harrison, 1967" /> During The Beatles' first trip to the U.S., in February 1964, Harrison acquired a <a href="Rickenbacker_360/12" title="wikilink">Rickenbacker 360/12</a> guitar. He had tried out the 12-string electric guitar during an interview with a Minneapolis radio station, and was given the guitar either by the <a href="Rickenbacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rickenbacker</a> company or the radio station.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The 360/12 was an experimental <a href="12-string" class="uri" title="wikilink">12-string</a> guitar with the strings reversed so that the lower pitched string was struck first, and with an unusual <a href="headstock" class="uri" title="wikilink">headstock</a> design that made tuning easier.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Harrison used the guitar extensively during the recording of <em><a href="A_Hard_Day&#39;s_Night" title="wikilink">A Hard Day's Night</a></em>, and the <a href="Jangle_pop" title="wikilink">jangle sound</a> became so popular that the <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> termed it &quot;the beat boys' secret weapon&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <a href="Roger_McGuinn" title="wikilink">Roger McGuinn</a> liked the effect Harrison achieved so much that it became his signature guitar sound with <a href="the_Byrds" title="wikilink">the Byrds</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>He got his first <a href="Fender_Stratocaster" title="wikilink">Fender Stratocaster</a> in 1965 and used it for the recording of the <em><a href="Rubber_Soul" title="wikilink">Rubber Soul</a></em> album, most notably on the &quot;<a href="Nowhere_Man" title="wikilink">Nowhere Man</a>&quot; track, where he played in unison with Lennon who also had a Stratocaster.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Lennon and Harrison both had Sonic Blue Stratocasters, which were bought second hand by roadie <a href="Mal_Evans" title="wikilink">Mal Evans</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Harrison painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word &quot;Bebopalula&quot; painted above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, &quot;Rocky&quot;, painted on the headstock.

<p><img src="The_Beatles_album_cover.jpg" title="fig:The White Album contains four of Harrison&#39;s compositions" alt="The White Album contains four of Harrison&#39;s compositions" /> Harrison wrote his first song, &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Bother_Me" title="wikilink">Don't Bother Me</a>&quot;, while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> as an exercise &quot;to see if I could write a song&quot;, as he remembered.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; appeared on the second Beatles album (<em><a href="With_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">With the Beatles</a></em>) later that year, then on <em><a href="Meet_the_Beatles!" title="wikilink">Meet the Beatles!</a></em> in the U.S. in early 1964, and also briefly in the film <em><a href="A_Hard_Day&#39;s_Night_(film)" title="wikilink">A Hard Day's Night</a></em>. The group did not record another Harrison composition until 1965, when he contributed &quot;<a href="I_Need_You_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">I Need You</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="You_Like_Me_Too_Much" title="wikilink">You Like Me Too Much</a>&quot; to the album <em><a href="Help!_(album)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em>.</p>
<p>Harrison's songwriting improved greatly through the years, but his material did not earn respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's breakup.

<p>Harrison performed the lead vocal on all Beatles songs that he wrote by himself.

<p>Before The Beatles split up in 1970 Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums, <em><a href="Wonderwall_Music" title="wikilink">Wonderwall Music</a></em> and <em><a href="Electronic_Sound" title="wikilink">Electronic Sound</a></em>. These albums, however, were mainly instrumental. <em>Wonderwall Music</em> was a soundtrack to the <em><a href="Wonderwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wonderwall</a></em> film in which Harrison blended Indian and Western sounds;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> while <em>Electronic Sound</em> was an experiment in using a <a href="Moog_synthesizer" title="wikilink">Moog synthesiser</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It was only when Harrison was free from The Beatles that he released what is regarded as his first &quot;real&quot; solo album, the commercially successful and critically acclaimed <em><a href="#All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a></em>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="all-things-must-pass">All Things Must Pass</h3>

<p>After years of being restricted in his song-writing contributions to The Beatles, <em><a href="All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a></em> contained such a large outpouring of Harrison's songs that it was released as a <a href="triple_album" title="wikilink">triple album</a>,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> though only two of the discs contained songs - the third contained recordings of Harrison <a href="Jam_session" title="wikilink">jamming</a> with friends.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> <a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The album is regarded as his best work;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> it was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> and producing the number-one <a href="hit_single" title="wikilink">hit single</a> &quot;<a href="My_Sweet_Lord" title="wikilink">My Sweet Lord</a>&quot; as well as the top-10 single &quot;<a href="What_Is_Life" title="wikilink">What Is Life</a>.&quot; The album was co-produced by <a href="Phil_Spector" title="wikilink">Phil Spector</a>, and the musicians included <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Dave_Mason" title="wikilink">Dave Mason</a>, <a href="Billy_Preston" title="wikilink">Billy Preston</a>, and <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Harrison was later sued for <a href="copyright_infringement" title="wikilink">copyright infringement</a> over the single &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; because of its similarity to the 1963 <a href="The_Chiffons" title="wikilink">Chiffons</a> single &quot;<a href="He&#39;s_So_Fine" title="wikilink">He's So Fine</a>&quot;, owned by Bright Tunes. Harrison denied deliberately stealing the song, but he lost the resulting court case in 1976 as the judge accepted that Harrison had &quot;subconsciously&quot; plagiarised &quot;He's So Fine&quot;. When considering liable earnings, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;'s contribution to the sales of <em>All Things Must Pass</em> and <em><a href="The_Best_of_George_Harrison" title="wikilink">The Best of George Harrison</a></em> were taken into account, and the judge decided a figure of $1,599,987 was owed to Bright Tunes.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The dispute over damages became complicated when Harrison's manager <a href="Allen_Klein" title="wikilink">Allen Klein</a> changed sides by buying Bright Tunes and then continuing the suit against Harrison. In 1981, a district judge decided that Klein had acted improperly, and it was agreed that Harrison should pay Klein $587,000, the amount Klein had paid for Bright Tunes - so he would gain nothing from the deal, and that Harrison would take over ownership of Bright Tunes, making him the owner of the rights to both &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;He's So Fine&quot; and thus ending the copyright infringement claim. Though the dispute dragged on into the 1990s, the district judge's decision was upheld.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u20131980">1970&lt;U+2013&gt;1980</h3>
<p>Harrison would not again release an album that came close to the critical and commercial achievements of <em>All Things Must Pass</em>. Although 1973's <em><a href="Living_in_the_Material_World" title="wikilink">Living in the Material World</a></em> initially did well, holding #1 on the U.S. album chart for 5 weeks, and the album's single, &quot;<a href="Give_Me_Love_(Give_Me_Peace_on_Earth)" title="wikilink">Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)</a>&quot;, was also successful reaching #1 in the U.S., neither could match the sales of <em>All Things Must Pass</em> and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. The <em><a href="Dark_Horse_(album)" title="wikilink">Dark Horse</a></em> album of 1974, which was accompanied by a tour of North America, made the Top 5 in the U.S. album chart, but failed to chart in the UK. The song &quot;<a href="Dark_Horse_(song)" title="wikilink">Dark Horse</a>&quot; was released as the second single and reached #15 on Billboard.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>His final studio album for EMI (and Apple Records) was <em><a href="Extra_Texture_(Read_All_About_It)" title="wikilink">Extra Texture (Read All About It)</a></em>, featuring a <a href="diecutting" title="wikilink">diecut</a> cover. The album spawned two singles, &quot;<a href="You_(George_Harrison_song)" title="wikilink">You</a>&quot; which reached the Billboard top 20 and &quot;<a href="This_Guitar_(Can&#39;t_Keep_From_Crying)" title="wikilink">This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying)</a>&quot;, which became Apple's final original single release in 1975. <a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> It was also the first solo Beatles single that failed to chart in the U.S. Following the former Beatle's departure from Capitol, the record company was in a position to licence releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album, using Harrison for this experiment. <em><a href="The_Best_of_George_Harrison" title="wikilink">The Best of George Harrison</a></em> (1976) combined his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.</p>
<p><em><a href="Thirty_Three_&amp;_1/3" title="wikilink">Thirty Three &amp; 1/3</a></em> his first Dark Horse release, was his most successful late-1970s album, reaching #11 on the U.S. charts in 1976, and producing the singles &quot;<a href="This_Song" title="wikilink">This Song</a>&quot; (a satire of the &quot;<a href="My_Sweet_Lord" title="wikilink">My Sweet Lord</a>&quot;-&quot;<a href="He&#39;s_So_Fine" title="wikilink">He's So Fine</a>&quot; court case ruling) and &quot;<a href="Crackerbox_Palace" title="wikilink">Crackerbox Palace</a>&quot;.

Both the album and &quot;Blow Away&quot; made the Billboard top 20.</p>
<p>On 23 November 1971, Harrison appeared on an episode of <em><a href="The_Dick_Cavett_Show" title="wikilink">The Dick Cavett Show</a></em> in a band called Wonder Wheel performing a song written by <a href="Gary_Wright" title="wikilink">Gary Wright</a> called &quot;Two Faced Man&quot;.

<p>In addition to his own works during this time, Harrison co-wrote or produced two hits for Starr (&quot;<a href="It_Don&#39;t_Come_Easy" title="wikilink">It Don't Come Easy</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Photograph_(Ringo_Starr_song)" title="wikilink">Photograph</a>&quot;) and appeared on tracks by Lennon &quot;<a href="How_Do_You_Sleep?" title="wikilink">How Do You Sleep?</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Oh_My_Love" title="wikilink">Oh My Love</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Gimme_Some_Truth" title="wikilink">Gimme Some Truth</a>&quot;, <a href="Harry_Nilsson" title="wikilink">Harry Nilsson</a> (&quot;You're Breakin' My Heart&quot;), <a href="Badfinger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badfinger</a> (&quot;Day After Day&quot;) on which he played slide guitar, as well as working with <a href="Billy_Preston" title="wikilink">Billy Preston</a> (&quot;<a href="That&#39;s_the_Way_God_Planned_It" title="wikilink">That's the Way God Planned It</a>&quot;, 1969 and &quot;<a href="It&#39;s_My_Pleasure" title="wikilink">It's My Pleasure</a>&quot;, 1975) and <a href="Cheech_&amp;_Chong" title="wikilink">Cheech &amp; Chong</a> (&quot;<a href="Basketball_Jones" title="wikilink">Basketball Jones</a>&quot;).</p>
<h3 id="u20131989">1980&lt;U+2013&gt;1989</h3>
<p>Harrison was deeply shocked by the December 1980 <a href="Death_of_John_Lennon" title="wikilink">murder of John Lennon</a>. The crime reinforced his decades-long worries about safety from <a href="stalking" title="wikilink">stalkers</a>. It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike former bandmates McCartney and Starr, Harrison had little contact with Lennon in the years before the murder. Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon. &quot;<a href="All_Those_Years_Ago_(song)" title="wikilink">All Those Years Ago</a>&quot; received substantial radio airplay, reaching #2 on the U.S. charts.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> All three remaining Beatles performed on it, although it was expressly a Harrison single. &quot;Teardrops&quot; was issued as a follow-up single, but was not nearly as successful. Both singles came from the album <em><a href="Somewhere_in_England" title="wikilink">Somewhere in England</a></em>, released in 1981. Originally slated for release in late 1980, <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> rejected the album, ordering Harrison to replace several tracks, and to change the album cover as well. The original album cover that Harrison wanted was used in the 2004 reissue of the album. In 1981, Harrison played guitar on one track of <a href="Mick_Fleetwood" title="wikilink">Mick Fleetwood</a>'s record <em>The Visitor</em> and <a href="Lindsey_Buckingham" title="wikilink">Lindsey Buckingham</a>'s song &quot;Walk a Thin Line&quot;.</p>
<p>Aside from a song on the <em><a href="Porky&#39;s_Revenge" title="wikilink">Porky's Revenge</a></em> soundtrack in 1984 (his version of a little-known <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a> song &quot;I Don't Want To Do It&quot;), Harrison released no new records for five years after 1982's <em><a href="Gone_Troppo" title="wikilink">Gone Troppo</a></em> received apparent indifference. In 1985, Harrison made a rare public appearance on the <a href="Showtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">Showtime</a> special <em><a href="Carl_Perkins" title="wikilink">Carl Perkins</a> and Friends</em> along with Starr and Clapton among others. He only agreed to appear because he was a close admirer of Perkins.</p>
<p>In 1987 Harrison returned with the critically acclaimed platinum album <em><a href="Cloud_Nine_(George_Harrison_album)" title="wikilink">Cloud Nine</a></em>, co-produced with <a href="Jeff_Lynne" title="wikilink">Jeff Lynne</a> of <a href="Electric_Light_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Electric Light Orchestra</a>, and enjoyed a hit (#1 in the U.S.; #2 in the UK) when his rendition of <a href="James_Ray_(singer)" title="wikilink">James Ray</a>'s early 1960s number &quot;<a href="Got_My_Mind_Set_on_You" title="wikilink">Got My Mind Set on You</a>&quot; was released as a single; another single, &quot;<a href="When_We_Was_Fab" title="wikilink">When We Was Fab</a>&quot;, a retrospective of The Beatles' days complete with musical flavours for each bandmate, was also a minor hit. <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> regularly played the two videos, and elevated Harrison's public profile with another generation of music listeners. The album reached #8 and #10 on the U.S. and UK charts, respectively. In the U.S., several tracks also enjoyed high placement on Billboard's Album Rock chart - &quot;Devil's Radio,&quot; &quot;<a href="This_Is_Love_(George_Harrison_song)" title="wikilink">This Is Love</a>&quot; and &quot;Cloud 9&quot; in addition to the aforementioned singles.</p>
<p>Early in 1989, Harrison, Lynne and ex-Beatle Ringo Starr all appeared on <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a>'s &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; music video, although Starr did not actually play on the track;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Harrison played acoustic guitar. The same year also saw the release of <em><a href="Best_of_Dark_Horse_1976&lt;U+2013&gt;1989" title="wikilink">Best of Dark Horse 1976&lt;U+2013&gt;1989</a></em>, a compilation drawn from his later solo work. This album also included two new songs, &quot;Poor Little Girl&quot;, and &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot; (which saw him once again looking wryly upon his Beatle past), as well as &quot;<a href="Cheer_Down" title="wikilink">Cheer Down</a>&quot;, which had first been released earlier in the year on the soundtrack to the film <em><a href="Lethal_Weapon_2" title="wikilink">Lethal Weapon 2</a></em>, which starred <a href="Mel_Gibson" title="wikilink">Mel Gibson</a> and <a href="Danny_Glover" title="wikilink">Danny Glover</a>. Unlike his previous greatest hits package, Harrison made sure to oversee this compilation. In 1989 Harrison played slide guitar on the &quot;<a href="Leave_a_Light_On" title="wikilink">Leave a Light On</a>&quot; song from <a href="Belinda_Carlisle" title="wikilink">Belinda Carlisle</a>'s third album &quot;<a href="Runaway_Horses" title="wikilink">Runaway Horses</a>&quot;.

<p>In 1988, Harrison played an instrumental role in forming the Traveling Wilburys with <a href="Roy_Orbison" title="wikilink">Roy Orbison</a>, <a href="Jeff_Lynne" title="wikilink">Jeff Lynne</a>, <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, and <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a> when they gathered in Dylan's garage to quickly record an additional track for a projected Harrison European single release.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The record company realised the track (&quot;<a href="Handle_With_Care_(song)" title="wikilink">Handle With Care</a>&quot;) was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full, separate album. This had to be completed within two weeks, as Dylan was scheduled to start a tour. The album, <em><a href="Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._1" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1</a></em>, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers (supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.). Harrison's pseudonym on the first album was &quot;Nelson Wilbury&quot;; he would use the name &quot;Spike Wilbury&quot; for the Traveling Wilburys' second album.</p>
<p>After the death of Roy Orbison in late 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece. There is speculation the band approached <a href="Del_Shannon" title="wikilink">Del Shannon</a> to fill the vacant slot; however, this rumour has not been confirmed or denied by the surviving members.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Though <em><a href="Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._3" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3</a></em> was their second release, the album was mischievously titled <em>Vol. 3</em> by Harrison. According to Lynne, &quot;That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.' &quot; <a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> It was not as well received as the previous album, but did reach #14 in the UK and #11 in the US where it went platinum, while the singles &quot;<a href="She&#39;s_My_Baby" title="wikilink">She's My Baby</a>&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Wilbury_Twist" title="wikilink">Wilbury Twist</a>&quot; got decent air play.</p>
<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>
<p>Harrison launched a major tour of the United States in 1974. Critical and fan reaction panned the tour for its long mid-concert act of Pandit Ravi Shankar &amp; Friends and for Harrison's hoarse voice. Harrison had hired filmmaker <a href="David_Acomba" title="wikilink">David Acomba</a> to accompany the tour and gather footage for a documentary. Due to Harrison's hoarse voice throughout most of this tour, the film was not released, but in 2007 Acomba placed a newly revised director's cut in the Harrison archive.</p>
<p>In 1986, Harrison made a surprise performance at &quot;Heartbeat '86&quot;, a concert event to raise money for the <a href="Birmingham_Children&#39;s_Hospital" title="wikilink">Birmingham Children's Hospital</a>. Harrison played and sang the finale &quot;<a href="Johnny_B._Goode" title="wikilink">Johnny B.

<p>In 1991, Harrison staged a tour of Japan along with <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>. It was his first tour since the 1974 U.S. tour, but no other tours followed. The <em><a href="Live_in_Japan_(George_Harrison_album)" title="wikilink">Live in Japan</a></em> recording came from these shows. In October 1992, Harrison played three songs (&quot;<a href="If_Not_for_You" title="wikilink">If Not for You</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Absolutely_Sweet_Marie" title="wikilink">Absolutely Sweet Marie</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="My_Back_Pages" title="wikilink">My Back Pages</a>&quot;) at a huge <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a> tribute concert at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York City.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>Harrison's final television appearance was not intended as such; in fact, he was not the featured artist, and the appearance had been intended to promote <em><a href="Chants_of_India" title="wikilink">Chants of India</a></em>, another collaboration with Ravi Shankar released in 1997, at the height of interest in <a href="chant" class="uri" title="wikilink">chant</a> music. <a href="John_Fugelsang" title="wikilink">John Fugelsang</a>, then of <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a>, conducted the interview, and at one point an acoustic guitar was produced and handed to Harrison.

<p>In January 1998, Harrison attended the funeral of his boyhood idol, <a href="Carl_Perkins" title="wikilink">Carl Perkins</a>, in <a href="Jackson,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Jackson, Tennessee</a>. Harrison played an impromptu version of Perkins' song &quot;Your True Love&quot; during the service.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> That same year he attended the public memorial service for <a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda McCartney</a>.

<p>In late 1999 Harrison survived a knife attack by an intruder in his home.

Harrison's interest in Indian culture expanded to Hinduism. During a pilgrimage to <a href="Bombay,_India" title="wikilink">Bombay, India</a> with his wife, Harrison studied sitar, met several <a href="guru" title="wikilink">gurus</a> and visited various holy places, filling the months between the end of the final Beatles tour in 1966 and the commencement of the <em><a href="Sgt._Pepper&#39;s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="wikilink">Sgt.
