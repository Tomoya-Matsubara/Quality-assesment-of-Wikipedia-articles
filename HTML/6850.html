<p><strong><em>An Inconvenient Book</em></strong> is a <a href="Non-fiction" title="wikilink">non-fiction</a> book on <a href="politics" class="uri" title="wikilink">politics</a> by <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> <a href="Talk_radio" title="wikilink">Talk radio</a> host and <a href="Headline_News" title="wikilink">CNN Headline News</a> commentator <a href="Glenn_Beck" title="wikilink">Glenn Beck</a>. The full title is <em>An Inconvenient Book: Real Solutions to the World&lt;U+2019&gt;s Biggest Problems</em>.</p>
<p>The book also attributes persons other than Beck as partial writers of the book: Kevin Balfe, <a href="Steve_Burguiere" title="wikilink">Steve &lt;U+201C&gt;Stu&lt;U+201D&gt; Burguiere</a>, Dan Andros, and Paul Starke.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="explanation-of-the-books-title">Explanation of the book's title</h2>
<p>The title of <em>An Inconvenient Book</em> is a parody of the title of the <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a> documentary <em><a href="An_Inconvenient_Truth" title="wikilink">An Inconvenient Truth</a></em>, and one section of the book provides a response to the claims of Al Gore and other <a href="anthropogenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropogenic</a> <a href="global_warming" title="wikilink">global warming</a> advocates.</p>
<p>The book offers further explanation of the book&lt;U+2019&gt;s title: &lt;U+201C&gt;Have you ever wondered why some of the biggest problems we face, from illegal immigration to global warming to poverty, never seem to get fixed? The reason is simple: the solutions just aren&lt;U+2019&gt;t <em>convenient</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;. Fortunately, radio and television host Glenn Beck doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t care much about convenience; he cares about common sense&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
