<p>Tariq Farid was born near <a href="Lahore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahore</a>, <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in 1969, the oldest of six children of Ghulam and Salma Farid. His father emigrated to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the 1970s, working in <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a> as a machinist. Tariq Farid arrived in the United States with the rest of the family in 1981, when he was 11 years old.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a teenager, Tariq mowed lawns and worked in a <a href="McDonald&lt;U+2019&gt;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">McDonald&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> restaurant. In 1986, when he was 17, the family bought and began operating a <a href="flower_shop" title="wikilink">flower shop</a> in <a href="East_Haven,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">East Haven, Connecticut</a>. While working in the family business, which expanded to additional locations, Tariq developed a computerized <a href="point_of_sale" title="wikilink">point of sale</a> system for floral shops, and struck out on his own in 1991 in a business selling computer systems to flower retailers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="business-ventures">Business ventures</h2>
<p>By 1993, the computer enterprise grew into the computer <a href="software" class="uri" title="wikilink">software</a> distributor Netsolace.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1999, he and his brothers partnered to open the first Edible Arrangements store in <a href="Hamden,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Hamden, Connecticut</a>. The business specializes in fresh <a href="fruit" class="uri" title="wikilink">fruit</a> arrangements, melding the concept of <a href="fruit_basket" title="wikilink">fruit baskets</a> with design inspired by the floral business.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After designing the computer systems, training manuals, production and profitability tracking and supply chain management process, they began franchising the concept in 2001. As president and CEO, Farid has grown the company to more than 1,000 stores serving locations in the United States, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>, the <a href="United_Arab_Emirates" title="wikilink">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Saudi_Arabia" title="wikilink">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="Kuwait" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuwait</a>, <a href="Qatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qatar</a>, <a href="Bahrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahrain</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, and <a href="Jordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordan</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In March 2008 the company was reported to have annual revenues of $195 million.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006, Farid also launched the franchise concept Frutation by Edible Arrangements out of his desire to provide consumers an &lt;U+201C&gt;on-the-go&lt;U+201D&gt; option.</p>
<p>In 2010, Edible Arrangements faced dissatisfaction from some of its franchisees. In January 2010, more than 270 franchisees presented Farid with individual letters expressing opposition to corporate policies and practices that they considered to be harmful to their individual franchised businesses. The franchisees formed an association known as &quot;EA Independent Franchisees Association, LLC&quot;, or &quot;EAIFA&quot; and hired an <a href="Attorney_at_law" title="wikilink">attorney</a> to represent them in possible <a href="litigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">litigation</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On September 20, 2010 the group filed a <a href="lawsuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawsuit</a> in <a href="U.S._federal_court" title="wikilink">federal court</a> on behalf of 170 franchisees, alleging that several changes the company made in its franchise agreements were unfair or violated contractual obligations to the franchisees.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Edible Arrangements International, responded to inquiries about the lawsuit by saying that they strongly disagreed with the accusations and would vigorously defend the complaint. The company subsequently initiated a motion in the courts to dismiss the case, but this attempt was denied by a District of Connectcut judge on July 19, 2011 and the franchisees were granted authority to pursue the case on all claims.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
