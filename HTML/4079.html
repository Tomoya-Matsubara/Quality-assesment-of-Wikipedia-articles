The series takes place in a fictional version of Tokyo, Japan, where five adolescent girls, called Mew Mews, are infused with the DNA of endangered species to combat aliens attempting to take over the Earth. The manga series is followed by a short sequel series, <em>Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode</em>, which introduces a new Mew Mew and a new threat.</p>
<p>The Mew Mews are led by the main character, <a href="#Ichigo_Momomiya" title="wikilink">Ichigo Momomiya</a>, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: <a href="#Mint_Aizawa" title="wikilink">Mint Aizawa</a>, <a href="#Lettuce_Midorikawa" title="wikilink">Lettuce Midorikawa</a>, <a href="#Pudding_Fong" title="wikilink">Pudding Fong</a>, and <a href="#Zakuro_Fujiwara" title="wikilink">Zakuro Fujiwara</a>. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on <a href="#Masaya_Aoyama" title="wikilink">Masaya Aoyama</a> to becoming his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, <a href="#Kish" title="wikilink">Kish</a>, <a href="#Pie" title="wikilink">Pie</a>, and <a href="#Tart" title="wikilink">Tart</a>, and their leader, <a href="#Deep_Blue" title="wikilink">Deep Blue</a>. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In <em>a la Mode</em>, <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">middle school</a> student <a href="#Berry_Shirayuki" title="wikilink">Berry Shirayuki</a> is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, in the absence of Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. <em>A la Mode</em> also introduces new set of antagonists, the <a href="#Saint_Rose_Crusaders" title="wikilink">Saint Rose Crusaders</a>, a group of human teenagers with various <a href="psychic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychic</a> abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by <a href="#Duke" title="wikilink">Duke</a>, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.</p>
<p>Ikumi's initial vision for <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em> was a story called <em>Tokyo Black Cat Girl</em> that featured a cat-girl battling alien invaders. After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superheroes, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, as well as for their cute appearances. The characters introduced in <em>a la Mode</em> were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series. The character Duke was also criticized for having a design reminiscent of the <a href="white_supremacy" title="wikilink">white supremacy</a> group, the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>. </p>
<h2 id="creation-and-conception">Creation and conception</h2>
<p><a href="Mia_Ikumi" title="wikilink">Mia Ikumi</a> spent a year designing the <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em> <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> before the release of the first volume in February 2001.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The story she originally presented to her editors, <em>Tokyo Black Cat Girl</em>, featured a heroine named Princess Azumi who is given the ability to transform into a cat-girl by an intergalactic police officer named Masha. He then asks her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Baku using her new powers. Azumi agrees, while trying to keep her new double life secret from her crush.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character and the darker Princess Azumi was changed into the brighter and more colorful Ichigo. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Ikumi created other girl&lt;U+2013&gt;animal combinations while designing the four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Lettuce. However, the mouse design was one of several designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down.<ref name="Vol 1 p172<U+2013>173&quot; /&gt; Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack &quot;Strawberry Bell Bell&quot; as a joke, the editorial team thought it was funny and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The only character from Ikumi's <em>Tokyo Black Cat Girl</em> to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Mari Kitayama adapted the character designs from Ikumi's original artwork for the anime adaptation. Ikumi stated that she approved of the character designs, and agreed with the voice actor selections.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mew-mews">Mew Mews</h2>
<p>The Mew Mews are young girls who have been injected with the genes of <a href="endangered_species" title="wikilink">endangered species</a>, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. The superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the <a href="#Chimera_anima" title="wikilink">chimera anima</a>, the monsters created when alien <a href="parasite" title="wikilink">parasites</a> infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were the source of the chimera anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally; the head of the project, <a href="#Ryou_Shirogane" title="wikilink">Ryou Shirogane</a>, originally intended to inject a chimera anima with the endangered animal genes directly, to see if that would reverse the affects of the infection.{{#tag:ref|<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>|name=In the Beginning}}</p>
<p>The Mew Project was started by Ryou's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em> is set. The manga never explains why the project was started or how they knew about chimera animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal genes into human DNA in order to fight the aliens.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient <a href="civilization" class="uri" title="wikilink">civilization</a>, called the Chimera, during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of people who lived there, with his assistant <a href="#Keiichiro_Akasaka" title="wikilink">Keiichiro Akasaka</a>. This would eventually become the Mew Project.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A laboratory explosion kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryou orphaned. He moved to Japan, with Keiichiro, to continue the Mew Project.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to the anime, the lab explosion was caused by a Chimera fossil that woke up, setting the house on fire.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em>, there are five Mew Mews: Ichigo Momomiya, Mint Aizawa, Lettuce Midorikawa, Pudding Fong, and Zakuro Fujiwara.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>|name=Three Plus Two}} Each Mew Mew has a &quot;mew mark&quot; left on her body, identifying her as a Mew Mew. Each mark is unique to the girl, representing an aspect of their power, such as Mew Ichigo's mark, located on her inner thigh, being shaped like her Strawberry Bell Bell weapon, and Mew Mint's being a wing symbol on her back.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The girls have powers related to their animal DNA when transformed. They can also boost Mew Ichigo's power by combining their powers. The group were originally called the &quot;Mew Mews&quot;, until they were accidentally caught on live television and Mew Ichigo introduced the group to the viewers as &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot;. This became the name the public would call them thereafter.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As part of being Mew Mews, the girls work as waitresses at the Cafe Mew Mew, their headquarters, from where they gather information on chimera anima activity.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In <em>Tokyo Mew Mew a La Mode</em> Ichigo moves to England and a sixth Mew Mew, Berry Shirayuki, fills in for Ichigo as the leader of the Mew Mews.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

The transformation also causes her to exhibit various <a href="Felinae" title="wikilink">feline</a> mannerisms while in her human form.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> At first, her cat ears and tail appear when she is excited, but eventually her cat DNA grows strong enough that when she is very excited she turns into a small black cat.

The group comprises four teenagers and their leader Duke. In a flashback to the group's founding, Royal Highness, Happy Child, Blue Bayou and Sweet Juliet are said to have been born with varying special powers which resulted in their being shunned by other people and their families abandoning them by sending them away to a <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a> where they met.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The characters of <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em> have received praise from several publications for anime, manga, and other media. <em>Anime Fringe</em>{{'s}} Patrick King praised Ikumi's character designs for being a perfect first for the feel of the series, noting that &quot;one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist.&quot;<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> In <em><a href="Manga:_The_Complete_Guide" title="wikilink">Manga: The Complete Guide</a></em>, <a href="Shaenon_Garrity" title="wikilink">Shaenon Garrity</a> referred to the Mew Mews as &quot;cute girls in animal-themed lingerie&quot;.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>The new characters introduced in <em>Tokyo Mew Mew a La Mode</em> received more mixed reviews. Mania Entertainment's Mike Dungan found new Mew Mew Berry Shirayuki to be a &quot;fun character&quot; due to her energy and cheerfulness. He also found Tasuku to be a well-crafted complement, considering him &quot;an excellent complement to [Berry]&quot; and noting that his &quot;outgoing charm and clinginess ... is surprisingly never annoying.&quot;<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> However, Janet Crocker of <em>Anime Fringe</em> felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine that just mirrored the life Mew Ichigo (from the original <em>Tokyo Mew Mew</em>) in a shorter form and she dismissed the Saint Rose Crusaders' costumes and plans as being nothing more than concepts borrowed from <em>Sailor Moon</em>. She also criticized the specific design used for the character Duke, whose white robe she felt was too similar to those used by the <a href="white_supremacy" title="wikilink">white supremacy</a> group, the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> <a href="Anime_News_Network" title="wikilink">Anime News Network</a>'s Carlo Santos notes that &quot;Berry has the potential to become insufferable&quot;, but felt she acted more like a &quot;typical preteen girl&quot; who was &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;silly&quot; but &quot;stop[s] right before it gets annoying&quot;, thus avoiding being a standard &quot;marketable character trying to rack up charm points.&quot;<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
