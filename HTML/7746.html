<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Shin Getter Robo's first appearance was in 1995, in Super Robot Wars 4.</p>
<p>In <a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>, Shin Getter is Professor Saotome's ultimate creation during the prologue of the story. After breaking through a group of mass-produced <a href="Getter_Robo_G" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Gs</a>, <a href="Ryoma_Nagare" title="wikilink">Ryoma Nagare</a> and <a href="Hayato_Jin" title="wikilink">Hayato Jin</a> find it inside the Saotome Laboratory along with Go &quot;Saotome&quot;, the professor's genetically engineered &quot;son&quot;. When the trio learns that the military has launched a <a href="nuclear_warhead" title="wikilink">nuclear warhead</a> at the newly-formed Shin Dragon, they use Shin Getter in an attempt to stop the attack, but ultimately fail, causing a Getter Ray contamination that kills most of the planet's population. Several years later, when the story picks up again, Shin Getter is piloted by Go, Kei Kuruma (Getter teammate <a href="Benkei_Kuruma" title="wikilink">Benkei Kuruma</a>'s adopted daughter) and Gai. They use Shin Getter until Shin Dragon joins them willingly to fight the Invaders, at which point Ryoma, Hayato and Benkei take up the piloting duties for Shin Getter. The two Getters combine their energy to create incredible attacks, capable of destroying <a href="Jupiter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> and its Invader-infected moons, but Shin Getter ends up stranded in another dimension, fighting alongside Getters from other universes for all eternity.</p>
<p>In <a href="Shin_Getter_Robo_vs_Neo_Getter_Robo" title="wikilink">Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo</a>, Shin Getter is once more the ultimate Getter. It was going to be used to fight the Dinosaur Empire, but was unable to activate without sufficient willpower from its pilots. After the Empire's defeat (at the cost of <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>), the Japanese government puts an end to Getter Energy research, causing Shin Getter to be locked down in the now abandoned Saotome Lab. Five years later, the Dinosaur Empire attacks again, planning to destroy Shin Getter before the new Getter Team can use it. Thanks to the combined efforts of the team, Saotome, Hayato and a newly-returned Ryoma, Shin Getter is activated and replaces Neo Getter as the Earth's primary defense against the Dinosaurs. In the final battle, the united willpower of the Getter Team causes Shin Getter to metamorphose into a new form (dubbed &quot;God Getter Robo&quot;), defeating Emperor Gol in a single blow. Despite this, the Neo Getter version of Shin Getter Robo is considered one of its weaker forms; it displays no special attacks other than Getter Beam and a polearm tomahawk, and it is never tested against high-power enemies.</p>
<p>In its many appearances in the <a href="Super_Robot_Wars" title="wikilink">Super Robot Wars</a> series, Shin Getter is simply treated as an upgrade for the original Getter, much in the same fashion that <a href="Gundam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gundam</a> characters upgrade from one <a href="mobile_suit" title="wikilink">mobile suit</a> to a stronger one. The primary exception to this is the games that make use of <a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>, <a href="Shin_Getter_Robo_vs_Neo_Getter_Robo" title="wikilink">Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo</a>, and once even the manga version.</p>
<p>In Nagai's manga, Shin Getter is literally given to mankind by <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> as its protection against malevolent aliens. However, it is no longer the strongest Getter, since it has to compete with its successor Getter Ark and the planet-sized Getter Emperors.</p>

<p><em>Note: Like <a href="Mazinkaiser_(robot)" title="wikilink">Mazinkaiser</a>, Shin Getter's attacks and abilities vary from appearance to appearance; as such, each attack will be labed according to its appearances.</em></p>
<h3 id="shin-getter-1">Shin Getter-1</h3>
<p><strong>Height</strong>: 55 meters (<a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>)<br />
<strong>Weight</strong>: 290 tons (<a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>)<br />
<strong>Construction</strong>: Polyformic Ally (<a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>)<br />
<strong>Power Source</strong>: Getter Core<br />
Pilots: <a href="Ryoma_Nagare" title="wikilink">Ryoma Nagare</a> (Super Robot Wars, Armageddon, manga), Go Saotome (Armageddon), Go Ichimonji (Shin vs Neo)</p>
<p>Weapons and Attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm Cutter (all versions): The large serrated blades on Shin Getter-1's forearms can be used as melee weapons.</li>
<li>Tomahawk Boomerang (all versions): Shin Getter-1 can throw its tomahawk as a boomerang-type weapon. In the anime versions, it throws the whole tomahawk, while its appearance in the last two games of the Super Robot Wars Alpha series have it simply throwing the head.</li>
<li>Getter Blaster Cannon (Super Robot Wars): A hand-held <a href="beam" class="uri" title="wikilink">beam</a> gun.</li>
<li>Getter Lancer (Armageddon): An improvised attack, Go simply turned the Getter Tomahawk around and used the sharp spike at the end of its shaft as a <a href="spear" class="uri" title="wikilink">spear</a>.</li>
<li>Getter Tomahawk (all versions): The primary melee weapon of the Getter series has always been the <a href="Tomahawk_(axe)" title="wikilink">tomahawk</a>. However, Shin Getter-1's version is a bit of a misnomer, since the weapon in question is a two-headed battle axe with a very long handle. In <a href="Shin_Getter_Robo_vs_Neo_Getter_Robo" title="wikilink">Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo</a>, the tomahawk was called <em>Getter Tomahawk Lancer</em>, possibly in reference to the Getter Lancer attack.</li>
<li>Getter Scythe (Armageddon): Contained in the bud on Shin Getter-1's right shoulder is a scythe of similar style to the Getter Tomahawk.</li>
<li>Getter Beam (all versions): A beam of focused Getter Energy released from Shin Getter-1's chest. Getter Energy is especially detrimental to <a href="reptile" title="wikilink">reptilian</a> lifeforms, causing Dinosaurs to melt and eventually die, and causing the de-<a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> of Invaders. The Armageddon version of Shin Getter-1 has a weaker secondary Getter Beam, which is fired from its forehead.</li>
<li>Stoner Sunshine (Super Robot Wars, Armageddon): Shin Getter-1 gathers a ball of energy in its hands, eventually growing to incredible size before it's thrown at the enemy. This is Shin Getter's strongest attack in many of its forms. Though the Neo Getter version never uses it in the anime, the <a href="Super_Robot_Wars" title="wikilink">Super Robot Wars</a> games give the attack to its God Getter form.</li>
<li>Final Getter Crusher (Shin vs Neo): The only attack officially used by God Getter. It punches its arm into the enemy, then fills it full of energy, causing the arm to expand before the energy is released into the victim.</li>
<li>Shin Shine Spark (Super Robot Wars): An improved version of <a href="Getter_Robo_G" title="wikilink">Getter Robo G</a>'s Shine Spark attack. Shin Getter charges its body full of energy, then flies headlong into the enemy, releasing the energy before flying away to safety. This attack is often given to other Getters, such Shin Getter Dragon in the game <em>Getter Robo Daikessen</em>. In <a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>, Shin Shine Spark is a joint attack that requires Shin Getter and Shin Dragon to link their power systems before it can be used.</li>

<li>Drill Missile (all versions): The massive drill arm can be fired as a projectile, drilling its way through an enemy before flying back to the Getter.</li>
<li>Drill Tempest (all versions): Shin Getter-2 spins its drill arm at incredible speeds, generating a cyclone that buffets the enemy. This attack is also called <em>Drill Hurricane</em> in some media.</li>

<li>Drill Arm: Shin Getter-2 uses its powerful thrusters to fly at the enemy at top speed before ramming its rapidly-spinning drill arm into them, causing massive damage.</li>

<li>Getter Missile Bomb (all versions): Shin Getter-3 also mounts countless powerful missiles in its large rear section, released all at once. In <a href="Getter_Robo_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Getter Robo Armageddon</a>, this attack is called <em>Missile Storm</em>.</li>
<li>Shin Daisetsuzan Oroshi (Armageddon): An improved version of Musashi's <a href="Judo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judo</a> throw, first employed by Getter-3. Shin Getter-3 uses its extendable arms to grab the enemy, then spins them around over its head at incredible speeds, disorienting them before throwing them high into the sky and letting them come crashing down to Earth.</li>
<li>Daisetsuzan Oroshi - Ni-Dan Gaeshi (Super Robot Wars): Appearing in the Super Robot Wars Alpha series, this attack is mostly identical to the Shin Daisetsuzan Oroshi. The main difference is that after throwing its opponent, Shin Getter-3 fires the Missile Bomb attack straight up, further battering the helpless enemy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="related-machines">Related Machines</h2>
<h3 id="shin-getter-machines">Shin Getter Machines</h3>
<p>As with most versions of Getter Robo, Shin Getter is composed of three jet-like vehicles piloted by one of the three pilots. <strong>Shin Eagle</strong> is the red jet, controlled by the pilot of Shin Getter-1. <strong>Shin Jaguar</strong>, the white jet, is used by Shin Getter-2's pilot. Shin Getter-3's operator uses <strong>Shin Bear</strong>, the yellow machine. All three are armed with missiles, but are generally very weak and never used in combat unless absolutely necessary. They also appear when the pilots use the <em>Open Gate</em> verbal command to break up the current form, so that they can change into another or so they can dodge an enemy's attack.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p>Shin Getter Robo makes a sort of cameo appearance in <a href="New_Getter_Robo" title="wikilink">New Getter Robo</a> as one of the multi-dimensional Getters sent to attack the heroes of that series. The appearance is brief, followed by a quick shot of Shin Getter being destroyed. Some fans feel that this underscores New Getter's power, as it can do by itself feats that required Shin Getter to team up with Shin Dragon.</p>
