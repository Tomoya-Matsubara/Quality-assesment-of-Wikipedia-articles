<p><strong>New York State Route 239</strong> (also known as NY 239) was a state highway in <a href="Erie_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Erie County</a>. It began at an intersection with <a href="New_York_State_Route_354" title="wikilink">New York State Route 354</a> in <a href="Cowlesville,_New_York" title="wikilink">Cowlesville</a>. The route headed northward, ending at <a href="U.S._Route_20_in_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 20</a> in <a href="Alden_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">Alden</a>. The entirety of NY 239 was only about  in length. However, when first assigned in the <a href="1930_New_York_State_Route_renumbering" title="wikilink">1930 New York State Route renumbering</a>, NY 239 stretched into nearby <a href="Wyoming_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Wyoming County</a>. The route was truncated to NY 354 in Cowlesville, and was eventually decommissioned in September 1980, following a maintenance swap several months before. The designation was replaced by Erie County Route 578.</p>

<p>Route 239 began at an intersection with <a href="New_York_State_Route_354" title="wikilink">New York State Route 354</a> in Cowlesville. The route then traveled to the northeast and climbed in elevation just after the terminus. The highway then made a turn to the north, descending in elevation. Running at about a height of  above sea level, Route 239 crosses into the town of Alden and continues towards downtown.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Route 239 continued northward, passing nearby Henskee Road, which headed eastward and terminated at the Genesee County line. The route dipped in elevation, entering the village of Alden. where nearby, the Buffalo Water Filtration Plant sat to the west as the road traveled across the <a href="Conrail" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conrail</a> tracks. Route 239 passed through a, primarily, residential area just before terminating at <a href="U.S._Route_20_in_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 20</a> in Alden.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
