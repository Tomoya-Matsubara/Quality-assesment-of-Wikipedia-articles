<p><strong>Brill railway station</strong> was the terminus of a small railway line in <a href="Buckinghamshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buckinghamshire</a>, England, known as the <a href="Brill_Tramway" title="wikilink">Brill Tramway</a>. Built and owned by the <a href="Richard_Temple-Grenville,_3rd_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Chandos" title="wikilink">Duke of Buckingham</a>, it was later operated by <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>'s <a href="Metropolitan_Railway" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Railway</a> and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London Underground</a>, despite being  and over two hours travel from the <a href="City_of_London" title="wikilink">City of London</a>.</p>
<p>Approximately  of a mile (1.2 km) north of <a href="Brill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brill</a>, the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. Cheaply built and <a href="Land_grading" title="wikilink">ungraded</a> and using poor quality <a href="locomotive" title="wikilink">locomotives</a>, services on the line were very slow, taking 1 hour 45 minutes to travel the six miles (10 km) from Brill to the <a href="junction_station" title="wikilink">junction station</a> with mainline services at <a href="Quainton_Road_railway_station" title="wikilink">Quainton Road</a>. Although serving a lightly populated area and little used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a supplier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to <a href="Aylesbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aylesbury</a> and London. A <a href="brickworks" class="uri" title="wikilink">brickworks</a> was also attached to the station, but proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.</p>
<p>In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899 to become one of the railway's two north-western termini. The line was upgraded and better quality locomotives were introduced, reducing the journey time to Quainton Road by almost two-thirds.</p>
<p>In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the <a href="Metropolitan_Line" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Line</a> of <a href="London_Passenger_Transport_Board" title="wikilink">London Transport</a>. London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction and subsequently demolished. The site of the station is now a light industrial development known as &quot;Tramway Business Park&quot;.</p>

<p>On 23 September 1868 the small <a href="Aylesbury_and_Buckingham_Railway" title="wikilink">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&amp;BR) opened, linking the <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a>'s station at <a href="Aylesbury_railway_station" title="wikilink">Aylesbury</a> to the <a href="London_and_North_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity_Line" title="wikilink">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney_Junction_railway_station" title="wikilink">Verney Junction</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On 1 September 1894 London's <a href="Metropolitan_Railway" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and shortly afterwards connected to the A&amp;BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker_Street_tube_station" title="wikilink">Baker Street</a> commenced on 1 January 1897.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and owing to the town's hilltop setting the station was  of a mile (1.2 km) from the town itself.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Brill railway station was a small station with a single low platform.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> At the time of opening, there was a single station building which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal and ticket office;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> adjacent to the building was a siding leading to a <a href="cattle_pen" title="wikilink">cattle pen</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single <a href="Brown,_Marshalls_and_Co._Ltd." title="wikilink">Brown Marshall</a> passenger carriage on the line;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="passenger-services">Passenger services</h3>
<p>From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Limited by poor quality locomotives and <a href="Land_grading" title="wikilink">ungraded</a>, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains 1 hour 45 minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the <a href="junction_station" title="wikilink">junction station</a> at Quainton Road.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Serving a lightly populated area and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little passenger use; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at <a href="Wood_Siding_railway_station" title="wikilink">Wood Siding</a>) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only &lt;U+00A3&gt;191 (about &lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ) in passenger receipts.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="goods-facilities">Goods facilities</h3>
<p>Although little used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of <a href="Brackley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brackley</a> and Aylesbury, while bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of <a href="Waddesdon_Manor" title="wikilink">Waddesdon Manor</a>, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir <a href="William_Temple-Gore-Langton,_4th_Earl_Temple_of_Stowe" title="wikilink">William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe</a> expanded the brickworks into the Brill Brick &amp; Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the mainline at Quainton Road.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick &amp; Tile Works proved unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at <a href="Calvert,_Buckinghamshire" title="wikilink">Calvert</a>, and the brickworks soon closed.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In 1899 the <a href="Great_Central_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Central Railway</a> mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert.
