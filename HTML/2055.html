In 1857, at 36 years old, he was inaugurated as <a href="James_Buchanan" title="wikilink">James Buchanan</a>'s <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">vice president</a>, and remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of <a href="Southern_Democrats" title="wikilink">Southern Democrats</a>, but <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1860" title="wikilink">lost the election</a> to the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> candidate, <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a>.</p>
<p>A member of the <a href="Breckinridge_family" title="wikilink">Breckinridge political family</a>, in 1849 John C.

A champion of <a href="strict_constructionism" title="wikilink">strict constructionism</a>, <a href="states&#39;_rights" title="wikilink">states' rights</a>, and <a href="popular_sovereignty" title="wikilink">popular sovereignty</a>, he supported <a href="Stephen_A._Douglas" title="wikilink">Stephen A.

Considering his re-election to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a> unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the <a href="1856_Democratic_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1856 Democratic National Convention</a>, and although he and Buchanan <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1856" title="wikilink">won the election</a>, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.</p>
<p>In 1859, the <a href="Kentucky_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">Kentucky General Assembly</a> elected Breckinridge to a <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a> term that would begin in 1861.

Lincoln's election as president prompted the <a href="Secession_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">secession</a> of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the <a href="Battle_of_Fort_Sumter" title="wikilink">Confederates fired on Fort Sumter</a>, beginning the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the <a href="Confederate_States_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate States Army</a>, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when <a href="President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson_Davis" title="wikilink">Jefferson Davis</a> appointed him <a href="Confederate_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Confederate States Secretary of War</a>. Concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture in April 1865 ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, then <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>, and finally <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, remaining in exile until President <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a>'s offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875.</p>
