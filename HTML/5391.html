<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>
<p>The story follows the un-named <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> and his irrational hatred of John Claverhouse, a man with a &quot;moon-face&quot;. The protagonist clearly states that his hatred of him is <a href="irrational" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrational</a>, saying: <em>&quot;Why do we not like him? Ah, we do not know why; we know only that we do not. We have taken a dislike, that is all. And so I with John Claverhouse.&quot;</em> The protagonist becomes obsessed with Claverhouse, hating his face, his laugh, his entire life. The protagonist observes that Claverhouse engages in <a href="illegal_fishing" title="wikilink">illegal fishing</a> with <a href="dynamite" class="uri" title="wikilink">dynamite</a> and hatches a scheme to kill Claverhouse.</p>
<p>The protagonist teaches a dog, Bellona, to do one thing and one thing only, <a href="retriever" title="wikilink">retrieval</a>, with empahsis on water retrieving and taking the stick back to the thrower no matter where they were. Claverhouse is presented with Bellona before his upcoming <a href="trout" class="uri" title="wikilink">trout</a> fishing trip. The protagonist observes from a distance with glee as Claverhouse lights a stick of dynamite and throws it into the water. Bellona, trained to retrieve, fetches the explosive. Claverhouse runs from the dog in futility until <em>&quot;just as she caught up, he in full stride, and she leaping with nose at his knee, there was a sudden flash, a burst of smoke, a terrific detonation, and where man and dog had been the instant before there was naught to be seen but a big hole in the ground.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The death is ruled an accident while engaged in illegal fishing. The protagonist takes pride in killing Claverhouse with no mess or brutality and lives in peace.</p>
