<p>The <strong>San Diego and Arizona Railway</strong> was a <a href="short_line" title="wikilink">short line</a> <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a>  founded by &quot;sugar heir,&quot; developer, and entrepreneur <a href="John_D._Spreckels" title="wikilink">John D. Spreckels</a>, and dubbed <strong>&quot;The Impossible Railroad&quot;</strong> by many engineers of its day due to the immense logistical challenges involved. Established in part to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinetal rail link to the east by connecting with the <a href="Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> (which secretly provided the funding for the endeavor) lines in <a href="El_Centro" title="wikilink">El Centro</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, the 148-<a href="mile" class="uri" title="wikilink">mile</a> (238-<a href="kilometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">kilometer</a>) route of the SD&amp;A originated in <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> and terminated in the <a href="Imperial_County" title="wikilink">Imperial County</a> town of <a href="Calexico,_California" title="wikilink">Calexico</a>.</p>
<p>The company charter was executed on <a href="December_14" title="wikilink">December 14</a>, <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a>, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on the following September. Numerous delays (including government intervention during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>) delayed the completion of the line to <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>, <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a>. Damage to the lines from both natural disasters and sabotage exerted great financial pressure on the company, and in <a href="1932" class="uri" title="wikilink">1932</a> Spreckels' heirs sold their interests in the railroad to the Southern Pacific, which was theafter named the <a href="San_Diego_and_Arizona_Eastern_Railway" title="wikilink">San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway</a> (SD&amp;AE).</p>

<p>The company was chartered on <a href="December_14" title="wikilink">December 14</a>, <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a>, and groundbreaking ceremonies held at the intersection of San Diego's Main and 26th Streets on <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a>, <a href="1907" class="uri" title="wikilink">1907</a>. Construction delays, attacks by <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> revolutionaries, and government intervention during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> all served to push the construction completion to <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>, <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a> when the &quot;golden spike&quot; was finally driven by none other than John Spreckels himself.</p>
<p><img src="SDA_Golden_Spike_November_15_1919.jpg" title="fig:J.D. Spreckels drives the &quot;golden spike&quot; to ceremonially complete the San Diego and Arizona Railway on November 15, 1919." alt="J.D. Spreckels drives the &quot;golden spike&quot; to ceremonially complete the San Diego and Arizona Railway on November 15, 1919." width="300" /> The first through SD&amp;A <a href="passenger_train" title="wikilink">passenger train</a> left Campo on the morning of <a href="December_30" title="wikilink">December 30</a>, and made the full run from El Centro to San Diego's downtown <a href="Union_Station_(San_Diego)" title="wikilink">Union Station</a> for the official opening of the line on <a href="December_1" title="wikilink">December 1</a>, 1919. The total construction cost of the 146.4 miles of track laid was approximately $18 million, or some $123,000 per mile; the original estimate was $6 million. The 11-mile long segment through <a href="Carrizo_Gorge" title="wikilink">Carrizo Gorge</a> (which included 13,385 feet of tunnels, 17 in all) alone cost over $4 million to construct; the three miles of tunnels (21 total) along the entire line ran another $1.8 million. Almost 2.5 miles of bridges and trestles were built as well.</p>
<p>The tracks departed downtown San Diego south where they crossed the <a href="U.S.-Mexico_border" title="wikilink">U.S.-Mexico border</a> at <a href="San_Ysidro,_California" title="wikilink">San Ysidro</a>. From there the line traversed eastward through <a href="Tijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tijuana</a>, then headed northeast through <a href="Tecate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tecate</a> and back over the border to the town of <a href="Campo,_California" title="wikilink">Campo</a>. To construct and maintain the 44-mile (72 kilometer) stretch through <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> the <em>SD&amp;A</em> formed the <strong>Tijuana and Tecate Railway</strong>, at the behest of the Mexican government. East of Campo the road traveled through Clover Flats, across the Coast Range (elevation 3,660 feet), then descended through the breathtaking but treacherous <a href="Carrizo_Gorge" title="wikilink">Carrizo Gorge</a>, the builders' most significant obstacle. Though the SD&amp;A line ended in <a href="Seeley,_California" title="wikilink">Seeley</a>, trackage rights gave the railroad the ability to run trains as far east as El Centro and as far south as <a href="Calexico,_California" title="wikilink">Calexico</a>. Branch lines ran from downtown to as far north and east as the community of <a href="Lakeside,_California" title="wikilink">Lakeside</a>, with a separate line which circumvented San Diego Bay to service <a href="Coronado,_California" title="wikilink">Coronado Heights</a>, <a href="Coronado,_California" title="wikilink">Coronado</a>, and North Island.</p>
<p>Damage to the lines from heavy rainstorms, landslides, and fires took a financial toll on the railroad, as did border closings with Mexico. Clashes with the <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" title="wikilink">IWW</a> resulted in acts of vandalism as well. In <a href="1932" class="uri" title="wikilink">1932</a>, financial difficulties forced Spreckels' heirs to sell their interests in the firm for $2.8 million to the Southern Pacific, which renamed the railroad the <a href="San_Diego_and_Arizona_Eastern_Railway" title="wikilink">San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway</a> (SD&amp;AE).</p>
