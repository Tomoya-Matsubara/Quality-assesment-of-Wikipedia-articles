<p>Walpack Township dates back to October 26, 1731, when it was first mentioned as <em>Walpake</em> in <a href="Hunterdon_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hunterdon County</a>. The area covered by the present-day township was set off to <a href="Morris_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Morris County</a> upon that county's creation in 1739, and became part of the newly formed Sussex County in 1753. As of April 15, 1754, Walpack's boundaries were defined as a &quot;precinct&quot;. Walpack was formally incorporated as a township by an Act of the <a href="New_Jersey_Legislature" title="wikilink">New Jersey Legislature</a> on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form <a href="Montague_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Montague Township</a> (March 26, 1759), <a href="Sandyston_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Sandyston Township</a> (February 26, 1762) and the now-defunct <a href="Pahaquarry_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Pahaquarry Township</a> in <a href="Warren_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Warren County</a> (December 27, 1824).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The current Walpack Township is named from a corruption of the <a href="Lenape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lenape</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> word &quot;wahlpeck,&quot; which means &quot;turn-hole,&quot; or an <a href="eddy_(fluid_dynamics)" title="wikilink">eddy</a> or <a href="whirlpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">whirlpool</a>. This word is a compound of two Native American words, &quot;woa-lac&quot; (a hole), and &quot;tuppeck&quot; (a pool).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
