<p><strong>Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">GCB</a> <a href="Royal_Victorian_Order" title="wikilink">CVO</a> <a href="King&#39;s_Counsel" title="wikilink">KC</a> (22 August 1869 &lt;U+2013&gt; 28 June 1956) was a British <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a> and civil servant noted for his long tenure as <a href="Permanent_Secretary_to_the_Lord_Chancellor&#39;s_Office" title="wikilink">Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office</a>. Born to a middle-class <a href="Mancunian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mancunian</a> family, Schuster was educated at <a href="St._George&#39;s_School,_Ascot" title="wikilink">St. George's School, Ascot</a> and <a href="Winchester_College" title="wikilink">Winchester College</a> before matriculating to <a href="New_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">New College, Oxford</a> in 1888 to study history. After graduation he joined the <a href="Inner_Temple" title="wikilink">Inner Temple</a> with the aim of becoming a barrister, and was <a href="Call_to_the_Bar" title="wikilink">called to the Bar</a> in 1895. Practising in Liverpool, Schuster was not noted as a particularly successful barrister, and he joined <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Civil_Service" title="wikilink">Her Majesty's Civil Service</a> in 1899 as secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Local Government Act Commission.</p>
<p>After serving as secretary to several more commissions, he was made Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office in 1915. Schuster served in this position for 29 years under ten different Lord Chancellors, and with the contacts obtained thanks to his long tenure and his work outside the Office he became &quot;one of the most influential Permanent Secretaries of the 20th century&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His influence over decisions within the Lord Chancellor's Office and greater Civil Service led to criticism and suspicions that he was a &quot;power behind the throne&quot;, which culminated in a verbal attack by the <a href="Lord_Chief_Justice" title="wikilink">Lord Chief Justice</a> <a href="Gordon_Hewart,_1st_Viscount_Hewart" title="wikilink">Lord Hewart</a> in 1934 during a session of the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>. Schuster retired in 1944 and was made Baron Schuster of Cerne, in the County of Dorset. Despite being officially retired he continued to work in government circles, such as with the <a href="Allied_Commission_for_Austria" title="wikilink">Allied Commission for Austria</a> and by using his seat in the House of Lords as a way to directly criticise legislation.</p>

<p>Schuster entered the Civil Service in 1899 and as a qualified lawyer was exempt from the required examinations, something that marked him as &quot;different&quot; from other civil service employees with whom he worked.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> His first post was as secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Local Government Act Commission, which produced a report leading to the creation of the <a href="London_County_Council" title="wikilink">London County Council</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After this he worked as a secretary to the <a href="Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">Great Northern Railway</a> and then for the workers' union at London &amp; Smith's Bank Ltd. After his job at the union he was noticed by <a href="Robert_Laurie_Morant" title="wikilink">Robert Morant</a> who employed him as a temporary legal assistant to the <a href="Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Board of Education</a> on the understanding that the job would become permanent, which it did in 1907.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 1911 he was promoted to Principal Assistant Secretary, and after Morant was appointed to the English Commission under the <a href="National_Insurance_Act_1911" title="wikilink">National Insurance Act 1911</a> Schuster followed him by being appointed Chief Registrar of the <a href="Friendly_Societies" title="wikilink">Friendly Societies</a>, which granted him a place on the Societies' committee.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1912 he gave up his position as Chief Registrar to become Secretary (and then legal adviser) to the English Insurance Commission, with the newspapers of the time reporting that he had had &quot;three promotions in two months&quot;, a consequence of his high standing with Morant.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> During this period he was also involved in drafting education bills with <a href="Arthur_Thring" title="wikilink">Arthur Thring</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The commission was &quot;a galaxy of future Whitehall stars&quot;,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and contained many individuals who would later become noted civil servants in their own right, including Morant, Schuster, <a href="John_Anderson,_1st_Viscount_Waverley" title="wikilink">John Anderson</a>, <a href="Warren_Fisher" title="wikilink">Warren Fisher</a> and <a href="John_Bradbury,_1st_Baron_Bradbury" title="wikilink">John Bradbury</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The contacts Schuster made during his time on the committee were instrumental in advancing his career; as a lawyer rather than a dedicated civil servant he was considered an outsider, and the links he made &lt;U+2013&gt; particularly the friendships he struck up with Fisher and Anderson &lt;U+2013&gt; helped allay this to some extent.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>He was knighted in 1913 for his services on various committees.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

The current Lord Chancellor <a href="Richard_Haldane,_1st_Viscount_Haldane" title="wikilink">Lord Haldane</a> believed that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor for a second time in 1924;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>The first Lord Chancellor under whom Schuster served was <a href="Stanley_Buckmaster,_1st_Viscount_Buckmaster" title="wikilink">Lord Buckmaster</a>, who was appointed on 27 May 1915.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Although most senior government offices at this time were held by wealthy aristocrats, the office of Lord Chancellor stood out as most of the appointees were lawyers from the middle class.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Buckmaster was considered &quot;the most <a href="Plebs" title="wikilink">plebeian</a> of Lord Chancellors&quot;, as he was the son of a farmer and schoolteacher who later became a <a href="Justice_of_the_Peace" title="wikilink">Justice of the Peace</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Schuster became Permanent Secretary in July, a month after Buckmaster took his post, and immediately tried to make an impression on the workings of the office by modernising it; under the previous Permanent Secretary &lt;U+2013&gt; who abhorred time-saving mechanisms &lt;U+2013&gt; shorthand had been forbidden, and the office had owned only one typewriter.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Buckmaster and Schuster had similar outlooks on <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, with both their sons serving on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>; Schuster almost certainly helped write the 1915 memorandum Buckmaster circulated to the Westminster <a href="Cabinet_(government)" title="wikilink">Cabinet</a> arguing that forces should be concentrated on the Western Front rather than spread out in an attempt to assault other areas.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="H._H._Asquith" title="wikilink">H. H.

<p>Finlay had been appointed on the conditions that he would not claim a pension (it was war-time, and there were already four retired Lord Chancellors claiming &lt;U+00A3&gt;5000 per year pensions) and that he would resign when required.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Despite this he was surprised when he was dismissed after the 1919 general election, first hearing about it when it was mentioned in the newspapers.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> His replacement <a href="F._E._Smith,_1st_Earl_of_Birkenhead" title="wikilink">Lord Birkenhead</a> was appointed on 14 January 1919, and was a controversial choice; he was only 46 when appointed and was unpopular with large sections of the Bar as a result; <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George V</a> himself wrote to the Prime Minister before Birkenhead was appointed and said that &quot;His Majesty does not feel sure that [Birkenhead] has established such a reputation in men's minds as to ensure that the country will welcome him to the second highest position which can be occupied by a subject of the Crown&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Birkenhead and Schuster established a strong partnership, and Schuster played a part in instituting Birkenhead's legal reforms, particularly those relating to the <a href="Real_property" title="wikilink">law of real property</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Real property law in the English and Welsh legal system had evolved from <a href="feudalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudalism</a>, and was an immensely complex system understood by only a small number of lawyers.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved, something partially rectified by the <a href="Settled_Land_Act_1882" title="wikilink">Settled Land Act 1882</a> and the Land Transfer Act 1897.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed, and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913, 1914 and 1915 with no real progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under <a href="Leslie_Scott_(UK_politician)" title="wikilink">Sir Leslie Scott</a> was created to consider land policy after the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, and Schuster (who had <a href="Devil_(legal)" title="wikilink">devilled</a> for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool) was appointed as a member.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The subcommittee decided that the law should be changed to merge <a href="real_property" title="wikilink">real</a> and <a href="personal_property" title="wikilink">personal property</a> law, and that outdated aspects of land law such as <a href="copyhold" title="wikilink">copyholds</a> and <a href="gavelkind" class="uri" title="wikilink">gavelkind</a> should be eliminated.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law, and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Although there was general agreement that property law should be reformed the process was made more difficult by the various vested interests involved; the Law Society, for example, was opposed to the changes because it would reduce the fees dedicated property solicitors could earn by making it possible for more solicitors to understand that area of law and become involved.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> After intense negotiation Schuster and the Law Society representative agreed that a &quot;period of probation&quot; lasting three years would be included in the bill, which <a href="Charles_Brickdale" title="wikilink">Charles Brickdale</a> the Chief Registrar of <a href="HM_Land_Registry" title="wikilink">HM Land Registry</a> considered &quot;a very good bargain&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> When the bill finally got to the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> it met additional opposition from Members of Parliament who were also members of the Law Society and Bar Council, as well as <a href="George_Cave,_1st_Viscount_Cave" title="wikilink">Lord Cave</a> who later became Lord Chancellor.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> After further negotiations the bill was passed on 8 June 1922, with Birkenhead taking the credit, and it became the Law of Property Act 1922.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
