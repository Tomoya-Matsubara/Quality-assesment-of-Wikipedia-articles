After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> he began a long and productive career with the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, where his ready wit, musicianship and broad musical knowledge made him much sought after as a musical accompanist for panel games and magazine shows, such as <em>Whirligig</em> and <em><a href="Many_a_Slip" title="wikilink">Many a Slip</a></em>. In 1949 his jazz group recorded the first British <a href="bebop" class="uri" title="wikilink">bebop</a> records.</p>
<h2 id="presenter">Presenter</h2>
<p>From the 1950s to the 1980s he presented countless music programmes on <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> and <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a>.

One of his better-known compositions is the short melodic piano instrumental &quot;Nicola&quot; (named after his daughter). His catchy &quot;Pied Piper&quot; (The Beeje) was also popular and reached number 29 in the charts in March 1963, but his best-known and, according to his autobiography, his most lucrative composition is his music for the <a href="Birds_Eye" title="wikilink">Birds Eye</a> frozen peas <a href="jingle" class="uri" title="wikilink">jingle</a>, &quot;Sweet as the moment when the pod went pop&quot;.</p>
