<p><strong>Route 147</strong> is a  <a href="New_Jersey_State_Route" title="wikilink">state highway</a> located in <a href="Cape_May_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Cape May County</a> in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. It is a short connector between <a href="U.S._Route_9_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 9</a> in <a href="Middle_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Middle Township</a> and <a href="North_Wildwood,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">North Wildwood</a> at New York Avenue. West of U.S. Route 9, the road continues to <a href="New_Jersey_Route_47" title="wikilink">Route 47</a> as <a href="County_Route_618_(Cape_May_County,_New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">County Route 618</a> (Indian Trail Road); this route along with Route 147 provides an alternate route to <a href="The_Wildwoods" title="wikilink">The Wildwoods</a> from Route 47. East of New York Avenue, the route continues south through The Wildwoods as <a href="County_Route_621_(Cape_May_County,_New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">County Route 621</a> (New Jersey Avenue). The route passes through mostly marshland along its journey, intersecting the <a href="Garden_State_Parkway" title="wikilink">Garden State Parkway</a> at a partial interchange and County Route 619 (<a href="Ocean_Drive_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Ocean Drive</a>). The portion of the route east of the intersection with the latter forms a part of Ocean Drive. When the <a href="List_of_500-series_county_routes_in_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">500-series county routes</a> were established in New Jersey in the 1950s, what is now Route 147 became a part of <a href="County_Route_585_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">County Route 585</a>, a route running from <a href="Lower_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Lower Township</a> north to <a href="Absecon,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Absecon</a>. Route 147 was designated along County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 and the North Wildwood border. The route was extended to its current location in North Wildwood by the 1990s.</p>
