The chain is located in <a href="Mono_County,_California" title="wikilink">Mono County</a> in the <a href="U.S._State" title="wikilink">U.S. State</a> of California. <strong>Mono Lake Volcanic Field</strong> forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one <a href="cinder_cone" title="wikilink">cinder cone</a> volcano on its northwest shore. Most of the <strong>Mono Craters</strong>, which make up the bulk of the northern part of the Mono-Inyo chain, are <a href="phreatic_eruption" title="wikilink">phreatic</a> (steam explosion) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over-topped by <a href="rhyolite" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhyolite</a> domes and lava flows. <strong>Inyo Craters</strong> form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits, and rhyolitic lava flows and domes. The southernmost part of the chain consists of <a href="fumarole" title="wikilink">fumaroles</a> and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and of a set of cinder cones south of the mountain; the latter set is called the <a href="Red_Cones" title="wikilink">Red Cones</a>.</p>
<p>Eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of <a href="Long_Valley_Caldera" title="wikilink">Long Valley Caldera</a> 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of <a href="Paoha_Island" title="wikilink">Paoha Island</a> in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large <a href="magma_chamber" title="wikilink">magma chamber</a> like the one that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity along the chain.</p>
<p>The area has been used by humans for centuries. <a href="Obsidian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Obsidian</a> was collected by <a href="Mono_tribe" title="wikilink">Mono Paiutes</a> for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. <a href="Mono_Mills,_California" title="wikilink">Mono Mills</a> processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown <a href="Bodie,_California" title="wikilink">Bodie</a> in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the <a href="Los_Angeles_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Aqueduct</a> system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and a large part of Mono Craters gained some protection under <a href="Mono_Basin_National_Forest_Scenic_Area" title="wikilink">Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area</a> in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the <a href="United_States_Forest_Service" title="wikilink">United States Forest Service</a> as part of <a href="Inyo_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Inyo National Forest</a>.

<p>The chain of craters has been the subject of several writers and naturalists. <a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a> visited Mono Basin in the 1860s and wrote about Mono Lake, but did not mention any of the Mono-Inyo Craters except for the lake's two volcanic islands. He wrote in <em><a href="Roughing_It" title="wikilink">Roughing It</a></em> (1872) that the lake was in a &quot;lifeless, hideous desert ...&quot; that was the &quot;loneliest spot on earth ... little graced with the picturesque.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

He described the &quot;Mono Desert&quot; as a &quot;... country of wonderful contrasts. Hot deserts bounded by snow-laden mountains,&lt;U+2014&gt;cinders and ashes scattered on glacier-polished pavements,&lt;U+2014&gt;frost and fire working together in the making of beauty. In the lake are several volcanic islands, which show that the waters were once mingled with fire.&quot; <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Muir described the Mono Craters as &quot;... heaps of loose ashes that have never been blest by either rain or snow ...&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1881 and the fall of 1882, geologist <a href="Israel_Russell" title="wikilink">Israel Russell</a> studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of <a href="Lake_Lahontan" title="wikilink">Lake Lahontan</a>; a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last <a href="glacial_period" title="wikilink">glacial period</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> His <em>Quaternary History of the Mono Valley</em> (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D.

<p>Russell named the Mono Craters and wrote; &quot;The attention of every one who enters Mono Valley is at once attracted by the soft, pleasing colors of these craters as well as by the symmetry and beauty of their forms. They are exceptional features in the scenery of the region, and are rendered all the more striking by their proximity to the angular peaks and rugged outlines of the High Sierra.&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p>Severe damage from super-heated flows of gas, ash and pulverized rock (<a href="pyroclastic_flow" title="wikilink">pyroclastic flows</a> and surges) may occur at least  from an explosive eruption.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The amount of damage depends on vent location, topography, and volume of magma erupted. Pyroclastic flows from vents on Mammoth Mountain or other high vent could travel farther by gaining extra momentum from their descent. Valleys along the route will be more impacted than ridges but flows and surges could overtop some ridges. Eruptions near snowpacks may produce <a href="lahar" title="wikilink">lahars</a> of mud and ash that devastate valleys and watersheds.
