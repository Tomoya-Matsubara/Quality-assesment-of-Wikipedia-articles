<p><strong>Hippocrates of Cos</strong> or <strong>Hippokrates of Kos</strong> (<em>ca</em>. 460 BC &lt;U+2013&gt; <em>ca.</em> 370 BC) - <a href="ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: ; Hippokr&lt;U+00E1&gt;t&lt;U+0113&gt;s was an <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a> <a href="physician" class="uri" title="wikilink">physician</a> of the <a href="Age_of_Pericles" title="wikilink">Age of Pericles</a> (Classical Athens), and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the <a href="history_of_medicine" title="wikilink">history of medicine</a>. He is referred to as the <a href="List_of_persons_considered_father_or_mother_of_a_scientific_field#Medicine_and_physiology" title="wikilink">father of Western medicine</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of medicine. This intellectual school revolutionized <a href="medicine_in_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">medicine in ancient Greece</a>, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been associated with (notably <a href="theurgy" class="uri" title="wikilink">theurgy</a> and <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>), thus establishing medicine as a profession.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the achievements of the writers of the <a href="Hippocratic_Corpus" title="wikilink">Corpus</a>, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine, and the actions of Hippocrates himself are often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. There are also claims that point to <a href="Imhotep" class="uri" title="wikilink">Imhotep</a> of ancient Egypt as history's first physician. Nevertheless, Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the <a href="wikt:paragon" title="wikilink">paragon</a> of the ancient physician. In particular, he is credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of <a href="clinical_medicine" title="wikilink">clinical medicine</a>, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the <a href="Hippocratic_Oath" title="wikilink">Hippocratic Oath</a>, Corpus and other works.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p><img src="Kos_Asklepeion.jpg" title="fig:Asklepieion on Kos" alt="Asklepieion on Kos" width="300" /> Historians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the <a href="Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> island of <a href="Kos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kos</a> (Cos), and became a famous physician and teacher of medicine. Other biographical information, however, is likely to be untrue (<em>see <a href="Hippocrates#Legends" title="wikilink">Legends</a></em>).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Soranus_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">Soranus of Ephesus</a>, a 2nd-century Greek <a href="gynecologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">gynecologist</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> was Hippocrates' first biographer and is the source of most information on Hippocrates' person. Information about Hippocrates can also be found in the writings of <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, which date from the 4th century BC, in the <em><a href="Suda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suda</a></em> of the 10th century AD, and in the works of <a href="John_Tzetzes" title="wikilink">John Tzetzes</a>, which date from the 12th century AD.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Soranus wrote that Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician; his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Tizane. The two sons of Hippocrates, <a href="Thessalus_(physician)" title="wikilink">Thessalus</a> and <a href="Draco_(physician)" title="wikilink">Draco</a>, and his son-in-law, <a href="Polybus_(physician)" title="wikilink">Polybus</a>, were his students. According to <a href="Galen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galen</a>, a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named <a href="Hippocrates_(physician)" title="wikilink">Hippocrates</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Soranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather, and studied other subjects with <a href="Democritus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Democritus</a> and <a href="Gorgias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gorgias</a>. Hippocrates was probably trained at the <a href="Asclepieion" title="wikilink">asklepieion</a> of <a href="Kos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kos</a>, and took lessons from the <a href="Thrace" title="wikilink">Thracian</a> physician <a href="Herodicus" title="wikilink">Herodicus of Selymbria</a>. The only contemporaneous mention of Hippocrates is in <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>'s dialogue <em><a href="Protagoras_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Protagoras</a></em>, where Plato describes Hippocrates as &quot;Hippocrates of Kos, the <a href="Asclepiad_(Greek)" title="wikilink">Asclepiad</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>, and the <a href="Sea_of_Marmara" title="wikilink">Sea of Marmara</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He probably died in <a href="Larissa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Larissa</a> at the age of 83 or 90, though some accounts say he lived to be well over 100; several different accounts of his death exist.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="hippocratic-theory">Hippocratic theory</h2>

<p>Hippocraties is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally and not as a result of superstition, and Gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of <a href="Pythagoras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a> of allying philosophy and medicine.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the <a href="Greek_gods" title="wikilink">gods</a> but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect <a href="anatomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">anatomy</a> and <a href="physiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">physiology</a>, such as <a href="Humorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Humorism</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The <a href="Knidos" title="wikilink">Knidian</a> school of medicine focused on diagnosis. Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek <a href="taboo" class="uri" title="wikilink">taboo</a> forbidding the dissection of humans. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Hippocratic school or <a href="Kos" title="wikilink">Koan</a> school achieved greater success by applying general <a href="medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnoses</a> and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and <a href="prognosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">prognosis</a>, not <a href="medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnosis</a>. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations; for example, the <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a &quot;meditation upon death&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="humorism-and-crisis">Humorism and crisis</h3>

<p>Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a <em>crisis</em>, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on <em>critical days</em>, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a <em>critical day</em>, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="HippocraticBench.png" title="fig:A drawing of a Hippocratic bench from a Byzantine edition of Galen&#39;s work in the 2nd century AD" alt="A drawing of a Hippocratic bench from a Byzantine edition of Galen&#39;s work in the 2nd century AD" width="300" /> Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach was based on &quot;the healing power of nature&quot; (&quot;<em><a href="vis_medicatrix_naturae" title="wikilink">vis medicatrix naturae</a></em>&quot; in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (<em>physis</em>).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed &quot;rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though &quot;dry&quot; treatment was preferable. Soothing <a href="balm" title="wikilink">balms</a> were sometimes employed.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required <a href="Traction_(orthopedics)" title="wikilink">traction</a> to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The <a href="Hippocratic_bench" title="wikilink">Hippocratic bench</a> and other devices were used to this end.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on <a href="prognosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">prognosis</a>. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and induce its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h3>
<p><img src="Ancientgreek_surgical.jpg" title="fig:A number of ancient Greek surgical tools. On the left is a trephine; on the right, a set of scalpels. Hippocratic medicine made good use of these tools." alt="A number of ancient Greek surgical tools. On the left is a trephine; on the right, a set of scalpels. Hippocratic medicine made good use of these tools." /> Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline, and rigorous practice.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Hippocratic work <em>On the Physician</em> recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, &quot;lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting&quot; in the ancient <a href="operating_room" title="wikilink">operating room</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He even kept his <a href="fingernail" title="wikilink">fingernails</a> to a precise length.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to know if the patient lied.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> &quot;To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the &quot;Father of <em>Clinical</em> Medicine&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

He is given credit for the first description of <a href="Nail_clubbing" title="wikilink">clubbing</a> of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic suppurative lung disease, <a href="lung_cancer" title="wikilink">lung cancer</a> and <a href="Cyanotic_heart_defect" title="wikilink">cyanotic heart disease</a>. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as &quot;Hippocratic fingers&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe <a href="Hippocratic_face" title="wikilink">Hippocratic face</a> in <em>Prognosis</em>. <a href="Shakespeare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a> famously alludes to this description when writing of <a href="Falstaff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Falstaff</a>'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of <em><a href="Henry_V_(play)" title="wikilink">Henry V</a></em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>The Hippocratic school of medicine described well the ailments of the human <a href="rectum" class="uri" title="wikilink">rectum</a> and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. <a href="Hemorrhoids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hemorrhoids</a>, for instance, though believed to be caused by an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <a href="Cautery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cautery</a> and <a href="surgery" title="wikilink">excision</a> are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: <a href="Ligature_(medicine)" title="wikilink">ligating</a> the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron.

The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of the corpus has not been conclusively answered,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> but the volumes were probably produced by his students and followers.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Because of the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, scholars believe Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person (<a href="Ermerins" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ermerins</a> numbers the authors at nineteen).<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The corpus was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity, and its teaching generally followed principles of his; thus it came to be known by his name.

Crede Ambulatory Care Center of UCSF" /> His image as the wise, old doctor is reinforced by busts of him, which wear large beards on a wrinkled face. Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of <a href="Jupiter_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Jove</a> and <a href="Asklepius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asklepius</a>. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that we have could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals. <a href="Fielding_Garrison" title="wikilink">Fielding Garrison</a>, an authority on medical history, stated, &quot;He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> &quot;His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician&lt;U+201D&gt;, according to <em>A Short History of Medicine</em>, inspiring the medical profession since his death.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="legends">Legends</h3>

<p>Most stories of Hippocrates' life are likely to be untrue because of their inconsistency with historical evidence, and because similar or identical stories are told of other figures such as <a href="Avicenna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a>, suggesting a legendary origin. Even during his life, Hippocrates' renown was great, and stories of miraculous cures arose. For example, Hippocrates was supposed to have aided in the healing of Athenians during the <a href="Plague_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Plague of Athens</a> by lighting great fires as &quot;disinfectants&quot; and engaging in other treatments. There is a story of Hippocrates curing <a href="Perdiccas_II_of_Macedon" title="wikilink">Perdiccas</a>, a <a href="Macedon" title="wikilink">Macedonian</a> king, of &quot;<a href="love_sickness" title="wikilink">love sickness</a>&quot;. Neither of these accounts is corroborated by any historians and thus it is unlikely that they ever occurred.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> <img src="Plane_tree_of_Hippocrates.jpg" title="fig:Kos town: The Plane Tree of Hippocrates, under which Hippocrates is said to have worked." alt="Kos town: The Plane Tree of Hippocrates, under which Hippocrates is said to have worked." /> Another legend concerns how Hippocrates rejected a formal request to visit the court of <a href="Artaxerxes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artaxerxes</a>, the <a href="King_of_Persia" title="wikilink">King of Persia</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The validity of this is accepted by ancient sources but denied by some modern ones, and is thus under contention.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Another tale states that <a href="Democritus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Democritus</a> was supposed to be mad because he laughed at everything, and so he was sent to Hippocrates to be cured. Hippocrates diagnosed him as merely having a happy disposition. Democritus has since been called &quot;the laughing philosopher&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all stories of Hippocrates portrayed him in a positive manner. In one legend, Hippocrates is said to have fled after setting fire to a <a href="healing_temple" title="wikilink">healing temple</a> in Greece. <a href="Soranus_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">Soranus of Ephesus</a>, the source of this story, names the temple as the one of <a href="Knidos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knidos</a>. However centuries later, the <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> Greek grammarian <a href="John_Tzetzes" title="wikilink">John Tzetzes</a>, writes that Hippocrates burned down his own temple, the <a href="Temple_of_Cos" title="wikilink">Temple of Cos</a>, speculating that he did it to maintain a <a href="monopoly" class="uri" title="wikilink">monopoly</a> of medical knowledge. This account is very much in conflict with traditional estimations of Hippocrates' personality. Other legends tell of his <a href="resurrection" class="uri" title="wikilink">resurrection</a> of <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a>'s nephew; this feat was supposedly created by the erection of a statue of Hippocrates and the establishment of a professorship in his honor in Rome. <a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="genealogy">Genealogy</h2>
