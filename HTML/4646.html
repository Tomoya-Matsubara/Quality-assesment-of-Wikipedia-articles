<p><strong>Judah Aristobulus I</strong> (from <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a> &lt;U+1F08&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03B2&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, meaning &quot;best advising&quot;;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> reigned c. 104 &lt;U+2013&gt; 103 BC<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>), was the first ruler of the <a href="Hasmonean_dynasty" title="wikilink">Hasmonean Dynasty</a> to declare himself &quot;king,&quot; and was the eldest of the five sons of <a href="John_Hyrcanus" title="wikilink">John Hyrcanus</a>, the previous leader.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Josephus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Josephus</a> would declare him the first Jew in 481 years and three months to wear the <a href="diadem" class="uri" title="wikilink">diadem</a> on his head.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Aristobulus was not only just the first king from the Hasmonean lineage, but the first of any <a href="Kings_of_Judah" title="wikilink">Hebrew kings</a> to claim both the high priesthood and the kingship title. The <a href="Sadducees" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sadducees</a> and the <a href="Essenes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essenes</a> were not concerned about the newly titles of Judah, however, the <a href="Pharisees" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pharisees</a> were infuriated of the new kingship title as they felt that the kingship can only be from decedents of the <a href="Davidic_line" title="wikilink">Davidic lineage</a> as the Hasmoneans are <a href="Levite" title="wikilink">Levites</a>. The Pharisees began a massive rebellion, but Aristrobulus died before any attempt to depose of him could occur.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Judea_Aristobulus_I.PNG" title="fig:Hasmonean Kingdom under Aristobulus " alt="Hasmonean Kingdom under Aristobulus " /> According to the directions of John Hyrcanus, the government of the country after his death was to be placed in the hands of his wife, and Aristobulus was originally to receive the high-priesthood only. Aristobulus did not approve of his father's wishes, instead, he seized the crown with the support of his brother Antigonus who would later be murdered by Aristobulus's guards. To secure his kingship, he had his mother placed in prison, where she starved to death, and to secure himself against further endangerment from his family, he placed his three brothers into prison except for Antigonus.&lt;ref name=Magness (2012)&gt;</ref></p>
<h3 id="conquest-of-galilee">Conquest of Galilee</h3>
<p>Much of the <a href="Galilee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galilee</a> region was annexed by Aristobulus, however, there was some resistance from the <a href="Iturea" title="wikilink">Arab Ituraean</a> tribes by the northern parts of the region that required military operations. The region made it difficult to conduct such campaigning against the Galilee inhabitants. In the end, Aristobulus would eventually conquer much of the territory from them.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>The <a href="Golan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Golan</a> was also taken during the campaign and <a href="Mount_Hermon" title="wikilink">Mount Hermon</a> as well.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>&lt;ref name=Magness (2012)/&gt; The conquered inhabitants were forced into to <a href="circumcision" class="uri" title="wikilink">circumcision</a> and were also forced to accept the <a href="Judaism" title="wikilink">Jewish faith</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>&lt;ref name=Magness (2012)/&gt;</p>
<h3 id="death-and-successor">Death and successor</h3>
<p>Aristobulus's feeble health gradually lead his remaining reign under the control of a clique, at the head of which stood Alexandra Salome, the queen. Through his machinations reign, he was led to suspect his favorite brother, Antigonus&lt;U+2014&gt;whom he had entrusted with a share in the government, and whom he treated almost as a coregent&lt;U+2014&gt;of designs against him. When he showed signs of disease, his wife, the queen, conspired to murder Antigonus. She deceived the king with suggestions that his brother Antigonus was attempting to overthrow him by force. Salome then convinced Antigonus that his king wished to see his new armor, while telling Aristobulus that his brother was coming to kill him. Antigonus was killed by Aristobulus's soldiers before he could get close to Aristobulus. Days later, Aristobulus died from pain and internal bleeding from a disease, which Jews perceived his death as a sign of God's disgruntlement. The queen released the younger brothers from prison, placing Alexander Jannaeus on the throne.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="archeological-findings">Archeological findings</h2>
<h3 id="galilee-and-golan-settlements">Galilee and Golan settlements</h3>
<p>Archaeological findings in eastern Galilee and lower Golan reveal massive ethnic changes in the area just before, during, and immediately after Aristobulus's reign. Beginning with John Hyrcanus and ending with Alexander Jannaeus, large numbers of pro-Hasmonean Jews immigrated into those territories to support Hasmonean political, economic, and religious ideology, displacing much of the indigenous population. Although many of these towns were later seized by <a href="Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> forces who instituted pro-Hellenic policies, the previous Hasmonean influence survived and would incite conflict during and after the rule of <a href="Herod_the_Great" title="wikilink">Herod the Great</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="coinage">Coinage</h3>
<p>The first mint of <a href="Hasmonean_coinage" title="wikilink">Hasmonean coins</a> didn't begin until the leadership of John Hyrcanus I. Like his father, Judah Aristobulus only minted his coins with the title of the high priesthood. It wasn't until Alexander Jannaeus that both the roles of kingship and the high priesthood were minted onto coins.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>The majority of Judah's coins were found in the regions of Galilee and the Golan, primary, the largest amount of coins were from <a href="Gamla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gamla</a>. Majority of them come from his actual reign, while a small amount of these coins were minted after.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
