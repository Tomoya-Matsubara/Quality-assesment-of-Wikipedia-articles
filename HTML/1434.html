<p><strong>Roald Dahl</strong> (;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ; 13 September 191623 November 1990) was a <a href="British_people" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="novelist" class="uri" title="wikilink">novelist</a>, <a href="short_story_writer" title="wikilink">short story writer</a>, <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a>, <a href="fighter_pilot" title="wikilink">fighter pilot</a>, and <a href="screenwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">screenwriter</a>.</p>
<p>Born in Wales to Norwegian parents, Dahl served in the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, in which he became a <a href="flying_ace" title="wikilink">flying ace</a> and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of Acting <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">wing commander</a>. He rose to prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults and became one of the world's best-selling authors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He has been referred to as &quot;one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Among his awards for contribution to literature, he received the <a href="World_Fantasy_Award_for_Life_Achievement" title="wikilink">World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement</a> in 1983, and Children's Author of the Year from the <a href="Specsavers_National_Book_Awards" title="wikilink">British Book Awards</a> in 1990. In 2008 <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> placed Dahl 16th on its list of &quot;The 50 greatest <a href="British_literature" title="wikilink">British writers</a> since 1945&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings and his children's books for their unsentimental, often very <a href="black_comedy" title="wikilink">dark humour</a>. His works include <em><a href="James_and_the_Giant_Peach" title="wikilink">James and the Giant Peach</a></em>, <em><a href="Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory" title="wikilink">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, <em><a href="Matilda_(novel)" title="wikilink">Matilda</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Witches_(book)" title="wikilink">The Witches</a></em>, <em><a href="Fantastic_Mr_Fox" title="wikilink">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Twits" title="wikilink">The Twits</a></em>, <em><a href="George&#39;s_Marvellous_Medicine" title="wikilink">George's Marvellous Medicine</a></em> and <em><a href="The_BFG" title="wikilink">The BFG</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Roald Dahl was born at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road in <a href="Llandaff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Llandaff</a>, <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>, Wales, in 1916, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (<em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Hesselberg).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from <a href="Sarpsborg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarpsborg</a>, Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the <a href="polar_explorer" title="wikilink">polar explorer</a> <a href="Roald_Amundsen" title="wikilink">Roald Amundsen</a>, a national hero in Norway at the time. He spoke Norwegian at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were baptised at the <a href="Norwegian_Church,_Cardiff" title="wikilink">Norwegian Church, Cardiff</a>, where their parents worshipped.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a>. Weeks later, his father died of <a href="pneumonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a> at the age of 57 while on a fishing trip in the Antarctic. With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales because Harald had wished to have their children educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Dahl first attended <a href="The_Cathedral_School,_Llandaff" title="wikilink">The Cathedral School, Llandaff</a>. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were <a href="Corporal_punishment" title="wikilink">caned</a> by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> which was owned by a &quot;mean and loathsome&quot; old woman called Mrs Pratchett.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This was known among the five boys as the &quot;<a href="Boy_(book)#Great_mouse_plot_of_1924" title="wikilink">Great Mouse Plot of 1924</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Thereafter, he transferred to a <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a> in England: St Peter's in <a href="Weston-super-Mare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weston-super-Mare</a>. Roald's parents had wanted him to be educated at an English <a href="Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">public school</a> and, because of a then regular ferry link across the <a href="Bristol_Channel" title="wikilink">Bristol Channel</a>, this proved to be the nearest. His time at St Peter's was an unpleasant experience for him. He was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed to her his unhappiness, being under the pressure of school censorship. Only after her death in 1967 did he find out that she had saved every single one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography <em><a href="Boy_(book)" title="wikilink">Boy: Tales of Childhood</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1929, he attended <a href="Repton_School" title="wikilink">Repton School</a> in <a href="Derbyshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a>, where, according to <em>Boy: Tales of Childhood</em>, a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster <a href="Geoffrey_Fisher" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Fisher</a>, who later became the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and went on <a href="Coronation_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">to crown</a> <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1953. (However, according to Dahl's biographer <a href="Jeremy_Treglown" title="wikilink">Jeremy Treglown</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton and the headmaster concerned was in fact <a href="John_Traill_Christie" title="wikilink">J. T. Christie</a>, Fisher's successor.) This caused Dahl to &quot;have doubts about religion and even about God&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report &quot;I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Dahl was exceptionally tall, reaching  in adult life.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He excelled at sports, being made captain of the school <a href="fives" class="uri" title="wikilink">fives</a> and <a href="Squash_(sport)" title="wikilink">squash</a> teams, and also playing for the <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> team.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> As well as having a passion for literature, he also developed an interest in photography<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and often carried a camera with him. During his years at Repton, <a href="Cadbury_plc" title="wikilink">Cadbury</a>, the chocolate company, would occasionally send boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils. Dahl apparently used to dream of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of Mr Cadbury himself; and this proved the inspiration for him to write his third book for children, <em><a href="Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory" title="wikilink">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> (1964), and to include references to chocolate in other books for children.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent the majority of his summer holidays with his mother's family in Norway, and wrote about many happy memories from those expeditions in <em>Boy: Tales of Childhood</em>, such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half&lt;U+2013&gt;sister's fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s pipe with goat droppings.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He only experienced one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway at around the age of eight, when his <a href="adenoid" title="wikilink">adenoids</a> were removed by a doctor.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> His childhood and first job selling kerosene in <a href="Midsomer_Norton" title="wikilink">Midsomer Norton</a> and surrounding villages in <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, <a href="South_West_England" title="wikilink">South West England</a> are subjects in <em>Boy: Tales of Childhood</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The main child character in his 1983 book <em><a href="The_Witches_(book)" title="wikilink">The Witches</a></em> is a British boy of Norwegian descent, whose grandmother is still living in Norway.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the  and hiked through <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> with the <a href="BSES_Expeditions" title="wikilink">Public Schools Exploring Society</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In July 1934, Dahl joined the <a href="Royal_Dutch_Shell" title="wikilink">Shell Petroleum</a> Company. Following two years of training in the United Kingdom, he was transferred to first <a href="Mombasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mombasa</a>, Kenya, then to <a href="Dar-es-Salaam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dar-es-Salaam</a>, <a href="Tanganyika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanganyika</a> (now Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar-es-Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered <a href="black_mamba" title="wikilink">black mambas</a> and lions, among other wildlife.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fighter-ace">Fighter ace</h2>
<p>In August 1939, as World War II loomed, plans were made to round up the hundreds of Germans in <a href="Dar-es-Salaam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dar-es-Salaam</a>. Dahl was made a <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="King&#39;s_African_Rifles" title="wikilink">King's African Rifles</a>, commanding a platoon of <a href="Askari" title="wikilink">Askaris</a>, indigenous troops serving in the colonial army.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1939, Dahl joined the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> as an <a href="aircraftman" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraftman</a>. After a  car journey from Dar-es-Salaam to <a href="Nairobi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nairobi</a>, he was accepted for flight training with 16 other men, of whom only three others survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a <a href="De_Havilland_Tiger_Moth" title="wikilink">De Havilland Tiger Moth</a>, he flew solo;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Dahl enjoyed watching the wildlife of <a href="Kenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenya</a> during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in Iraq, at <a href="RAF_Habbaniya" title="wikilink">RAF Habbaniya</a>,  west of <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>. He was promoted to <a href="leading_aircraftman" title="wikilink">leading aircraftman</a> on 24 August 1940.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Following six months' training on <a href="Hawker_Hart" title="wikilink">Hawker Harts</a>, Dahl was made an <a href="acting_pilot_officer" title="wikilink">acting pilot officer</a>.</p>
<p>He was assigned to <a href="No._80_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 80 Squadron RAF</a>, flying obsolete <a href="Gloster_Gladiator" title="wikilink">Gloster Gladiators</a>, the last <a href="biplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">biplane</a> <a href="fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighter aircraft</a> used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in <a href="aerial_combat" title="wikilink">aerial combat</a>, or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl was ordered to fly his Gladiator from Abu Sueir in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, on to Amiriya to refuel, and again to Fouka in <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a> for a second refuelling. From there he would fly to 80 Squadron's forward <a href="airstrip" class="uri" title="wikilink">airstrip</a>  south of <a href="Mersa_Matruh" title="wikilink">Mersa Matruh</a>. On the final leg, he could not find the airstrip and, running low on <a href="fuel" class="uri" title="wikilink">fuel</a> and with night approaching, he was forced to attempt a <a href="Accidents_and_incidents_in_aviation#Causes" title="wikilink">landing</a> in the desert.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed, fracturing his skull, smashing his nose and temporarily blinding him.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He managed to drag himself away from the blazing wreckage and passed out. Later, he wrote about the crash in his first published work.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Dahl was rescued and taken to a <a href="first_aid" title="wikilink">first-aid</a> post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight, and was then taken by train to the Royal Navy hospital in <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. An RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead to the <a href="no_man&#39;s_land" title="wikilink">no man's land</a> between the Allied and Italian forces.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1941, Dahl was discharged from hospital and passed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the <a href="Battle_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek campaign</a> and based at <a href="Eleusina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eleusina</a>, near <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. The squadron was now equipped with <a href="Hawker_Hurricane" title="wikilink">Hawker Hurricanes</a>. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four <a href="Bristol_Blenheim" title="wikilink">Bristol Blenheim</a> light bombers. Dahl saw his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of <a href="Chalcis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcis</a>. He attacked six <a href="Junkers_Ju-88" title="wikilink">Junkers Ju-88s</a> that were bombing ships and shot one down. On 16 April in another air battle, he shot down another Ju-88.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>On 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in the &quot;<a href="Battle_of_Athens_(1941)" title="wikilink">Battle of Athens</a>&quot;, alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, <a href="Marmaduke_Pattle" title="wikilink">Pat Pattle</a> and Dahl's friend <a href="David_Coke" title="wikilink">David Coke</a>. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as <em>&quot;an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side&quot;.</em><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in <a href="Haifa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haifa</a>. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a <a href="Vichy_French_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Vichy French Air Force</a> <a href="Potez_63" title="wikilink">Potez 63</a> on 8 June and another Ju-88 on 15 June, but he then began to get severe headaches that caused him to <a href="G-LOC" title="wikilink">black out</a>. He was invalided home to Britain. Though at this time Dahl was only a Pilot Officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a <a href="Pilot_Officer" title="wikilink">Pilot Officer</a> and promoted to war substantive <a href="Flying_Officer" title="wikilink">Flying Officer</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diplomat-writer-and-intelligence-officer">Diplomat, writer and intelligence officer</h2>
<p>After being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in Uxbridge while attempting to recover his health enough to become an instructor.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In late March 1942, while in London, he met the <a href="Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Air" title="wikilink">Under-Secretary of State for Air</a>, Major Harold Balfour (later <a href="Harold_Balfour,_1st_Baron_Balfour_of_Inchrye" title="wikilink">Lord Balfour</a>), at his club. Impressed by his war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed Dahl as assistant air attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; at the <a href="British_Embassy" title="wikilink">British Embassy</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>. Initially resistant, he was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the SS <em>Batori</em> from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to Montreal. Coming from war-starved Britain, Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the U.S. capital, but was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. Nor was he impressed by the ambassador, <a href="Lord_Halifax" title="wikilink">Lord Halifax</a>, whom he sometimes played tennis with and described as &quot;a courtly English gentleman.&quot; As part of his duties as assistant air attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Dahl was to help neutralise the isolationist views many Americans still held by giving pro-British speeches and discussing his war service; the US had only entered the war the previous December, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After only ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on &quot;a most ungodly unimportant job.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> As he later said:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>I'd just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America.</em>&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>However, at this time Dahl met the noted novelist <a href="C._S._Forester" title="wikilink">C. S. Forester</a>, who was also working to aid the British war effort. <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em> had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl's flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it. The original title of the article was &quot;A Piece of Cake&quot; but the title was changed to &quot;Shot Down Over Libya&quot; to make it sound more dramatic, despite the fact that Dahl had not actually been shot down; it appeared in the 1 August issue of the <em>Post</em>. He shared a house at 1610 34th Street, NW, in <a href="Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>, with another attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;. Dahl socialized with Texas publisher and oilman Charles E. Marsh at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia. <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Dahl was promoted to <a href="flight_lieutenant" title="wikilink">flight lieutenant</a> (war-substantive) in August.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> During the war, Forester worked for the British Information Service and was writing propaganda for the Allied cause, mainly for American consumption.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This work introduced Dahl to espionage and the activities of the Canadian spymaster <a href="William_Stephenson" title="wikilink">William Stephenson</a>, known by the codename &quot;Intrepid&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Stephenson and his organisation known as <a href="British_Security_Coordination" title="wikilink">British Security Coordination</a>,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> which was part of <a href="Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="wikilink">MI6</a>. He was revealed in the 1980s to have been serving to help promote Britain's interests and message in the United States and to combat the &quot;<a href="America_First_Committee" title="wikilink">America First</a>&quot; movement, working with such other well-known officers as <a href="Ian_Fleming" title="wikilink">Ian Fleming</a> and <a href="David_Ogilvy_(businessman)" title="wikilink">David Ogilvy</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;I got booted out by the big boys,&quot; he said. Stephenson promptly sent him back to Washington&lt;U+2014&gt;with a promotion to <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Wing Commander</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Towards the end of the war, Dahl wrote some of the history of the secret organisation and he and Stephenson remained friends for decades after the war.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon the war's conclusion, Dahl held the rank of a temporary <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">wing commander</a> (substantive flight lieutenant). Owing to the seriousness of his accident in 1940, he was pronounced unfit for further service and was invalided out of the RAF in August 1946. He left the service with the substantive rank of <a href="squadron_leader" title="wikilink">squadron leader</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> His record of five aerial victories, qualifying him as a <a href="flying_ace" title="wikilink">flying ace</a>, has been confirmed by post-war research and cross-referenced in Axis records, although it is most likely that he scored more than that during 20 April 1941 when 22 German aircraft were shot down.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Their marriage lasted for 30 years and they had five children: Olivia Twenty (20 April 1955 &lt;U+2013&gt; 17 November 1962); Chantal <a href="Tessa_Dahl" title="wikilink">Tessa Sophia</a> (b. 1957); Theo Matthew (b. 1960); <a href="Ophelia_Dahl" title="wikilink">Ophelia Magdalena</a> (b. 1964); and <a href="Lucy_Dahl" title="wikilink">Lucy Neal</a> (b. 1965).<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>On 5 December 1960, four-month-old Theo Dahl was severely injured when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. For a time, he suffered from <a href="hydrocephalus" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrocephalus</a> and, as a result, his father became involved in the development of what became known as the &quot;<a href="Wade-Dahl-Till_valve" title="wikilink">Wade-Dahl-Till</a>&quot; (or WDT) valve, a device to alleviate the condition.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1962, Olivia Dahl died of <a href="Subacute_sclerosing_panencephalitis" title="wikilink">measles encephalitis</a> at age seven.

<p>Some of his short stories are supposed to be extracts from the diary of his (fictional) Uncle Oswald, a rich gentleman whose sexual exploits form the subject of these stories.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In his novel <em><a href="My_Uncle_Oswald" title="wikilink">My Uncle Oswald</a></em>, the uncle engages a temptress to seduce 20th century geniuses and royalty with a love potion secretly added to chocolate truffles made by Dahl's favourite chocolate shop, <a href="Prestat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prestat</a> of Piccadilly, London.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="childrens-fiction">Children's fiction</h3>
<p>Dahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult <a href="villain" title="wikilink">villains</a> who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one &quot;good&quot; adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding schools</a> he attended.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> They usually contain a lot of <a href="black_comedy" title="wikilink">black humour</a> and grotesque scenarios, including gruesome violence. <em><a href="The_Witches_(book)" title="wikilink">The Witches</a></em>, <em><a href="George&#39;s_Marvellous_Medicine" title="wikilink">George's Marvellous Medicine</a></em> and <em><a href="Matilda_(novel)" title="wikilink">Matilda</a></em> are examples of this formula. <em><a href="The_BFG" title="wikilink">The BFG</a></em> follows it in a more analogous way with the good giant (the BFG or &quot;Big Friendly Giant&quot;) representing the &quot;good adult&quot; archetype and the other giants being the &quot;bad adults&quot;. This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for <em><a href="Chitty_Chitty_Bang_Bang_(film)" title="wikilink">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a></em>. Class-conscious themes &lt;U+2013&gt; ranging from the thinly veiled to the blatant &lt;U+2013&gt; also surface in works such as <em><a href="Fantastic_Mr_Fox" title="wikilink">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em> and <em><a href="Danny,_the_Champion_of_the_World" title="wikilink">Danny, the Champion of the World</a></em>.</p>
<p>Dahl also features in his books characters who are very fat, usually children. <a href="Augustus_Gloop" title="wikilink">Augustus Gloop</a>, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in <em><a href="James_and_the_Giant_Peach" title="wikilink">James and the Giant Peach</a></em> and the nasty farmer Boggis in <em><a href="Fantastic_Mr_Fox" title="wikilink">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em> is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from <a href="Willy_Wonka" title="wikilink">Willy Wonka</a>'s chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In <em><a href="Matilda_(novel)" title="wikilink">Matilda</a></em>, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featuring in <em><a href="The_Witches_(book)" title="wikilink">The Witches</a></em>, Bruno Jenkins is turned into a mouse by witches who lure him to their convention with the promise of chocolate, and, it is speculated, possibly disowned or even killed by his parents because of this. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in <em><a href="The_BFG" title="wikilink">The BFG</a></em>, the fox family in <em><a href="Fantastic_Mr_Fox" title="wikilink">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em> and the trolls in <em><a href="The_Minpins" title="wikilink">The Minpins</a></em>.</p>
<p>In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and <a href="fairy_tales" title="wikilink">fairy tales</a>, providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl's collection of poems <em><a href="Revolting_Rhymes" title="wikilink">Revolting Rhymes</a></em> is recorded in <a href="audio_book" title="wikilink">audio book</a> form, and narrated by actor <a href="Alan_Cumming" title="wikilink">Alan Cumming</a>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="screenplays">Screenplays</h3>
<p>For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the <a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">James Bond</a> film <em><a href="You_Only_Live_Twice_(film)" title="wikilink">You Only Live Twice</a></em> and <em><a href="Chitty_Chitty_Bang_Bang" title="wikilink">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a></em>, were adaptations of novels by <a href="Ian_Fleming" title="wikilink">Ian Fleming</a>, though both were rewritten and completed by other writers. Dahl created the <a href="Child_Catcher" title="wikilink">Child Catcher</a>, the supporting antagonist in <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em>; in a 2005 poll, it was voted the scariest villain in children's literature.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Dahl also began adapting his own novel <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, which was completed and rewritten by <a href="David_Seltzer" title="wikilink">David Seltzer</a> after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film <em><a href="Willy_Wonka_&amp;_the_Chocolate_Factory" title="wikilink">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em> (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was &quot;disappointed&quot; because &quot;he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> He was also &quot;infuriated&quot; by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaption for the sequel <em><a href="Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator" title="wikilink">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</a></em>.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="influences">Influences</h3>
<p>A major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. Amongst his favourite authors were <a href="Rudyard_Kipling" title="wikilink">Rudyard Kipling</a>, <a href="William_Makepeace_Thackeray" title="wikilink">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>, <a href="Frederick_Marryat" title="wikilink">Frederick Marryat</a> and <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>, and their works went on to make a lasting mark on his life and writing. Dahl was also a huge fan of ghost stories and claimed that <em>Trolls</em> by <a href="Jonas_Lie" title="wikilink">Jonas Lie</a> was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, would relate traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: &quot;She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten.&quot;<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he created a grandmother character in <em><a href="The_Witches_(book)" title="wikilink">The Witches</a></em> and later stated that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="television">Television</h3>
<p>In 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a science fiction and <a href="Horror_and_terror" title="wikilink">horror</a> television <a href="anthology_series" title="wikilink">anthology series</a> called <em><a href="Way_Out_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Way Out</a></em>, which preceded the <em><a href="The_Twilight_Zone_(1959_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Twilight Zone</a></em> series on the <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> network for 14 episodes from March to July.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at <a href="The_Paley_Center_for_Media" title="wikilink">The Paley Center for Media</a> in New York City and Los Angeles.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> He also wrote for the satirical BBC comedy programme <em><a href="That_Was_the_Week_That_Was" title="wikilink">That Was the Week That Was</a></em> which was hosted by <a href="David_Frost" title="wikilink">David Frost</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>The British television series, <em><a href="Tales_of_the_Unexpected_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Tales of the Unexpected</a></em>, originally aired on <a href="ITV_(TV_network)" title="wikilink">ITV</a> between 1979 and 1988.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The series was released to tie in with Dahl's <em><a href="Tales_of_the_Unexpected_(book)" title="wikilink">Tales of the Unexpected</a></em>, which had introduced readers to many motifs that were common in his writing.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The series was an anthology of different tales, initially based on Dahl's short stories.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic and usually had a twist ending. Dahl introduced on camera all the episodes of the first two series, which bore the full title <em>Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected</em>.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
