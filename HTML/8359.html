<p><strong>Nguy&lt;U+1EC5&gt;n V&lt;U+0103&gt;n Thi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;u</strong> (; April 5, 1923 – September 29, 2001) was a general in the <a href="Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) who went on to become the President of <a href="South_Vietnam" title="wikilink">South Vietnam</a> (1965–75), first as the head of a military junta and then after winning a fraudulent election. He established an authoritarian and corrupt rule over South Vietnam until resigning and fleeing the nation a few days before the <a href="fall_of_Saigon" title="wikilink">fall of Saigon</a> and the ultimate communist victory.</p>
<p>Born in the southern coast town of <a href="Phan_Rang" title="wikilink">Phan Rang</a>, Thieu initially joined the communist-dominated <a href="Vietminh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietminh</a> of <a href="Ho_Chi_Minh" title="wikilink">Ho Chi Minh</a> but quit after a year and joined the <a href="Vietnamese_National_Army" title="wikilink">Vietnamese National Army</a> (VNA) of the French-backed <a href="State_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">State of Vietnam</a>. He gradually rose up the ranks and in 1954 led a battalion in expelling the communists from his native village. Following the withdrawal of the French, the VNA became the ARVN and Thieu was the head of the <a href="Vietnamese_National_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">Vietnamese National Military Academy</a> for four years before becoming a division commander and colonel. In November 1960, he helped <a href="1960_South_Vietnamese_coup_attempt" title="wikilink">put down a coup attempt</a> against President <a href="Ngo_Dinh_Diem" title="wikilink">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>. During this time he also converted to <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> and joined the regime&lt;U+2019&gt;s secret <a href="Can_Lao_Party" title="wikilink">Can Lao Party</a>; Diem gave preferential treatment to his co-religionists and Thieu was accused of being one of many who converted for political advancement.</p>
<p>Despite this, Thieu agreed to join the <a href="1963_South_Vietnamese_coup" title="wikilink">coup against Diem in November 1963</a> in the midst of the <a href="Buddhist_crisis" title="wikilink">Buddhist crisis</a>, leading the siege on <a href="Gia_Long_Palace" title="wikilink">Gia Long Palace</a>. Diem was <a href="arrest_and_assassination_of_Ngo_Dinh_Diem" title="wikilink">captured and executed</a> and Thieu made a general. Following Diem&lt;U+2019&gt;s demise, there was a series of short-lived juntas as coups occurred frequently. Thieu gradually moved up the ranks of the junta by adopting a cautious approach while other officers around him defeated and sidelined one another. In 1965, stability came to South Vietnam when he became the figurehead head of state, while Air Marshal <a href="Nguyen_Cao_Ky" title="wikilink">Nguyen Cao Ky</a> became prime minister, leading a junta that ended the cycle of coups with two years of continuity, although both men were rivals.</p>
<p>In 1967, a transition to elected government was scheduled and after a power struggle within the military, Thieu ran for the presidency with Ky as his running mate—both men had wanted the top job. To allow the two to work together, their fellow officers had agreed to have a military body controlled by Ky shape policy behind the scenes. The election was rigged to ensure that Thieu and Ky&lt;U+2019&gt;s military ticket would win. Leadership tensions became evident and Thieu prevailed, sidelining Ky supporters from key military and cabinet posts. Thieu then passed legislation to restrict candidacy eligibility for the 1971 election, banning almost all would-be opponents, while the rest withdrew as it was obvious that the poll would be a sham; Thieu went on to win more than 90% of the vote and the election uncontested, while Ky retired from politics.</p>
<p>During his rule, Thieu gained a reputation for turning a blind eye to and indulging in corruption, and pointing loyal cronies rather than competent officers to lead ARVN units. In 1968 he was caught out by the <a href="Tet_Offensive" title="wikilink">Tet Offensive</a> due to complacency, and during the 1971 <a href="Operation_Lam_Son_719" title="wikilink">Operation Lam Son 719</a> and the communists&lt;U+2019&gt; <a href="Easter_Offensive" title="wikilink">Easter Offensive</a>, the <a href="I_Corps_(South_Vietnam)" title="wikilink">I Corps</a> in the north of the country was under the command of his confidant <a href="Hoang_Xuan_Lam" title="wikilink">Hoang Xuan Lam</a>, whose incompetence led to heavy defeats until Thieu finally replaced him with <a href="Ngo_Quang_Truong" title="wikilink">Ngo Quang Truong</a>. After the signing of the <a href="Paris_Peace_Accords" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Accords</a>—which Thieu opposed—and the American withdrawal, South Vietnam struggled to hold off the communists&lt;U+2019&gt; <a href="Ho_Chi_Minh_Campaign" title="wikilink">final push for victory</a>. Thieu gave contradictory orders to Truong to stand and fight or withdraw and consolidate, leading to mass panic and collapse in the north of the country. This allowed the communists to generate much momentum and they were close to <a href="Saigon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saigon</a> within a month, prompting Thieu to resign and leave the country aboard an American helicopter with millions of dollars in gold, just before the communists completed their victory. He eventually settled in <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> and lived in seclusion until his death, avoiding angry refugee compatriots who blamed his administration for the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s demise.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="Phan_Rang" title="wikilink">Phan Rang</a> in <a href="Ninh_Thuan_Province" title="wikilink">Ninh Thuan Province</a> on the south central coast of Vietnam, Thieu was a son of a small but well-to-do landowner who earned his living by farming and fishing. Thieu was the youngest of five children.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to some reports, Thieu was born in November 1924, but adopted April 5, 1923 as his birthday on grounds that it was a more auspicious day.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thieu's older brothers raised money so that he could attend the elite schools run by France, who were Vietnam's colonial masters.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thieu attended the French-run Catholic <a href="Pellerin_School" title="wikilink">Pellerin School</a> in Hue, the imperial seat of the <a href="Nguyen_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Nguyen Dynasty</a> and returned to his hometown after graduating.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>During World War II, <a href="Imperial_Japan" title="wikilink">Imperial Japan</a> invaded <a href="French_Indochina" title="wikilink">French Indochina</a> and seized control. Ninh Thuan was taken over by the Japanese in 1942, but the reaction from the locals was muted, and Thieu continued to work the ricelands alongside his father for another three years.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>When World War II ended, Thieu joined the <a href="Viet_Minh" title="wikilink">Viet Minh</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> led by <a href="Ho_Chi_Minh" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+1ED3&gt; Ch&lt;U+00ED&gt; Minh</a>, whose goal was to liberate Vietnam from French colonialism.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> With no rifles, Thieu's class of Vietminh recruits trained in jungle clearings with bamboo.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He rose to be district chief,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> but left the movement after just one year, following the return of the French to southern Vietnam in 1946 to contest Vietminh control.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Thieu said &quot;By August of 1946, I knew that Viet Minh were Communists&lt;U+2026&gt;They shot people.

<p>With the help of his brother, Nguyen Van Hieu, a Paris-trained lawyer who served in the upper echelons of the State of Vietnam government, Thi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;u initially was enrolled in the Merchant Marine Academy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> After a year, he was given his officer's commission, but he rejected a position on a ship when he discovered that the French owners were going to pay him less than his French colleagues.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This incident was said to have made him suspicious of foreigners.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thieu later became known for his paranoia and distrust of his American allies when he rose to the top of politics.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu transferred to the National Military Academy in <a href="Da_Lat" title="wikilink">Da Lat</a>. In 1949, upon graduation, he was commissioned a 2<sup>nd</sup> <a href="Lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lieutenant</a> from the first officer candidates' course of the <a href="Vietnam_National_Army" title="wikilink">Vietnam National Army</a>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> which had been created by former Emperor <a href="B&lt;U+1EA3&gt;o_&lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+1EA3&gt;o &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+1EA1&gt;i</a> who had agreed to be the Chief of State of the <a href="State_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">State of Vietnam</a> to fight against the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> of the Viet Minh.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Thieu started as the commander of an infantry platoon fighting against the Viet Minh.

<p>Thi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;u was a <a href="lieutenant_colonel" title="wikilink">lieutenant colonel</a> when the Republic of Vietnam (<a href="South_Vietnam" title="wikilink">South Vietnam</a>) was founded and officially gained full sovereignty after the withdrawal of French forces in 1955, following the <a href="Geneva_Conference_(1954)" title="wikilink">1954 Geneva Agreement</a>.

<p>On November 11, 1960, Colonels <a href="Vuong_Van_Dong" title="wikilink">Vuong Van Dong</a> and <a href="Nguyen_Chanh_Thi" title="wikilink">Nguyen Chanh Thi</a> launched a coup attempt against President <a href="Ngo_Dinh_Diem" title="wikilink">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>, but after surrounding the palace, they stopped attacking and decided to negotiate a power-sharing agreement. Diem then falsely promised reform, allowing him time for loyalists to come to the rescue. The rebels had also failed to seal the highways into the capital to block loyalist reinforcements.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu sent infantry from his <a href="7th_Divison_(South_Vietnam)" title="wikilink">7th Division</a> from <a href="Bien_Hoa" title="wikilink">Bien Hoa</a>, a town just north of Saigon, to help rescue Diem.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> As the false promises of reform were being aired, <a href="Tran_Thien_Khiem" title="wikilink">Tran Thien Khiem</a>'s men approached the palace grounds.

<p>Thieu turned against Diem late, and led his 5th Division in the revolt. The mainly Buddhist generals thought it appropriate that he attack the Catholic Diem. Late on the night of November 1, as light drizzle fell, Thieu's tanks, artillery, and troops advanced towards the grounds of <a href="Gia_Long_Palace" title="wikilink">Gia Long Palace</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A little before 22:00, infantry started the assault, covered by tank and artillery fire, which flattened the Presidential Guard barracks. Demolition units set charges to the palace, and rebel flamethrowers sprayed buildings, as the two sides exchanged gunfire.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> After a lull, shortly after 3:00, the shelling resumed, and just after 4:00, Thieu ordered the start of the final stage of the siege. By 6:37, the palace fell.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was then made a general by the junta after they took power.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Diem had been promised exile by the generals, but after running away from the palace, was executed on the journey back to military headquarters after being captured.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <a href="Duong_Van_Minh" title="wikilink">Duong Van Minh</a>, the junta and coup leader, was generally blamed for ordering Diem's killing, but there has been debate about the culpability.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>When Thieu rose to become president, Minh blamed him for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thieu had caused the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack on Gia Long Palace, implying that if Diem was captured there, junior officers could not have killed him while in a small group. General <a href="Tran_Van_Don" title="wikilink">Tran Van Don</a>, another plotter, was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night of the siege, asking him on the phone &quot;Why are you so slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask <a href="Ton_That_Dinh" title="wikilink">Dinh</a> to send more troops—and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Thieu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement that Minh did not dispute:&quot;Duong Van Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ngo Dinh Diem.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Diem remained a taboo subject until Thieu became president. Thieu's regime first approved of public memorial services for Diem upon the eighth anniversary of his death in 1971, and this was the third year that such services were permitted. Madame Thieu, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass for Diem at the Saigon basilica.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="junta-member">Junta member</h2>
<p>Thieu was rewarded with membership in the 12-man Military Revolutionary Council led by General Minh, and served as the secretary general;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> the leading figures in the MRC were Generals Minh, <a href="Tran_Van_Don" title="wikilink">Tran Van Don</a>, <a href="Le_Van_Kim" title="wikilink">Le Van Kim</a> and <a href="Ton_That_Dinh" title="wikilink">Ton That Dinh</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 1964, the junta head General <a href="Nguyen_Khanh" title="wikilink">Nguyen Khanh</a> decided to increase his authority by declaring a state of emergency, increasing police powers, banning protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He drafted a new constitution,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> which would have augmented his personal power. However, these moves only served to weaken Khanh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Fearing that he could be toppled by the intensifying protests, Khanh made concessions,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> repealing the new constitution and police measures, and promising to reinstate civilian rule and remove <a href="Can_Lao_Party" title="wikilink">Can Lao Party</a>—a secret Catholic organization used to infiltrate and spy on society to maintain Diem's regime—members from power.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Many senior officers decried what they viewed as a handing of power to the Buddhist leaders,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> particular the Catholics such as Khiem and Thieu. They then tried to remove Khanh in favour of Minh, and recruited many officers into their plot. Khiem and Thieu sought out US Ambassador <a href="Maxwell_Taylor" title="wikilink">Maxwell Taylor</a> and sought a private endorsement for a coup, but Taylor did not want any more changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiem's group from enacting their plans.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>The division among the generals came to a head at a meeting of the MRC on August 26–27. Khanh claimed that the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned <a href="Dai_Viet_Quoc_Dan_Dang" title="wikilink">Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang</a> (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Prominent officers associated with the Dai Viet included Thieu and Khiem.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Khiem blamed Khanh's concessions to Buddhist activists as the reason for the trouble.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Thieu and another Catholic General <a href="Nguyen_Huu_Co" title="wikilink">Nguyen Huu Co</a> called for the replacement of Khanh with Minh, but the latter refused.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Feeling pressured by the strong condemnations of his colleagues, Khanh said that he would resign. However, after further deadlock, Khanh, Minh, and Khiem were put together in a triumvirate to resolved the problem, but tensions remained as Khanh dominated the decisionmaking.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 15, 1964, Thieu became the commander of <a href="IV_Corps_(South_Vietnam)" title="wikilink">IV Corps</a>, which oversaw the <a href="Mekong_Delta" title="wikilink">Mekong Delta</a> region of the country, and three divisions.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> This came after the Buddhists had lobbied Khanh to remove General <a href="Duong_Van_Duc" title="wikilink">Duong Van Duc</a> from command of IV Corps;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Duc responded with a failed coup attempt along with <a href="Lam_Van_Phat" title="wikilink">Lam Van Phat</a> on September 13.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> During the coup attempt, Khiem and Thieu's lack of public action, combined with their criticism of Khanh was seen as tacit support of the rebels.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> A US Embassy logs during the coup claimed that the Thieu and Khiem &quot;seem so passive that they appear to have been either tacitly supporting or associated with his move by Duc and Phat&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> However, after the coup faltered, the pair &quot;issued expressions of firm support for Khanh somewhat belatedly&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Thieu was part of a group of younger officers called the Young Turks—the most prominent apart from himself included commander of the <a href="Vietnam_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Vietnam Air Force</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Nguyen_Cao_Ky" title="wikilink">Nguyen Cao Ky</a>, commander of <a href="I_Corps_(South_Vietnam)" title="wikilink">I Corps</a> General <a href="Nguyen_Chanh_Thi" title="wikilink">Nguyen Chanh Thi</a> and Admiral <a href="Chung_Tan_Cang" title="wikilink">Chung Tan Cang</a>, the head of the <a href="Republic_of_Vietnam_Navy" title="wikilink">Republic of Vietnam Navy</a>. They and Khanh wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective, but most importantly, as rivals for power. Specific targets of this proposed policy were Generals Minh, <a href="Tran_Van_Don" title="wikilink">Tran Van Don</a>, <a href="Le_Van_Kim" title="wikilink">Le Van Kim</a> and <a href="Mai_Huu_Xuan" title="wikilink">Mai Huu Xuan</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The signature of Chief of State <a href="Phan_Khac_Suu" title="wikilink">Phan Khac Suu</a> was required to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the High National Council, an appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated to be due to the fact that many of the HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> On December 19, the generals dissolved the HNC and arrested some of the members as well as other civilian politicians.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> This prompted US Ambassador <a href="Maxwell_D._Taylor" title="wikilink">Maxwell D.

However, this galvanized the officers around Khanh for a time and they ignored Taylor's threats without repercussions as the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p>Thieu was again plotting the following month when the junta-appointed Prime Minister <a href="Tran_Van_Huong" title="wikilink">Tran Van Huong</a> introduced a series of war expansion measures, notably by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-Huong demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and pro-negotiations Buddhists.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Reliant on Buddhist support, Khanh did little to try to contain the protests,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> and then decided to have the armed forces take over the government, and he removed Huong on 27 January.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Khanh's action nullified a counter-plot involving Huong that had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Huong had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers including Thieu and Co. They planned to remove Khanh and bring Khiem back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim as Taylor and Khanh had become implacable enemies,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> but they did not fully back the move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters between Saigon and Washington, and as a result, they only promised asylum for Huong if necessary.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The plotting continued over the next month with US encouragement, especially when evidence emerged that Khanh wanted to make a deal with the communists.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Taylor told the generals that the US was &quot;in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> At this stage, Taylor and his staff in Saigon thought highly of Thieu, Co and Cang as possible replacements for Khanh.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Thieu was quoted in a <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) report as being described by an unnamed American official as &quot;intelligent, highly ambitious, and likely to remain a coup plotter with the aim of personal advancement&quot;.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Thieu took a cautious approach, as did Co and Cang, and they were pre-empted by Colonel <a href="Pham_Ngoc_Thao" title="wikilink">Pham Ngoc Thao</a>, an undetected communist spy who launched a coup with Phat on a hardline Catholic platform without US backing.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> With US support against both Khanh and the plotters, Ky and Thi put down the coup attempt and then ousted Khanh. This left Ky, Thi and Thieu as the three most prominent members in the new junta.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>There were claims that Thieu ordered the military to capture and extrajudicially kill Colonel <a href="Pham_Ngoc_Thao" title="wikilink">Pham Ngoc Thao</a>, who died in 1965 after a series of coup attempts between various ARVN officers.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> During this period, Thieu gradually became more prominent as other generals fought and defeated one another in coups, which forced several into exile.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="figurehead-chief-of-state">Figurehead chief of state</h2>
<p>In mid 1965, Thieu became the figurehead chief of state of a military junta, with <a href="Nguyen_Cao_Ky" title="wikilink">Nguyen Cao Ky</a> as the prime minister. After a series of short-lived juntas, their pairing put an end to a series of leadership changes that had occurred since Diem's demise.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Ky and Thieu's military junta decided to inaugurate their rule by holding a &quot;no breathing week&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> They imposed censorship, closed many newspapers that published material deemed unacceptable, and suspended civil liberties. They then sidelined the civilian politicians to a &quot;village of old trees&quot; to &quot;conduct seminars and draw up plans and programs in support of government policy&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> They decided to ignore religious and other opposition groups &quot;with the stipulation that troublemakers will be shot&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Ky and Thieu were more concerned with attacking the communists than their predecessors. The generals began to mobilize the populace into paramilitary organizations. After one month, Thich Tri Quang began to call for the removal of Thieu because he was a member of Diem's Catholic <a href="Can_Lao_Party" title="wikilink">Can Lao Party</a>, decrying his &quot;fascistic tendencies&quot;, and claiming that Can Lao members were undermining Ky.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>For Thich Tri Quang, Thieu, was a symbol of the Diem era of Catholic domination, when advancement was based on religion. He had desired that General Thi, known for his pro-Buddhist position would lead the country, and denounced Thieu for his alleged past crimes against Buddhists.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1966, with Ky leading the way, Thi was sacked in a power struggle, provoking widespread civil unrest in his base in I Corps; Thich Tri Quang led Buddhist protests against Ky and Thieu and many units in I Corps began disobeying orders, siding with Thi and the Buddhist movement. Eventually, Ky's military forces forced the dissidents to back down and defeated those who did not. Thi was exiled and Thich Tri Quang put under house arrest, ending Buddhist opposition and any effective threat to Ky and Thieu's regime.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="presidential-election">1967 Presidential election</h2>
<p>Under US insistence for constitutional rule, elections for the presidency and legislature were scheduled.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 3, 1967, Thieu ran successfully for the presidency with Ky as his running mate. Thieu took 34% of the vote and held that position until April 21, 1975.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu promised democracy, social reform and vowed to &quot;open wide the door of peace and leave it open&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> However, the poll was the start of a power struggle with Ky, who had been the main leader of South Vietnam in the preceding two years. The military had decided that they would support one candidate, and after both men wanted the job, Ky would only back down after being promised real influence behind the scenes through a military committee that would control proceedings. However, Thieu was intent to concentrating power into his own hands.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="tet-offensive">Tet Offensive</h2>

<p>During the Lunar New Year of 1968, the communists launched a massive attack on the cities of Vietnam in an attempt to topple Thieu and reunify the country under their rule. At the time of the attack on Saigon, Thieu was out of town, having travelled too celebrate the new year at his wife's family's home at <a href="My_Tho" title="wikilink">My Tho</a> in the <a href="Mekong_Delta" title="wikilink">Mekong Delta</a>. Ky, who was still in the capital, stepped into the spotlight and took command, organising the military forces in Saigon in the battle. The ARVN and the Americans repelled the communist onslaught.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Ky's overshadowing of his superior during South Vietnam's deepest crisis further strained relations between the two men.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the communists were repelled and suffered heavy losses, South Vietnam suffered heavily as the conflict reached the cities for the first time in a substantial way. As ARVN troops were pulled back to defend the towns, the Vietcong gained in the countryside.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> The violence and destruction witnessed damaged public confidence in Thieu, who apparently could not protect the citizens.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu's regime estimated the civilian dead at 14,300 with 24,000 wounded.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> 630,000 new refugees had been generated, joining the nearly 800,000 others already displaced by the war. By the end of 1968, 8% of the populace was living in a refugee camp.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> More than 70,000 homes had been destroyed and the nation's infrastructure was severely damaged.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> 1968 became the deadliest year of the war to date for South Vietnam, with 27,915 men killed.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>In the wake of the offensive, however, Thieu's regime became more energetic.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> On 1 February Thieu declared a state of martial law,<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> and in June, the National Assembly approved his request for a general mobilization of the population and the induction of 200,000 draftees into the armed forces by the end of the year;<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> the bill had been blocked before the Tet Offensive.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> This would increase South Vietnam's military to more than 900,000 men.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Mobilization and token anti-corruption campaigns were carried out. Three of the four ARVN corps commanders, were replaced for poor performance during the offensive. Thieu also established a National Recovery Committee to oversee food distribution, resettlement, and housing construction for the new refugees. Both the government perceived a new determination among the ordinary citizens,<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> especially among previously apathetic urbanites who were angered by the communist attacks.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1971, Thi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;u ran for re-election, but his reputation for corruption made his political opponents believe the poll would be rigged, and they declined to run.

<p>The signing of the <a href="Paris_Peace_Accords" title="wikilink">Paris Peace Accords</a> in March 1973 failed to end the fighting in South Vietnam, as both sides immediately violated the cease-fire and attempted to make territorial gains, resulting in large battles.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>In late-1973, the communists made <em>Resolution 21</em>, which called for &quot;strategic raids&quot; against South Vietnam to gain territory and to gauge the reaction of Thieu and the American government.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> This started between March and November 1974,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> when the communists attacked Quang Duc Province and <a href="Bien_Hoa" title="wikilink">Bien Hoa</a>.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> The US failed to respond to the communist violations and the ARVN lost a lot of supplies in the fighting.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu expressed his stance on the ceasefire by publicly proclaiming the &quot;Four Nos&quot;:<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> no negotiations with the communists; no communist political activities south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ); no coalition government; and no surrender of territory to the North Vietnamese or <a href="Provisional_Revolutionary_Government" title="wikilink">Provisional Revolutionary Government</a> (PRG), which went against the deal.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Thieu still believed the American promise to reintroduce air power against the communists if they made any serious violations of the agreement took place,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> and he and his government also assumed that U.S. aid would continue to be forthcoming at previous levels.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 July 1973, however, the US Congress passed legislation that all but prohibited any U.S. combat activities over or in <a href="Laos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laos</a>, <a href="Cambodia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambodia</a>, and Vietnam.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> On 7 November the legislative branch overrode Nixon's veto of the <a href="War_Powers_Act" title="wikilink">War Powers Act</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> In 1973–74, US funding was slashed to $965 million, a reduction of more than 50%.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Despite the American president's growing political difficulties and an increasingly hostile working relationship with the legislature over Vietnam,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Thieu and most of the Saigon leadership remained optimistic about ongoing aid.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> According to Vietnamese Air Force General <a href="Dong_Van_Khuyen" title="wikilink">Dong Van Khuyen</a>, &quot;Our leaders continued to believe in U.S. air intervention even after the U.S. Congress had expressly forbidden it...They deluded themselves.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>As North Vietnam needed to replenish its armed forces in 1974, Thieu decided to go on the attack. He stretched his own forces thinly by launching offensives that regained most of the territory captured by PAVN forces during the 1973 campaign, and retook 15% of the total land area controlled by the communists at the time of the cease-fire.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> In April, Thieu launched the <a href="Battle_of_Svay_Rieng" title="wikilink">Svay Rieng Campaign</a> against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia near <a href="Tay_Ninh" title="wikilink">Tay Ninh</a>, in what was the last major ARVN offensive. While these operations were successful,<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> the cost in terms of manpower and resources was high. By the end of the year the military was experiencing equipment shortages as a result of decreased American aid,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> while communist forces continued to gain strength.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of October, the North Vietnamese had formulated its strategy for 1975 and 1976. In what became known as <em>Resolution of 1975</em>, the party leadership reported that the war had reached its &quot;final stage&quot;.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The army was to consolidate its gains, eliminate South Vietnamese border outposts and secure its logistical corridor, and continue its force build-up in the south.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> During 1976 the final general offensive would begin.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> The communists decided to start by attacking <a href="Phuoc_Long_Province" title="wikilink">Phuoc Long Province</a>, around 140 km north of Saigon.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>In the meantime, morale in and supplies for the ARVN continued to fade away.

<p>The aid cuts meant that an artillery piece could only fire four rounds a day,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> and each soldier had only 85 bullets per month.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Because of lack of fuel and spare parts, air force transport operations shrank by up to 70%.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Due to Thieu's insistence on not surrendering any territory, the army was spread very thin defending useless terrain along a  frontier, while the strategic reserve was occupied in static defensive roles.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> The situation was exacerbated by the collapse of the economy and a massive influx of refugees into the cities.

<p>In the face of rapid communist advances, Thieu had sent a delegation to Washington in early March to request an increase in aid. The U.S. Ambassador <a href="Graham_Martin" title="wikilink">Graham Martin</a> also traveled to Washington to present the case to President <a href="Gerald_Ford" title="wikilink">Gerald Ford</a>. However, the U.S. Congress, increasingly reluctant to invest in what was seen as a lost cause, slashed a proposed $1.45 billion military aid package for 1975 to $700 million.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The Ford administration, however, continued to encourage Thieu to hbelieve that money would eventually come.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>During this time Thieu was feeling the increased pressure and became increasingly paranoid.

<p><img src="HCMC3.jpg" title="fig:President Thieu&#39;s briefing map" alt="President Thieu&#39;s briefing map" width="150" /> By 11 March, Thieu had concluded that there was no hope of receiving the $300 million supplemental aid package from the US.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a><a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> On that basis he called a meeting attended by Lieutenant General <a href="Dang_Van_Quang" title="wikilink">Dang Van Quang</a> and General Vien.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> After reviewing the situation, Thieu pulled out a small-scale map of South Vietnam and discussed the possible redeployment of the armed forces to &quot;hold and defend only those populous and flourishing areas which were really most important.&quot;<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Thieu then sketched on the map those areas which he considered most important, III and IV Corps.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> He also pointed out those areas that were currently under communist control which would have to be retaken.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The key to the location of these operations were concentrations of natural resources such as rice, rubber and industries. The necessary territory included coastal areas where oil had been discovered on the continental shelf.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> These areas were to become, in Thieu's words: &quot;Our untouchable heartland, the irreducible national stronghold.&quot;<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> With respect to the I and II Corps Zones, he drew a series of phase lines on the map indicating that South Vietnamese forces should hold what they could,<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> but that they could redeploy southward if needed. Thieu declared this new strategy as &quot;Light at the top, heavy on the bottom.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>The critical decision was made on March 14 when Thieu met Phu. Thieu had decided to abandon Pleiku and Kontum so that the II Corps forces could concentrate on retaking Ban Me Thuot, which he considered more important.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> Phu then decided that the only possible means of doing this was to retreat to the coast along Interprovincial Route 7B, a dilapidated, rough track with several downed bridges, before recuperating and counterattacking back into the highlands.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
<p>The large-scale retreat of hundreds of thousands of military personnel and civilians would be dangerous. However, it was poorly planned, many senior officers were not kept informed, and some units were left behind or retreated incoherently. This was exacerbated by a three-day delay when the convoy encountered a broken bridge and had to rebuild it.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> The communist forces caught up, surrounded the convoy, and attacked it.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a><a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>

<p>The planned operation to retake Ban Me Thuot never materialized simply because II Corps had been reduced to only 25% strength.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> Buoyed by their easy triumph the North Vietnamese overran the whole region.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>

<p>However, a worse collapse occurred in the northernmost I Corps, after a series of backflips by Thieu. It added to the fall of the highlands, which had already earned Thieu much criticism.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>

Offshore oil deposits were thought to be nearby.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Thieu also decided to remove the Airborne and Marines, leaving I Corps exposed.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a><a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu called Truong to Saigon on 19 March to detail his withdrawal plan.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> The president then stunned Truong by announcing that he had misinterpreted his previous orders:<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> The old imperial capital of Hue was not to be abandoned, despite losing two divisions.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a><a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<p>In the meantime, the withdrawal preparations and the increasing North Vietnamese pressure caused civilians to flee, clogging the highway and hampering the withdrawal.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Truong then requested permission for a withdrawal of his forces into the three enclaves as planned; Thieu's ordered him to &quot;hold onto any territory he could with whatever forces he now had, including the Marine Division&quot;, implying that he could retreat if needed.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Truong returned to Da Nang to the start of a North Vietnamese offensive.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> President Thieu made a nationwide radio broadcast that afternoon proclaiming that Hue would be held &quot;at all costs&quot;,<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> contradicting the previous order. That evening Truong ordered a retreat to a new defense line at the My Chanh River to defend Hue,<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> thereby ceding all of Quang Tri Province. He was confident that his forces could hold Hue, but was then astounded by a late afternoon message from Thieu that ordered &quot;that because of inability to simultaneously defend all three enclaves, the I Corps commander was free...to redeploy his forces for the defense of Da Nang only.&quot;<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a><a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a><a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> The people of Quang Tri and Hue began to leave their homes by the hundreds of thousands, joining an ever-growing exodus toward Da Nang.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a></p>

<p>As anarchy and looting enveloped Da Nang, and a defense of the city becoming impossible, Truong requested permission to evacuate by sea, but Thieu, baffled, refused to make a decision.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a><a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> When his communications with Saigon were sundered by communist shelling, Truong ordered a naval withdrawal, as Thieu was not making a decision either way.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a><a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a></p>
<p>With no support or leadership from Thieu, the evacuation turned into a costly debacle, as the communists pounded the city with artillery, killing tens of thousands.

<p>He settled in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. He obtained a visa there because his son was studying at <a href="Eton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eton</a>.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> Thieu kept a low profile, and in 1990 even the Foreign Office claimed to have no information on his whereabouts.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Thieu took up residence in <a href="Foxborough,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Foxborough, Massachusetts</a>. Thieu lived reclusively in Massachusetts, and took his secrets with him in death. He never produced an autobiography, and rarely assented to interviews and shunned visitors. Neighbors had little contact or knowledge of him, aside from seeing him walking his dog.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> Thieu's aversion to public appearances were attributed to a fear of hostility from South Vietnamese who believed that he failed them.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> Thieu acknowledged his compatriots' low esteem of his administration in a 1992 interview, but said &quot;You say that you blame me for the fall of South Vietnam, you criticize me, everything. I let you do that. I like to see you do better than I.&quot;<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> The Vietnamese American community heckled Thieu at a rare speech he delivered in <a href="Orange_County" title="wikilink">Orange County</a>—the area with the most Vietnamese in the country—in the early 1990s.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a></p>
<p>Thieu continually predicted the demise of the Vietnamese Communist Party's grip on power and warned against the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the communist regime; however <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> did so in 1995.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> Thieu said that when the communists were deposed and when &quot;democracy is recovered&quot; that he would return to homeland, but their hold on Vietnam remained unchallenged during his life.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a> He offered to represent the refugee community in reconciliation talks with Hanoi to allow exiles to return home, but was ignored by the communist hierarchy.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a></p>
<p>He died in 2001 at <a href="Beth_Israel_Deaconess_Medical_Center" title="wikilink">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</a> after collapsing at his Foxborough home and being put on a respirator.<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a><a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a></p>
<p>He was cremated and buried in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="wife">Wife</h2>
<p>In 1951, Thieu married Nguyen Thi Mai Anh, the daughter of a wealthy <a href="herbal_medicine" title="wikilink">herbal medicine</a> practitioner from the Mekong Delta. She was a Roman Catholic, and Thieu converted in 1958. Critics claimed that Thieu did so in order to inprove his prospects of rising up the military ranks, as Diem was known to discriminate in favor of Catholics.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a><a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> The couple had two sons and one daughter.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a></p>
