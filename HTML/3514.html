<p>&quot;<strong>Twenty-Five Miles</strong>&quot; is a song written by <a href="Johnny_Bristol" title="wikilink">Johnny Bristol</a>, <a href="Harvey_Fuqua" title="wikilink">Harvey Fuqua</a>, and <a href="Edwin_Starr" title="wikilink">Edwin Starr</a> for Starr's second album, <em>25 Miles</em> (1968). The song reached #6 on the US singles charts, and #36 in the UK. The song was considered sufficiently similar to &quot;32 Miles out of Waycross&quot; by Hoagy Lands (also recorded as &quot;Mojo Mama&quot; by both Wilson Picket and Don Varner), written by <a href="Bert_Berns" title="wikilink">Bert Berns</a> and <a href="Jerry_Ragovoy" title="wikilink">Jerry Ragovoy</a>, that Berns and Ragovoy were eventually given co-writing credits.</p>

It was not the original recording, however, as it included drum machine overdubs.</p>
