<p><strong>Llano Estacado</strong> (<a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Sp.</a> , &quot;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palisade">Palisaded</a> Plains&quot;) is a region in the southwestern <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> that encompasses parts of <a href="eastern_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">eastern New Mexico</a> and northwestern <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, including the <a href="South_Plains" title="wikilink">South Plains</a> and parts of the <a href="Texas_Panhandle" title="wikilink">Texas Panhandle</a>. It is a large <a href="mesa" class="uri" title="wikilink">mesa</a>, or tableland; while the elevation rises from 3000 ft in the southeast to over 5000 ft in the northwest, sloping almost uniformly at about 10 feet per mile, the elevation change is imperceptible to the observer, making the landscape appear almost completely flat.</p>
<h2 id="geography-and-climate">Geography and climate</h2>
<p>The Llano Estacado lies at the southern end of the <a href="High_Plains_(United_States)" title="wikilink">High Plains</a> section of the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> and is part of what was once called the <a href="Great_American_Desert" title="wikilink">Great American Desert</a>. The <a href="Canadian_River" title="wikilink">Canadian River</a> forms the Llano's northern boundary, separating it from the rest of the High Plains. To the east, the <a href="Caprock_Escarpment" title="wikilink">Caprock Escarpment</a>, a precipitous cliff about 300 ft high, lies between the Llano and the red Permian plains of Texas, while to the west, the <a href="Mescalero_Escarpment" title="wikilink">Mescalero Escarpment</a> demarcates the edge of the <a href="Pecos_River" title="wikilink">Pecos River</a> valley. The Llano has no natural southern boundary, instead blending into the <a href="Edwards_Plateau" title="wikilink">Edwards Plateau</a> near <a href="Big_Spring,_Texas" title="wikilink">Big Spring, Texas</a>. This geographic area stretches about 250 mi north to south, and 150 mi east to west, a total area of some 37,500 sq mi, larger than all of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>, and covering all or part of thirty-three Texas counties and four New Mexico counties.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Llano Estacado has a <a href="semi-arid_climate" title="wikilink">semi-arid climate</a> (<a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen_climate_classification" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen</a> <em>Bsk</em>), characterized by long hot summers and cold winters. Rainfall is extremely low; the entire region receives less than 23&quot; of rainfall annually, and the western part receives as little as 14&quot;. High summer temperatures (average July temperature above 85&lt;U+00B0&gt; F) mean that most of this already-small amount of precipitation is lost to evaporation, making dry-land farming extremely difficult.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>All the agriculture-enabling water visible on the Llano today is brought to the surface by electrical pumps. Before electricity, grazing was possible and large ranches existed. However, grazing soon destroyed the fragile grass. The scanty rainfall simply evaporates or disappears into the porous soil, and cannot refill the parched aquifer at the rate it is being depleted. There are no nearby sources of abundant water, and the Pecos runs nearly dry from irrigation diversions. When the store of water is gone, there will be no more to support the large cities of Lubbock and Amarillo. There was a permanent oasis, Monument Spring, not far from Hobbs, New Mexico, that was one of the rare watering places. The &quot;monument&quot; was a pile of caliche raised by the Native Americans to guide people to the spot.</p>
<h2 id="history-and-name">History and name</h2>
<p>The region's name was given to the region by Coronado himself, when he saw the cliffs of the Caprock Escarpment from the north on his way east from <a href="C&lt;U+00ED&gt;bola" class="uri" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00ED&gt;bola</a>, appearing to him as an impenetrable defense for the land and leading him to dub it the <em>Llano Estacado</em>, <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> for &quot;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palisade">Palisaded</a> Plains.&quot; The name is often mistranslated as &quot;<em>staked</em> plain,&quot; and fanciful stories have been created to explain this title. Some allude to <a href="yucca" class="uri" title="wikilink">yucca</a> stems, others to actual stakes driven into the ground as landmarks, and still others to similar, even less plausible objects. None of these have ever been evident enough to be responsible for the name, especially not to Coronado riding along the Canadian.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <img src="Caprock_Escarpment.jpg" title="fig:The Caprock Escarpment as seen from its eastern side, facing north from just outside Dickens, Texas." alt="The Caprock Escarpment as seen from its eastern side, facing north from just outside Dickens, Texas." width="500" /></p>
<p>The <a href="horse" title="wikilink">horses</a> of the conquistadors were the first to return to the Great Plains since their extinction in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> eons earlier. Some horses would escape, thus giving horses to some of the <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Native American</a> tribes in the succeeding centuries. Before this, the <a href="dog" class="uri" title="wikilink">dog</a> was their largest <a href="Domestication" title="wikilink">domesticated</a> animal.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a>, the Llano was then a refuge for the bands of <a href="Kiowa" title="wikilink">Kiowas</a> and <a href="Comanche" title="wikilink">Comanches</a> who did not wish to be cooped up in <a href="Oklahoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>. One of the last battles was fought in bitter cold on 2 December <a href="1874" class="uri" title="wikilink">1874</a> in <a href="Palo_Duro_Canyon" title="wikilink">Palo Duro Canyon</a>. The waterless surface was very difficult for the U.S. Cavalry to cope with, and it was easy to disappear into the slight draws of its featureless expanse, or into the labyrinths of canyons like Palo Duro.</p>

<p><img src="Texas_population_map.png" title="fig:Map of Texas counties with population density." alt="Map of Texas counties with population density." width="350" /> The Llano Estacado has an extremely low population density, as can be seen in the map to the right; most of the area's population is localized in the principal cities of <a href="Amarillo,_Texas" title="wikilink">Amarillo</a>, <a href="Lubbock,_Texas" title="wikilink">Lubbock</a>, and <a href="Midland,_Texas" title="wikilink">Midland</a>/<a href="Odessa,_Texas" title="wikilink">Odessa</a>, Texas. The vast majority of the area is rural, covered by large ranches and irrigated farms. Several small- to medium-sized towns do exist, however, including <a href="Plainview,_Texas" title="wikilink">Plainview</a>, <a href="Levelland,_Texas" title="wikilink">Levelland</a>, and <a href="Lamesa,_Texas" title="wikilink">Lamesa</a>, Texas and <a href="Clovis,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Clovis</a> and <a href="Hobbs,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Hobbs</a>, New Mexico.<img src="Downtown_Lubbock_from_I-27_2005-09-10.jpeg" title="fig:Lubbock, TX, the largest city on the Llano" alt="Lubbock, TX, the largest city on the Llano" width="240" /></p>
<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>
<p>The Ogallala Group is a late <a href="Tertiary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tertiary</a> (<a href="Pliocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pliocene</a>) sheet of sediments spread over the area east of the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> from Wyoming to Texas, rather recently in a geological sense, when the Colorado Plateau and Rocky Mountain regions were elevated from near sea level to about their current elevations, and the eroded sediments (mainly earlier Tertiary rocks) spread over the low plains to the east. The Rocky Mountains had been formed much earlier, at the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Tertiary eras, and had been worn down to near flatness before the late Tertiary uplift. In the northern areas, the Ogallala was spread over earlier Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks, but in the Llano Estacado area erosion had removed everything down to the <a href="Triassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triassic</a>, and even to the <a href="Permian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Permian</a> redbeds. At the southern end, some <a href="Cretaceous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cretaceous</a> limestone remained, however. The Ogallala was laid down over all of this by lazy, sandy streams near sea level, which produced the flatness of its surface. Subsequently, the uplift to the west progressed to the east, raising and tilting the Ogallala surface to its present position, and changing the environment from depositional to erosional. Some major rivers, such as the <a href="Pecos_river" title="wikilink">Pecos</a> and Canadian, incised their courses deeply as the region was elevated, while others, such as the <a href="Red_River_(Mississippi_watershed)" title="wikilink">Red</a>, <a href="Brazos_river" title="wikilink">Brazos</a>, and <a href="Colorado_river" title="wikilink">Colorado</a>, arose on the dip slope. The erosion of these rivers has now defined the area of the Llano Estacado, separating it from its Rocky Mountain sources and from other parts of the High Plains.</p>
<p>Other areas of the Ogallala surface, or High Plains, have the same history. In <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>, it is still in contact with the mountains west of Cheyenne (the &quot;Gangplank&quot;), but elsewhere it is separated from the mountains by valleys of Cretaceous and earlier rocks due to active erosion at these higher levels. Only in the Llano Estacado area has the formation of the Caprock given rise to a prominent, distinctive, palisade-like escarpment, as well as to a remarkably flat surface; further north, rivers such as the <a href="Platte_River" title="wikilink">Platte</a>, <a href="Arkansas_river" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a>, and <a href="Cimarron_River" title="wikilink">Cimarron</a> have sliced it into segments.</p>
<p>Another distinctive characteristic is that the surrounding rocks are often red, as in Palo Duro Canyon, making a striking contrast with the light-colored rocks of the plateau. In some other places, the erosional edge of the High Plains is marked by &quot;breaks&quot; or other abrupt changes of scenery, as in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. In these areas, the High Plains are usually sandy, rolling plains with normal, branching drainage, not flat surfaces without continuous streams.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogeology"><a href="Hydrogeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hydrogeology</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;bedrock&quot; of the plain is the indurated top of the <a href="Ogallala_Group" title="wikilink">Ogallala Group</a>, a hard <a href="caliche" class="uri" title="wikilink">caliche</a> layer called the Caprock. This was formed when surface drying caused mineral-laden water to rise by capillary action to the surface. Evaporating, the minerals were left behind to cement the otherwise fairly loose sandy sediments of the Ogallala Group. The Caprock is generally covered by sands and soils. Where soils predominate, the land is fertile when irrigated, and is devoted to field crops, including grain and cotton. Irrigation water is mined from the deeper parts of the Ogallala Group by electric pumps, since there is almost no usable surface water. The pumped water is used much more rapidly than it is replenished,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> so eventually the Llano will return to its natural state of sparse grassland, minus its subterranean water, gas, and oil.</p>
