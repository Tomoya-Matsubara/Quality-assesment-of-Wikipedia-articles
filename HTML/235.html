<p>]] Sir <strong>Harold Malcolm Watts Sargent</strong> (29 April 1895 – 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer widely regarded as Britain's leading conductor of choral works.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The musical ensembles with which he was associated included the <a href="Ballets_Russes" title="wikilink">Ballets Russes</a>, the <a href="Royal_Choral_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Choral Society</a>, the <a href="D&#39;Oyly_Carte_Opera_Company" title="wikilink">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a>, and the <a href="London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Philharmonic</a>, <a href="The_Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, <a href="Royal_Liverpool_Philharmonic" title="wikilink">Liverpool Philharmonic</a>, <a href="BBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">BBC Symphony</a> and <a href="Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Royal Philharmonic</a> orchestras. Sargent was held in high esteem by choirs and instrumental soloists, but because of his high standards and a statement that he made in a 1936 interview about musicians' rights to tenure, his relationship with orchestral players was often uneasy. Despite this, he was co-founder of the London Philharmonic, was the first conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic as a full-time ensemble, and played an important part in saving the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from disbandment in the 1960s.</p>
<p>As chief conductor of London's internationally famous summer music festival <a href="the_Proms" title="wikilink">the Proms</a> from 1948 to 1967, Sargent was one of the best-known English conductors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When he took over the Proms from their founder, <a href="Henry_Joseph_Wood" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Wood</a>, he and two assistants conducted the two-month season between them. By the time he died, he was assisted by a large international roster of guest conductors.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Sargent turned down an offer of a major musical directorship in Australia and returned to the UK to bring music to as many people as possible as his contribution to national morale. His fame extended beyond the concert hall: to the British public, he was a familiar broadcaster in <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> radio talk shows, and generations of <a href="Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> devotees have known his recordings of the most popular <a href="Savoy_Opera" title="wikilink">Savoy Operas</a>. He toured widely throughout the world and was noted for his skill as a conductor, his championship of British composers, and his debonair appearance, which won him the nickname &quot;Flash Harry.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="life-and-career">Life and career</h2>
<p>Sargent was born in Bath Villas, <a href="Ashford,_Kent" title="wikilink">Ashford</a>, in <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>, England, to a working-class family. His father, Henry Sargent, was a coal merchant, amateur musician and part-time church organist; his mother, Agnes, <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Hall, was the matron of a local school. Sargent was brought up in <a href="Stamford,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Stamford, Lincolnshire</a>, where he joined the choir at <a href="Peterborough_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Peterborough Cathedral</a>, studied the <a href="organ_(music)" title="wikilink">organ</a> and won a scholarship to <a href="Stamford_School" title="wikilink">Stamford School</a>. At the age of 14, he accompanied rehearsals for amateur productions of <em><a href="The_Gondoliers" title="wikilink">The Gondoliers</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Yeomen_of_the_Guard" title="wikilink">The Yeomen of the Guard</a></em> at Stamford.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At age 16, he earned his diploma as Associate of the <a href="Royal_College_of_Organists" title="wikilink">Royal College of Organists</a>, and at 18, he was awarded the degree of <a href="Bachelor_of_Music" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Music</a> by the <a href="University_of_Durham" title="wikilink">University of Durham</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Sargent's break came when <a href="Henry_Joseph_Wood" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Wood</a> visited <a href="De_Montfort_Hall" title="wikilink">De Montfort Hall</a>, <a href="Leicester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leicester</a>, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was customary to commission a piece from a local composer, Wood commissioned Sargent to write a piece entitled <em>Impression on a Windy Day</em>. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to have enough time to learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as <a href="the_Proms" title="wikilink">the Proms</a>, in the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Hall" title="wikilink">Queen's Hall</a> on 11 October of the same year.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Sargent as composer attracted favourable notice in a Prom season when other composer-conductors included <a href="Gustav_Holst" title="wikilink">Gustav Holst</a> with his <em><a href="The_Planets" title="wikilink">Planets</a></em> suite, and the next year, Wood included a <a href="nocturne" class="uri" title="wikilink">nocturne</a> and <a href="scherzo" class="uri" title="wikilink">scherzo</a> by Sargent in the Proms programme, also conducted by the composer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Sargent was invited to conduct the <em>Impression</em> again in the 1923 season, but it was as a conductor that he made the greater impact.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On the advice of Wood, among others, he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922, which he continued to conduct until 1939. Under Sargent, the orchestra's prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top-flight soloists as <a href="Alfred_Cortot" title="wikilink">Alfred Cortot</a>, <a href="Artur_Schnabel" title="wikilink">Artur Schnabel</a>, <a href="Solomon_(pianist)" title="wikilink">Solomon</a>, <a href="Guilhermina_Suggia" title="wikilink">Guilhermina Suggia</a> and <a href="Benno_Moiseiwitsch" title="wikilink">Benno Moiseiwitsch</a>. Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge, judging him talented enough to make a successful career as a concert pianist.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> At the instigation of Wood and <a href="Adrian_Boult" title="wikilink">Adrian Boult</a>, however, Sargent became a lecturer at the <a href="Royal_College_of_Music" title="wikilink">Royal College of Music</a> in London in 1923.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Mikado_Ricketts.jpg" title="fig:New costume for The Mikado 1926" alt="New costume for The Mikado 1926" width="200" /> In the 1920s, Sargent became one of the best-known English conductors.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> For the <a href="British_National_Opera_Company" title="wikilink">British National Opera Company</a>, he conducted <em><a href="Die_Meistersinger_von_N&lt;U+00FC&gt;rnberg" title="wikilink">Die Meistersinger von N&lt;U+00FC&gt;rnberg</a></em> on tour in 1925,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and for the <a href="D&#39;Oyly_Carte_Opera_Company" title="wikilink">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a>, he conducted London seasons at the <a href="Prince&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">Prince's Theatre</a> in 1926 and the newly-rebuilt <a href="Savoy_Theatre" title="wikilink">Savoy Theatre</a> in 1929-30. Sargent was criticised by <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times's</a></em> review of 20 September 1926 for adding &quot;gags&quot; to the Gilbert and Sullivan scores, although it praised the crispness of the ensemble, the &quot;musicalness&quot; of the performance and the beauty of the overture.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="Rupert_D&#39;Oyly_Carte" title="wikilink">Rupert D'Oyly Carte</a> wrote to the paper stating that, in fact, Sargent had worked from <a href="Arthur_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Arthur Sullivan</a>'s manuscript scores and had merely brought out the &quot;details of the orchestration&quot; exactly as Sullivan had written them.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Some of the principal cast members and the stage director, <a href="J._M._Gordon" title="wikilink">J. M. Gordon</a>, also objected to Sargent's fast tempi, at least at first.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The D'Oyly Carte seasons brought Sargent's name to a wider public with an early <a href="BBC_radio" title="wikilink">BBC radio</a> relay of <em><a href="The_Mikado" title="wikilink">The Mikado</a></em> in 1926 heard by up to eight million people. The <em><a href="Evening_Standard" title="wikilink">Evening Standard</a></em> noted that this was &quot;probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1927, <a href="Sergei_Diaghilev" title="wikilink">Sergei Diaghilev</a> engaged Sargent to conduct for the <a href="Ballets_Russes" title="wikilink">Ballets Russes</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> sharing the conducting duties with <a href="Igor_Stravinsky" title="wikilink">Igor Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Thomas_Beecham" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Sargent also conducted for the final Ballets Russes season in 1928.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1928 he became conductor of the <a href="Royal_Choral_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Choral Society</a>, and he retained this post for four decades until his death. The society was famous in the 1920s and 1930s for staged performances of <a href="Samuel_Coleridge-Taylor" title="wikilink">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a>'s <em><a href="The_Song_of_Hiawatha_(Coleridge-Taylor)" title="wikilink">The Song of Hiawatha</a></em> at the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a>, a work with which Sargent's name soon became synonymous.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><img src="RoyalAlbertHall.jpg" title="fig:Royal Albert Hall" alt="Royal Albert Hall" width="250" /></p>
<p>Elizabeth Courtauld, wife of the industrialist <a href="Samuel_Courtauld_(industrialist)" title="wikilink">Samuel Courtauld</a>, promoted a popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors as eminent as <a href="Bruno_Walter" title="wikilink">Bruno Walter</a>, <a href="Otto_Klemperer" title="wikilink">Otto Klemperer</a> and Stravinsky.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent's name before another section of the public.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by <a href="Arthur_Bliss" title="wikilink">Arthur Bliss</a>, <a href="Arthur_Honegger" title="wikilink">Arthur Honegger</a>, <a href="Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Kod&lt;U+00E1&gt;ly" title="wikilink">Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Kod&lt;U+00E1&gt;ly</a>, <a href="Bohuslav_Martin&lt;U+016F&gt;" title="wikilink">Bohuslav Martin&lt;U+016F&gt;</a>, <a href="Sergei_Prokofiev" title="wikilink">Sergei Prokofiev</a>, <a href="Karol_Szymanowski" title="wikilink">Karol Szymanowski</a> and <a href="William_Walton" title="wikilink">William Walton</a>, among others.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> At first, the plan was to engage the <a href="London_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Symphony Orchestra</a> for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the <a href="London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Philharmonic</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In these years Sargent tackled a wide range of repertoire, recording much of it, but he was particularly noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, as he would throughout his career, conducting <a href="George_Frideric_Handel" title="wikilink">Handel</a>'s <em><a href="Messiah_(Handel)" title="wikilink">Messiah</a></em> performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;res of <em>At the Boar's Head</em> (1925) by <a href="Gustav_Holst" title="wikilink">Gustav Holst</a>; <em><a href="Hugh_the_Drover" title="wikilink">Hugh the Drover</a></em> (1924) and <em>Sir John in Love</em> (1929) by <a href="Ralph_Vaughan_Williams" title="wikilink">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>; and Walton's <a href="oratorio" class="uri" title="wikilink">oratorio</a> <em><a href="Belshazzar&#39;s_Feast_(Walton)" title="wikilink">Belshazzar's Feast</a></em> (at the <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> Triennial Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the <a href="Robert_Mayer" title="wikilink">Robert Mayer</a> Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="difficult-years-and-war-years">Difficult years and war years</h3>
<p>In October 1932, Sargent suffered a near-fatal attack of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> For almost two years he was unable to work, and it was only later in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 1936, he conducted his first opera at <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Covent Garden</a>, <a href="Gustave_Charpentier" title="wikilink">Gustave Charpentier</a>'s <em><a href="Louise_(opera)" title="wikilink">Louise</a></em>. He did not return to the Royal Opera House to conduct opera again until 1954, with Walton's <em><a href="Troilus_and_Cressida_(opera)" title="wikilink">Troilus and Cressida</a></em>,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> although he did conduct the incidental music for a dramatisation of <em><a href="The_Pilgrim&#39;s_Progress" title="wikilink">The Pilgrim's Progress</a></em> given at the Royal Opera House in 1948.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>As an orchestra conductor, the diligent Sargent had already been known as a hard taskmaster. According to <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em>, he brought professionalism to orchestras by shaking them free of dead wood, clearing out talented dilettantes and pushing the survivors to perform at their best through relentless rehearsal.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> After giving a <em><a href="Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Daily Telegraph</a></em> interview in 1936 in which he said that an orchestral musician did not deserve a &quot;job for life&quot; and should &quot;give of his lifeblood with every bar he plays,&quot; Sargent lost much favour with musicians. They were particularly annoyed because of their support of him during his long illness, and Sargent thereafter faced frequent hostility from British orchestras.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Qnshall.jpg" title="fig:Drawing of interior of Queen&#39;s Hall" alt="Drawing of interior of Queen&#39;s Hall" width="250" />Being immensely popular in Australia with players as well as the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> 1938 and 1939.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He was on the verge of accepting a permanent appointment with the <a href="Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> when, at the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> During the war, Sargent directed the <a href="The_Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Hall&lt;U+00E9&gt; Orchestra</a> in <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> (1939-42) and the <a href="Royal_Liverpool_Philharmonic" title="wikilink">Liverpool Philharmonic</a> (1942-48) and became a popular <a href="BBC_Home_Service" title="wikilink">BBC Home Service</a> radio broadcaster.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of <a href="Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony_No._7_(Beethoven)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 7</a>. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of <a href="Edward_Elgar" title="wikilink">Elgar</a>'s <em><a href="The_Dream_of_Gerontius" title="wikilink">The Dream of Gerontius</a></em>, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1945, <a href="Arturo_Toscanini" title="wikilink">Arturo Toscanini</a> invited Sargent to conduct the <a href="NBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a>. In four concerts Sargent chose to present all English music, with the exception of <a href="Jean_Sibelius" title="wikilink">Jean Sibelius</a>'s <a href="Symphony_No._1_(Sibelius)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 1</a> and <a href="Anton&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k" title="wikilink">Anton&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k</a>'s <a href="Symphony_No._7_(Dvo&lt;U+0159&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;k)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 7</a>.

<p>Sargent was <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knighted</a> for his services to music in 1947<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and performed in numerous English-speaking countries during the post-war years. He continued to promote British composers, conducting the premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;res of Walton's <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a>, <em><a href="Troilus_and_Cressida_(opera)" title="wikilink">Troilus and Cressida</a></em> (1954), and <a href="Ralph_Vaughan_Williams" title="wikilink">Vaughan Williams's</a> <a href="Symphony_No._9_(Vaughan_Williams)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 9</a> (1958).</p>
<p><img src="Malocom_Sargent_conducting.jpg" title="fig:Sargent conducting in the 1950s." alt="Sargent conducting in the 1950s." width="250" />Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967 and of the <a href="BBC_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> from 1950 to 1957, succeeding Sir Adrian Boult. One author has written that &quot;Sargent sometimes ruffled the orchestra in a way that Boult had never done. Indeed there were many people inside the BBC who profoundly regretted Boult's departure.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The same author contended that Sargent was the target of criticism from the BBC's own Music Department for &quot;not devoting enough time to the orchestra.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <a href="Norman_Lebrecht" title="wikilink">Norman Lebrecht</a> goes so far as to claim that that Sargent &quot;almost wrecked&quot; the BBC orchestra.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Although the orchestra players bridled at some of Sargent's initiatives, there has been ample praise for Sargent's work with the orchestra. His biographer Reid contended, &quot;Sargent's liveliness and drive soon gave BBC playing a gloss and briskness which had not been conspicuous before.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Another biographer, Aldous, wrote, &quot;Everywhere Sargent and the orchestra performed there were ovations, laurel wreaths and terrific reviews.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The orchestra's reputation both in Britain and internationally grew during Sargent's tenure.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The conductor had &quot;great moments of triumph ... both at festivals overseas and during the Proms.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In the 1950s and 1960s Sargent made many recordings with the BBC Symphony, as well as other ensembles, as described below. In this period, also, he conducted the concerts that opened the <a href="Royal_Festival_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Festival Hall</a> in 1951<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and returned to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for the summer 1951 &quot;<a href="Festival_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Festival of Britain</a>&quot; season at the Savoy Theatre and the winter 1961-62 and 1963-64 seasons at the Savoy. In August 1956 the BBC announced that Sargent would be replaced as Chief Conductor of the BBC orchestra by <a href="Rudolf_Schwarz_(conductor)" title="wikilink">Rudolf Schwarz</a>.

<p>When the <a href="Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a> was in danger of extinction after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent played a major part in saving the orchestra, doing much to win back the good opinion of orchestral players that he had lost because of his 1936 interview.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In the 1960s, Sargent toured Russia, the United States, Canada, <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, India, the <a href="Far_East" title="wikilink">Far East</a> and Australia.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> By the mid-1960s, however, his health began to deteriorate.</p>

<p><a href="Arturo_Toscanini" title="wikilink">Toscanini</a>, <a href="Thomas_Beecham" title="wikilink">Beecham</a> and many others regarded Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, &quot;He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see the eyes of a choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, &quot;[H]e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music &lt;U+2013&gt; he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music.&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Although orchestral players resented Sargent for much of his career after the 1936 interview,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> instrumental soloists generally liked working with him. The cellist Pierre Fournier called him a &quot;guardian angel&quot; and compared him favourably with <a href="George_Szell" title="wikilink">George Szell</a> and <a href="Herbert_von_Karajan" title="wikilink">Herbert von Karajan</a>. <a href="Artur_Schnabel" title="wikilink">Artur Schnabel</a>, <a href="Jascha_Heifetz" title="wikilink">Jascha Heifetz</a> and <a href="Yehudi_Menuhin" title="wikilink">Yehudi Menuhin</a> thought similarly highly of him.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> <a href="Cyril_Smith_(pianist)" title="wikilink">Cyril Smith</a> wrote in his autobiography, &quot;...he seems to sense what the pianist wants of the music even before he begins to play it....

<p><em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> obituary said Sargent &quot;was of all British conductors in his day the most widely esteemed by the lay public... a fluent, attractive pianist, a brilliant score-reader, a skilful and effective arranger and orchestrator... as a conductor his stick technique was regarded by many as the most accomplished and reliable in the world.... [H]is taste... was moulded by the <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> cathedral tradition into which he was born.&quot; It commented that, in his later years, his interpretations of the standard classical and romantic repertoire were &quot;prepared... down to the last detail&quot; but sometimes &quot;unexuberant&quot;, though his performances of &quot;the music composed within his lifetime... remained lucid and continually compelling.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The flute player Gerald Jackson wrote, &quot;I feel that [Walton] conducts his own music as well as anyone else, with the possible exception of Sargent, who of course introduced and always makes a big thing of <em><a href="Belshazzar&#39;s_Feast_(Walton)" title="wikilink">Belshazzar's Feast</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="private-life">Private life</h3>
<p>In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne, daughter of Frederic Horne of Drinkstone, <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states that she was a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes that she was a keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was <a href="rector" class="uri" title="wikilink">rector</a> of Drinkwater, <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who was to die of <a href="polio" class="uri" title="wikilink">polio</a> in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's <em><a href="The_Dream_of_Gerontius" title="wikilink">The Dream of Gerontius</a></em> in 1945 was an expression of his grief at her passing.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Sargent's marriage was unhappy and ended in divorce in 1946. Before, during and after his marriage, Sargent was a continual womaniser, a fact that he did not deny.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> His liaisons with powerful women began early, in Stamford, when he was still conducting the <a href="Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> shows attended by the London gentry who came to join the <a href="Melton_Mowbray" title="wikilink">Melton Mowbray</a> hunt.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Among his affairs were long-standing ones with Diana <a href="John_Herbert_Bowes-Lyon" title="wikilink">Bowes-Lyon</a>, <a href="Princess_Marina,_Duchess_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Princess Marina</a> and <a href="Edwina_Mountbatten" title="wikilink">Edwina Mountbatten</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> More casual encounters are typified by the young woman who said, &quot;Promise me that whatever happens I shan't have to go home alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Away from music, Sargent was elected a member of <a href="The_Literary_Society" title="wikilink">The Literary Society</a>, a dining club founded in 1807 by <a href="William_Wordsworth" title="wikilink">William Wordsworth</a> and others.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He was also a member of the <a href="Beefsteak_Club" title="wikilink">Beefsteak Club</a>, for which his proposer was <a href="Edward_Elgar" title="wikilink">Sir Edward Elgar</a>, the <a href="Garrick_Club" title="wikilink">Garrick</a>, and the long-established and aristocratic <a href="White&#39;s_Club" title="wikilink">White's</a> and Pratt's clubs.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> His public service appointments included the joint presidency of the London Union of Youth Clubs, and the presidency of the <a href="Royal_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals" title="wikilink">Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Sargent's moral character attracted comment throughout his life. Early on, he developed a taste for luxury: Adrian Boult commented on his travelling to college by taxi, but Sargent rejoined, &quot;All the more room for you, Adrian, on the bus.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Despite Sargent's vanities and rivalries, however, he had many friends. <a href="Thomas_Armstrong_(conductor)" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Armstrong</a> in a 1994 broadcast interview stressed that Sargent &quot;had many good generous virtues; he was kind to many people, and I loved him....&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Nevertheless, even friends such as <a href="Rupert_Hart-Davis" title="wikilink">Sir Rupert Hart-Davis</a>, Secretary of the Literary Society, considered him a 'bounder',<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> and the composer-<a href="suffragette" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffragette</a> <a href="Ethel_Smyth" title="wikilink">Dame Ethel Smyth</a> called him a <a href="Rake_(character)" title="wikilink">'cad'</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Yet despite his <a href="philandering" class="uri" title="wikilink">philandering</a> and ambition, Sargent was a deeply religious man all his life and was comforted on his deathbed by visits from the <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>, <a href="Donald_Coggan" title="wikilink">Donald Coggan</a> and the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="Archbishop_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Westminster</a>, <a href="Cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="wikilink">Cardinal</a> <a href="John_Heenan" title="wikilink">Heenan</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> He also received calls from <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Prince Charles</a>, and had a reconciliation with his son, Peter, from whom he had been estranged for a year.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flash-harry">&quot;Flash Harry&quot;</h3>
<p>A number of purported explanations have been advanced for Sargent's <a href="nickname" class="uri" title="wikilink">nickname</a>, &quot;Flash Harry&quot;. Reid opines that it &quot;was first in circulation among orchestral players before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">the war</a> and that they used it in no spirit of adulation.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> It may have arisen from his impeccable and stylish appearance &lt;U+2013&gt; he always wore a red or white <a href="carnation" class="uri" title="wikilink">carnation</a> in his buttonhole (the carnation is now the symbol of the school named for him). This was perhaps reinforced by his brisk tempi early in his career, and by a story about his racing from one recording session to another. Another explanation, that he was named after cartoonist <a href="Ronald_Searle" title="wikilink">Ronald Searle</a>'s <a href="St_Trinian&#39;s_School" title="wikilink">St. Trinian's</a> character &quot;<a href="Flash_Harry_(St_Trinian&#39;s)" title="wikilink">Flash Harry</a>&quot;, is certainly wrong, since Sargent's nickname was current long before the first appearance of the St. Trinian's character in 1954. Sargent's devoted fans, the Promenaders, used the nickname in an approving sense, and shortened it to &quot;Flash&quot;, though Sargent was not especially keen on the soubriquet, even thus modified.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Beecham and Sargent were allies from the early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham's final months when they were planning joint concerts. They even happened to share the same birthday. When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933, Beecham conducted a performance of <em>Messiah</em> at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Sargent loved Beecham's company,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and took in good part his quips, such as his reference to the rising conductor <a href="Herbert_von_Karajan" title="wikilink">Herbert von Karajan</a>, as &quot;a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> and, on learning that Sargent's car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine, &quot;I had no idea the Arabs were so musical.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> However, Beecham declared that Sargent &quot;is the greatest choirmaster we have ever produced... he makes the buggers sing like blazes.&quot; And on another occasion he said that Sargent was &quot;the most expert of all our conductors &lt;U+2013&gt; myself excepted of course.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
