<p>Akheperre Setepenre <strong>Osorkon the Elder</strong> was the fifth king of the <a href="Twenty-first_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">twenty-first dynasty</a> of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and was the first <a href="pharaoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharaoh</a> of Libyan extraction in Egypt. He is also sometimes known as <strong>Osochor</strong>, following <a href="Manetho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manetho</a>'s <em>Aegyptiaca</em>.</p>
<p>Osorkon the Elder was an uncle of <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a>, founder of the <a href="Twenty-second_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Twenty-second Dynasty</a>. His existence was doubted by most scholars until Eric Young established in 1963 that the induction of a temple priest named Nespaneferhor in <strong>Year 2 I Shemu day 20</strong> of a certain king named Akheperre Setepenre—in fragment 3B, line 1-3 of the Karnak Priest Annals —occurred one generation prior to the induction of Hori, Nespaneferhor's son in Year 17 of <a href="Siamun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siamun</a>, which is also recorded in the same annals. Young argued that this king Akheperre Setepenre was the unknown Osochor. This hypothesis was not fully accepted by all Egyptologists at that time. However, Jean Yoyotte (1976&lt;U+2013&gt;1977) noted that a Libyan king named Osorkon was the son of <a href="Shoshenq_A" title="wikilink">Shoshenq A</a> by the Lady Mehtenweshkhet, who is explicitly titled &quot;King's Mother&quot; in a certain geneaological document. Since none of the other king Osorkons had a mother named Mehtenweshkhet, it was conclusively established that Akheperre Setepenre was indeed Manetho's Osochor, whose mother was Mehtenweshkhet. The Lady Mehtenweshet A was also the mother of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the <a href="Meshwesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meshwesh</a> and, thus, <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a>'s grandmother.</p>
<p>Osorkon the Elder's reign is significant because it foreshadows the coming the Libyan Twenty-second dynasty. He is credited with a reign of six Years in <a href="Manetho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manetho</a>'s <em>Aegyptiaca</em> and was succeeded in power by <a href="Siamun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siamun</a>, who was presumably a native Egyptian.</p>
