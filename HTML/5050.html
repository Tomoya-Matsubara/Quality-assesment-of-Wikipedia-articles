<p>The <strong>University of Delaware</strong> (colloquially &quot;<strong>UD</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>UDel</strong>&quot;) is the largest university in <a href="Delaware" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delaware</a>. The main campus is in <a href="Newark,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Newark</a>, with satellite campuses in <a href="Dover,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Dover</a>, <a href="Wilmington,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a>, <a href="Lewes,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Lewes</a> and <a href="Georgetown,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>. It is medium-sized &lt;U+2013&gt; approximately 16,000 undergraduate and 3,500 <a href="graduate_student" title="wikilink">graduate students</a>. Although UD receives public funding for being a <a href="land-grant" class="uri" title="wikilink">land-grant</a>, <a href="sea-grant" class="uri" title="wikilink">sea-grant</a>, <a href="space-grant" class="uri" title="wikilink">space-grant</a> and <a href="urban-grant" class="uri" title="wikilink">urban-grant</a> state-supported research institution, it is also privately <a href="charter" title="wikilink">chartered</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> At present, the school's endowment is valued at about $1.3975 billion US. The University of Delaware is ranked 68th by US News in the category of &quot;Best National Universities.&quot; <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/newark-de/university-of-delaware-1431">1</a> In 2009, UD ranked No. 22 in the in-state category of <a href="Kiplinger&#39;s_Personal_Finance" title="wikilink">Kiplinger's Personal Finance</a> magazine's list of the 100 Best Values in Public Colleges, and No. 18 for out-of-state.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation. However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833. Its original class of ten students included <a href="George_Read_(signer)" title="wikilink">George Read</a>, <a href="Thomas_McKean" title="wikilink">Thomas McKean</a>, and <a href="James_Smith_(political_figure)" title="wikilink">James Smith</a>, all three of whom would go on to sign the <a href="Declaration_of_Independence_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Declaration of Independence</a>.</p>
<p>The school has renowned engineering, science, business, education, urban affairs and public policy, <a href="public_administration" title="wikilink">public administration</a>, agriculture, history, <a href="chemical_engineering" title="wikilink">chemical engineering</a>, <a href="chemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemistry</a> and <a href="biochemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">biochemistry</a> programs, among others, drawing from the historically strong presence of the nation's chemical and <a href="pharmaceutical" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmaceutical</a> industries in the state of Delaware. In 2006, UD's engineering program was ranked number 10 in the nation by <a href="The_Princeton_Review" title="wikilink">The Princeton Review</a>. In 2009, <a href="US_News_and_World_Report" title="wikilink">US News and World Report</a>, ranked the chemical engineering program 10th among undergraduate programs and 9th among graduate programs. It is one of only four schools in North America with a major in <a href="Art_conservation_and_restoration" title="wikilink">art conservation</a>. UD was the first American university to begin a study abroad program.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The university is organized into 7 colleges:</p>
<ul>
<li>College of Agriculture and Natural Resources</li>
<li>College of Arts and Sciences</li>
<li>Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics</li>
<li>College of Earth, Ocean and Environment</li>
<li>College of Engineering</li>
<li>College of Health Sciences</li>
<li>College of Education and Public Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of the colleges. Also, on April 3, 2007 the second annual <a href="BusinessWeek" class="uri" title="wikilink">BusinessWeek</a> review of the &quot;Best Undergraduate B-Schools&quot; ranked UD's Lerner College of Business and Economics 29th among the nation's top 58 public university programs and 61st among the 500 schools earning international accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.<a href="http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2007/apr/bschools040307.html">3</a></p>
<p>In recent years, the student body has been labeled as one of the most politically apathetic in the nation. Although there are a number of activist student groups on campus, the University was ranked 4th out of 361 schools in the &quot;Election? What Election?&quot; category in the Princeton Review's 2007 college ratings <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This perception is quickly changing however, and such rankings have not gone unnoticed by university officials. An April 2008 report by the school's Strategic Planning Committee identified student engagement in the &quot;social, cultural, artistic, and scientific challenges of our age&quot; as one of the university's primary long-term goals<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. University students have also responded to the charges of student apathy, and the 2007-2008 academic year saw the creation of a number of student organizations aimed at increasing political dialogue amongst undergraduates <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The 2008 Presidential Election has also brought much attention to the University and has increased student involvement in political activism. In August 2008, the University was hailed as the &quot;epicenter&quot; of the presidential election by <a href="Bloomberg_News" title="wikilink">Bloomberg News</a> <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. <a href="Joe_Biden" title="wikilink">Joe Biden</a> (D), Delaware, who graduated from the University, was elected Vice President of the United States on November 4, 2008 as <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>'s running mate. In addition, Biden's wife, Jill, as well as <a href="David_Plouffe" title="wikilink">David Plouffe</a>, Obama's campaign strategist, and <a href="Steve_Schmidt" title="wikilink">Steve Schmidt</a>, McCain's campaign strategist all graduated from UD. Senator Biden appeared at the University in a campaign rally on October 31, 2008, just days before the election, in front of an estimated crowd of 7,000.</p>

<p><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The student body at the University of Delaware is largely an undergraduate population. The University of Delaware offers over 100 undergraduate degrees, and due to the vast number of academic options many students complete dual degrees as well as double majors and minors. Delaware students have a great deal of access to work and internship opportunities. An easily accessible online database contains over 1,000 internship opportunities available for all majors. The Center hosts 15 major career fairs with over 500 employers in attendance and the Campus Interview Program, which brings over 600 employer representatives to campus. Like other corporate players that call Delaware home, <a href="MBNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">MBNA</a> (now <a href="Bank_of_America" title="wikilink">Bank of America</a>) invests in the UD community through the construction of the new Career Services Center building, the hiring of students, and sponsorship of scholarships. With Delaware's location in <a href="Newark,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Newark, Delaware</a>, students are able to land jobs and internships in Delaware, as well as in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Wilmington,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a>, <a href="Baltimore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>, and <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>. More than 90% of Delaware graduates who do not go directly to graduate school report finding full-time positions within six months of graduating.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, &quot;4+1&quot; Accelerated Programs also allow students to pursue both their bachelor's and master's degrees within a five-year period. Opportunities in the College of Human Services, Education and Public Policy exist to acquire a bachelor's in leadership and a master's in public administration. Students may also pursue a bachelor's degree in hotel management and a master's in business administration through a &quot;4+1+1&quot; program where students work for one year between the undergraduate and graduate experiences. Students in the College of Engineering can pursue a bachelor's degree in one of the University's engineering disciplines and a master's in business administration.</p>
<p>The Medical Scholars Program is an opportunity for academically competitive students who wish to pursue careers in the medical profession. Successful participation in the Medical Scholars Program leads to a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies from the University of Delaware and the M.D. degree from <a href="Thomas_Jefferson_University" title="wikilink">Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The Ronald McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program is an initiative to prepare and empower low-income, first generation college students and underrepresented students (of African American, Latino, and Native American descent) for doctoral study; allowing them to complete a Baccalaureate degree, enroll in graduate school, and ultimately attain a doctoral degree. Since its inception at Delaware, the program boasts a 100% placement rate of its scholars in graduate programs across the country.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Dean's Scholar Program is designed to serve the needs of a highly selective group of students who are motivated and talented and have a clear view of their long-range educational goals. Dean's Scholars are granted flexibility in college requirements so that they can build their entire program with faculty advisers and create original programs of study, including off-campus experiences and independent research. This opportunity is available to outstanding sophomores in the Colleges of Arts and Science, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Health and Nursing Sciences, and Education and Public Policy.</p>

<h3 id="college-of-engineering">College of Engineering</h3>
<p>The University of Delaware College of Engineering traces its beginnings to 1837, when a class in &quot;surveying and leveling&quot; was first taught at Newark College. Civil engineering became part of the science curriculum in 1850, but degree programs were not established until 1889 for Civil Engineering, 1891 for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and 1914 for Chemical Engineering. In the early 1920s, the University of Delaware was known primarily for its engineering school, with more than half of the institution's entire student body enrolled in one of the four engineering disciplines. Long recognized for its emphasis on teaching, the College of Engineering endeavored to establish strong research and graduate programs as well. <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> brought the first significant funding for research, setting a new pattern for the institution. By 1960, Chemical Engineering's graduate education and research initiatives had earned the department national prominence. In the early 1970s, the Mechanical Engineering department became one of the first in the country to teach composite materials, leading to the creation of the internationally recognized Center for Composite Materials <a href="http://www.ccm.udel.edu">4</a>. The new interdisciplinary research center created a unique model for industry cooperation and led the College to establish eight more research centers over the next 30 years. Materials Science, founded in 1960 as a program, was established as the College's fifth department in 1998. Today, the College of Engineering continues a proud tradition of excellence in research, teaching and service that has brought prestigious national accolades to both faculty and students.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The University of Delaware traces its founding to 1743, when Presbyterian minister <a href="Francis_Alison" title="wikilink">Francis Alison</a> opened up his &quot;Free School&quot; in his home in <a href="New_London,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">New London, Pennsylvania</a>. The school changed its name and location several times, ending up as the Academy of Newark in 1769 (chartered by the colonial government). Since Delaware was part of the Pennsylvania colony until 1776, the academy was denied charter as a college in order to prevent its competing with the <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a> (then known as the <strong>College of Philadelphia</strong>). In 1833, the General assembly for the State of Delaware passed the &quot;An Act to Establish a College at Newark&quot;, and the next year, Newark College opened. It changed its name in 1843 to Delaware College and it merged with the Academy of Newark. The school closed from 1859 until 1870 (Newark Academy separated from the college in 1869). On March 28, 1921, by another act of state assembly, it merged with the nearby Delaware Women's college (founded in 1913) to form the University.</p>
<p>On October 23, 2009 the University of Delaware signed an agreement with <a href="Chrysler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> to purchase a 272-acre closed vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the University for expansion for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring plan.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>The University recently implemented a system named UD Alert, to alert students and faculty of emergencies on campus by sending text, voice, and e-mail messages to the individuals <a href="http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/sep/update090807.html">7</a>. The University was also one of the original campuses in the country to implement the &quot;blue light&quot; emergency phone system in the late 1980s.</p>
<h4 id="residence-life-controversy">Residence Life controversy</h4>
<p>In October 2007, the Office of Residence Life's diversity program was criticized by several students, and faculty as well as the <a href="Foundation_for_Individual_Rights_in_Education" title="wikilink">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE) for infringing on students rights. FIRE argued that residence hall programs, one on ones and floor meetings administered through <a href="resident_assistant" title="wikilink">resident assistants</a> forced students into accepting &quot;university-approved ideologies.&quot; FIRE specifically criticized programs dealing with issues of <a href="sexual_identity" title="wikilink">sexual identity</a>, <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">race</a>, and <a href="sustainability" class="uri" title="wikilink">sustainability</a>.<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/thefirecache/8555.html?PHPSESSID=de4a52a600d045acb9b6ab5daf011fd9">8</a><a href="http://cbs3.com/delawarewire/22.0.html?type=nplocal&amp;state=DE&amp;category=News&amp;filename=DE--University-Ideolo.xml">9</a> The controversy originated from training programs given to resident assistants that suggested all white people were inherently <a href="racist" class="uri" title="wikilink">racist</a>, and because minorities were not in the majority, they could not be racist. The program was suspended on November 1, 2007, with university president Patrick T. Harker quoted as saying, &quot;There are questions about its practices that must be addressed and there are reasons for concern that the actual purpose is not being fulfilled.&quot;<a href="http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/daily/2007/11/586n.htm">10</a> In May 2008, against some student protest, the University reinstated an amended version of the previous program. <a href="http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/may/senate051208.html">11</a> The <a href="National_Association_of_Scholars" title="wikilink">National Association of Scholars</a>(NAS), an <a href="education_reform" title="wikilink">education reform</a> group, and an early critic of the Residence Life program, called the amended version a repackaging of the original program.

<p>The recent history of the university has been marked by massive construction projects. North or Laird Campus, formerly home to the Pencader Complex, has been entirely redesigned and renamed Independence Complex. This began with the construction of a Marriott Courtyard run by the HRIM (Hotel Restaurant and Institutional Management) department. Three new residence hall buildings have also been built and named after the three University Alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence, <a href="George_Read_(signer)" title="wikilink">George Read</a>, <a href="Thomas_McKean" title="wikilink">Thomas McKean</a> and <a href="James_Smith_(political_figure)" title="wikilink">James Smith</a> (who signed for Pennsylvania). The third Delaware signer, <a href="Caesar_Rodney" title="wikilink">Caesar Rodney</a>, already had a dorm complex named after him on West Campus. A fourth residence hall opened for the Fall of 2008, named Independence Hall; the building is split into East and West wings.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>New academic buildings have also been constructed recently. In 2006, the Center For The Arts had its grand opening, with new facilities for the school's music and theater programs.

<h2 id="alcohol-abuse">Alcohol abuse</h2>
<p>A campus website claims that a 1993 study by the <a href="Harvard_School_of_Public_Health" title="wikilink">Harvard School of Public Health</a> found that high-risk drinking at UD exceeded the national norm. On this survey, a majority of students reported binge drinking more than once in a two-week interval. The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month. Ironically, UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations. Of these, 120 led to arrests. These figures are up from previous years, 1062 in 2004 and 1026 in 2003.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This represents approximately 6% of the student population.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Caution must be used in interpreting these figures; a higher number of reported violations may represent more enforcement, not necessarily more actual violations.</p>
<p>UD has expended considerable effort and financial resources to reduce the drinking problem on campus; in 1991 UD founded the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies. One of the center's major initiatives is a collaborative plan to reduce irresponsible drinking at UD, called &quot;A Matter of Degree&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Beginning in the fall of 2006, incoming freshman had to complete an online course, AlcoholEdu.</p>
<p>At least one student organization has undertaken the goal of &quot;providing fun activities for those who chose not to drink&quot; and to &quot;promote the idea that one doesn't need alcohol to have a good time.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 2008, an 18 year old Freshman, Brett Griffin, died of alcohol poisoning at an off campus fraternity party. Griffin was pledging the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, and was encouraged to drink an entire bottle of &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; before being assigned a fraternity brother.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Six UD students have been arrested and charged, and the Griffin family is currently suing the fraternity.</p>
