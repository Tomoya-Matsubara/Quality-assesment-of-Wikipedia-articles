<p><strong>Margie Velma Barfield</strong> (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e <strong>Margie Velma Bullard</strong>) (October 29, 1932 â€“ November 2, 1984) was an <a href="Americans" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="serial_killer" title="wikilink">serial killer</a>, convicted of six <a href="murder" title="wikilink">murders</a>. She was the first woman in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> to be executed after the 1976 <a href="Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States#Capital_punishment_resumed" title="wikilink">resumption of capital punishment</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the first since 1962.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She was also the first woman to be executed by <a href="lethal_injection" title="wikilink">lethal injection</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Velma Barfield was born in rural <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>, but grew up near <a href="Fayetteville,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Fayetteville, North Carolina</a>. Her father reportedly was abusive and she resented her mother who did not stop the beatings.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> She escaped by marrying Thomas Burke in 1949.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The couple had two children and were reportedly happy until Barfield had a <a href="hysterectomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">hysterectomy</a> and developed back pain.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These events led to a behavioral change in Barfield and an eventual drug addiction.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Thomas Burke began to drink and Barfield's complaints turned into bitter arguments.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On April 4, 1969, after Burke had passed out, Barfield and the children left the house, returning to find the home burned and Burke dead.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Only a few months later, her home burned once again, this time with a reward of <a href="insurance" class="uri" title="wikilink">insurance</a> money.</p>
<p>In 1970, Barfield married a widower, Jennings Barfield. Less than a year after their marriage, Jennings died on March 22 1971 from <a href="heart" class="uri" title="wikilink">heart</a> complications, leaving Velma a <a href="widow" class="uri" title="wikilink">widow</a> once again.</p>
<p>In 1974, Barfield's mother, Lillian Bullard, showed symptoms of intense <a href="diarrhea" class="uri" title="wikilink">diarrhea</a>, <a href="vomiting" class="uri" title="wikilink">vomiting</a> and <a href="nausea" class="uri" title="wikilink">nausea</a>, only to fully recover a few days later. During the Christmas season of the same year, Lillian experienced the same illness as earlier that year, resulting in her death only hours after arriving at the hospital on December 30, 1974.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1976, Barfield began caring for the elderly, working for Montgomery and Dollie Edwards. Montgomery fell ill and died on January 29, 1977. A little over a month after the death of her husband, Dollie experienced identical symptoms to that of Velma's mother and she too died (March 1, 1977), a death to which Barfield later confessed.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The following year, 1977, Barfield took another caretaking job, this time for 76-year old Record Lee, who had broken her leg. On June 4, 1977, Lee's husband, John Henry, began experiencing racking pains in his stomach and chest along with vomiting and diarrhea. He died soon afterward and Barfield later confessed to his murder.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Another victim was Rowland Stuart Taylor, Barfield's boyfriend and a relative of Dollie Edwards.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Fearing he had discovered she had been forging checks on his account, she mixed an <a href="arsenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">arsenic</a>-based rat poison into his beer and tea.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He died on February 3, 1978, while she was trying to &quot;nurse&quot; him back to health; an autopsy found arsenic in Taylor's system.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> After her arrest, the body of Jennings Barfield was exhumed and found to have traces of arsenic, a murder that Barfield denied having committed.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Although she subsequently confessed to the murders of Lillian Bullard, Dollie Edwards, and John Henry Lee,she was tried and convicted only for the murder of Taylor.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Singer-songwriter <a href="Jonathan_Byrd_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jonathan Byrd</a> is the grandson of Jennings Barfield and his first wife. Byrd's song &quot;Velma&quot; from his <em><a href="Wildflowers_(Jonathan_Byrd_album)" title="wikilink">Wildflowers</a></em> album gives a personal account of the murders and investigation.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prison-and-execution">Prison and execution</h2>
<p>During her stay on death row, Barfield became a devout born again Christian.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> While she had been a devout churchgoer all of her life and had often attended revivals held by <a href="Rex_Humbard" title="wikilink">Rex Humbard</a> and other evangelists, she later said she'd only been playing at being a Christian.</p>
<p>Her last few years were spent ministering to prisoners, for which she received praise from <a href="Billy_Graham" title="wikilink">Billy Graham</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Barfield's involvement in Christian ministry was extensive to the point that an effort was made to obtain a commutation to life imprisonment.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After a Federal court appeal was denied, Barfield instructed her attorneys to abandon plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Barfield was executed on November 2, 1984<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> at Central Prison in <a href="Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Raleigh</a>, <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> She released a statement before the execution, stating &quot;I know that everybody has gone through a lot of pain, all the families connected, and I am sorry, and I want to thank everybody who have been supporting me all these six years.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Barfield declined a <a href="last_meal" title="wikilink">last meal</a>, having instead a bag of <a href="Cheez_Doodles" title="wikilink">Cheez Doodles</a> and a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Barfield wore pink pajamas and an adult diaper as she was put to death.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Barfield's execution raised some political controversies when <a href="Governor_of_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Jim_Hunt" title="wikilink">Jim Hunt</a>, who faced a bout with incumbent <a href="Jesse_Helms" title="wikilink">Jesse Helms</a> for his <a href="US_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> seat (which Hunt lost), rejected Barfield's request for clemency.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Barfield was buried in a small rural North Carolina cemetery, near her first husband, Thomas Burke.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
