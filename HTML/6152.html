<p>Davis's work ranges from representational <a href="post-impressionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-impressionism</a> to highly abstract <a href="expressionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">expressionism</a>. Much of Davis's art is influenced by the <a href="cubism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cubism</a> of <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a>, who he has claimed to have studied under and worked with in Europe. His other major influence is Diego Rivera and the other Mexican muralists. Davis assisted Diego Rivera on the <em>Detroit Industry</em> mural panels in Rivera Court in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Davis says that he painted a &quot;<a href="Dick_Tracey" title="wikilink">Dick Tracey</a>&quot; like face on one of the figures when Rivera asked for a tough looking figure.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He also assisted Rivera on a mural painted inside the Ford Motor Company's <a href="River_Rouge_Plant" title="wikilink">Rouge Plant</a>, in <a href="Dearborn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dearborn</a>, Michigan.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> One of Davis's paintings is displayed in the <a href="Louvre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvre</a>.

He has painted commissioned portraits of celebrities including <a href="Katharine_Hepburn" title="wikilink">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a>. Davis is also known for his community mural projects in which he works with young people to produce large scale co-operatively produced paintings. At least two of these murals can be found in Southwest Detroit.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Davis has been a long time member of Detroit's <a href="Scarab_Club" title="wikilink">Scarab Club</a> a gallery and social venue for leading Detroit artists. His autograph is founds on the club's ceiling beam along with the autographs of Diego Rivera, <a href="Norman_Rockwell" title="wikilink">Norman Rockwell</a> and <a href="John_Sloan" title="wikilink">John Sloan</a>.

<h2 id="community-activism">Community activism</h2>
<p>Davis resides in Southwest Detroit, the heart of the city's <a href="barrio" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrio</a> and the home to many enclave neighborhood of great cultural and ethnic diversity. Since the 1980s Davis has been active in an ecumenical project seeking to unite this community around the development of senior housing and services for children, first through the community based group Ecumenical Project SAVE and later Bridging Communities Inc. This activism has resulted in an 80 unit senior affordable housing project known as the &quot;Pablo Davis Senior Center.&quot; This project also incorporates intergenerational programs to enhance services for both seniors and children. Davis, who has donated much of his portfolio and collection to this project, resides and maintains a studio in this complex. Although still an avowed communist and revolutionary, Davis asserts he is comfortable working with this mostly religious and <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> group.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
