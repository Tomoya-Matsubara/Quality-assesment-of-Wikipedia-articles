In the episode, <a href="Eric_Cartman" title="wikilink">Cartman</a> misinterprets news reports about <a href="Piracy_in_Somalia" title="wikilink">Piracy in Somalia</a> to mean the return of the <a href="Golden_Age_of_Piracy" title="wikilink">classic era</a> of swashbuckling <a href="Piracy" title="wikilink">pirates</a>, and misleads a handful of South Park boys to voyage to <a href="Mogadishu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mogadishu</a> to start a pirate crew.</p>
<p>The episode was written and directed by series co-founder <a href="Trey_Parker" title="wikilink">Trey Parker</a>, and was rated <a href="Television_content_rating_systems" title="wikilink">TV-MA L</a> in the United States for strong to extreme language. &quot;Fatbeard&quot; was a reference to increasing international media attention to Somalian piracy, and the script depicted the pirates in a sympathetic light. The crew of the <a href="USS_Bainbridge_(DDG-96)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Bainbridge</em></a>, the <a href="Arleigh_Burke_class_destroyer" title="wikilink"><em>Arleigh Burke</em>-class</a> <a href="Destroyer" title="wikilink">guided missile destroyer</a> which participated in the rescue of the <a href="Maersk_Alabama_hijacking" title="wikilink">hijacked</a> <a href="Merchant_vessel" title="wikilink">MV</a> <em><a href="MV_Maersk_Alabama" title="wikilink">Maersk Alabama</a></em>, contacted the <em>South Park</em> creators to praise them for the episode. &quot;Fatbeard&quot; received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2.59 million households in its original broadcast, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production the week it aired.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Having misunderstood the news about a recent upsurge of <a href="piracy_in_Somalia" title="wikilink">piracy in Somalia</a>, <a href="Eric_Cartman" title="wikilink">Cartman</a> excitedly tells his friends the <a href="Golden_Age_of_Piracy" title="wikilink">classic era</a> of <a href="piracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">piracy</a> has returned, and asks the boys to join him in becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, <a href="Kyle_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Kyle</a> encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although <a href="Butters_Stotch" title="wikilink">Butters</a>, <a href="Ike_Broflovski" title="wikilink">Ike</a>, <a href="List_of_students_at_South_Park_Elementary#Clyde_Donovan" title="wikilink">Clyde</a> and <a href="List_of_students_at_South_Park_Elementary#Kevin_Stoley" title="wikilink">Kevin</a> are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to <a href="Cairo,_Egypt" title="wikilink">Cairo, Egypt</a>. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in <a href="Mogadishu" title="wikilink">Mogadishu, Somalia</a> dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in an impoverished <a href="failed_state" title="wikilink">failed state</a> and <a href="anarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchy</a>, completely opposite their expectations.</p>
<p>They quickly find the pirates, who are shocked that anyone would knowingly venture into their lair. The pirates decide to ransom the boys to the first European vessel they find. The boys confidently go with them, believing they are being taken to a pirate ship, but are once again disappointed when they are taken to a small motorboat. Eventually, the pirates find a French <a href="schooner" class="uri" title="wikilink">schooner</a> and demand a ransom of five thousand <a href="euro" title="wikilink">euros</a> in exchange for the lives of the boys. Meanwhile in South Park, Kyle happily claims partial credit for sending Cartman to Somalia and expects things will be better without Cartman around. But when his parents read him a farewell letter from Ike, Kyle realizes his brother has run off with Cartman to Somalia, and he sets off for Mogadishu to bring his brother home. Back in Somalia, the ransom is paid and the boys are surrendered. Once on board, however, Cartman assumes control of the <a href="schooner" class="uri" title="wikilink">schooner</a> and orders the crew to get onto the <a href="Lifeboat_(shipboard)" title="wikilink">lifeboat</a>. Although the captain initially refuses, Kevin brandishes a toy <a href="lightsaber" class="uri" title="wikilink">lightsaber</a>, frightening the French crew into abandoning ship. Cartman and the boys return to Mogadishu with the captured vessel, giving several bundles of euros to the pirates, who are initially shocked, but begin to respect Cartman, who, unimpressed by their lack of traditional &quot;pirate&quot; traits, in turn leads them in raiding ships, and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical crew, leading them a traditional <a href="sea_shanty" title="wikilink">sea shanty</a> called &quot;Somalian Pirates, We&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the French crew is discovered by a cargo ship, and the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> is deployed by <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> due to the news that the pirates now have advanced weaponry (meaning the lightsaber, which was reported to be real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When they say that they left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being hollered at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them going to school was his ultimate dream, but he was forced to become a pirate because he was desperately poor and his family would otherwise die. Butters and Ike, realizing how irresponsible they all have been, admit that a life of piracy is one of suffering and hardship, not fun and adventure, and tell Cartman they want to return home. Cartman, however, refuses to give up his romantic delusions and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted, however, when a U.S Navy ship appears off the coast carrying snipers, who kill all of Cartman's pirates with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.</p>

Carlos Delgado of <em>If</em> magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending &quot;perfect&quot;. Delgado said of the show's creators, &quot;These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk. And because <em>South Park</em> can be made in like a week&lt;U+2014&gt;and I&lt;U+2019&gt;m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product&lt;U+2014&gt;they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Ken Tucker of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Sean O'Neal of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V.

Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel and the extent to which Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot &quot;isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
