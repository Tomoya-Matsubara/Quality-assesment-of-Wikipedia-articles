<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Apollo, originally referred to as Apollo Advisors, was founded in 1990, on the heels of the collapse of <a href="Drexel_Burnham_Lambert" title="wikilink">Drexel Burnham Lambert</a> in February 1990. It was founded by <a href="Leon_Black" title="wikilink">Leon Black</a>, the former head of Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, along with other Drexel alumni.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Among the most notable founders are John Hannan, Drexel's former co-director of international finance; Craig Cogut, a lawyer who worked with Drexel's high-yield division in Los Angeles; and Arthur Bilger, the former head of the corporate finance department. Other founding partners included Marc Rowan and Michael Gross, who both worked under Black in the mergers and acquisitions department and Tony Ressler, who worked as a senior vice president in Drexel's high yield department with responsibilities for the responsibility for the new issue/syndicate desk.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Less than six months after the collapse of Drexel, the founders of Apollo had already begun a series of ventures. Apollo Investment Fund L.P., the first of their private equity investment funds was formed to make investments in distressed companies. Apollo's first fund raised approximately $400 million of investor commitments on the strength of Black's reputation as a prominent lieutenant of <a href="Michael_Milken" title="wikilink">Michael Milken</a> and key player in the <a href="private_equity_in_the_1980s" title="wikilink">buyout boom of the 1980s</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Lion Advisors was set up to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais, which was seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high yield market.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="s">1990s</h3>
<p>At that time of Apollo's founding, financing for new leveraged buyouts was minimal and Apollo turned instead to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Apollo would purchase <a href="distressed_securities" title="wikilink">distressed securities</a> which could be converted into a controlling interest in the equity of the company through a bankruptcy reorganization or other restructuring. Apollo used distressed debt as an entry point, enabling the firm to invest in such firms as <a href="Vail_Resorts" title="wikilink">Vail Resorts</a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, <a href="Walter_Industries" title="wikilink">Walter Industries</a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, <a href="Culligan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Culligan</a> and <a href="Samsonite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samsonite</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Early on, Apollo made a name for itself by acquiring interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing <a href="high-yield_bond" title="wikilink">high-yield bonds</a> from failed <a href="savings_and_loan" title="wikilink">savings and loans</a> and insurance companies. Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government's <a href="Resolution_Trust_Corporation" title="wikilink">Resolution Trust Corporation</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. Using this vehicle, Apollo would purchase the Executive Life portfolio, generating tremendous profits when the value of high yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> More than a decade after the purchase, in 2002, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer accused Apollo, Leon Black, and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais, of illegally acquiring the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991. According to the State of California, Lion allegedly violated a California law that prohibited foreign government-owned banks from owning California insurance companies.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1995, Apollo raised its third private equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund III with $1.5 billion of investor commitments from investors that included <a href="CalPERS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CalPERS</a> and the <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors pension fund</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Unlike its first two funds and later funds, Fund III would ultimately prove only an average performer for private equity funds of its vintage. Among the investments made in Fund III (invested through 1998) were: Alliance Imaging, <a href="Allied_Waste_Industries" title="wikilink">Allied Waste Industries</a>, <a href="Breuner_Home_Furnishings" title="wikilink">Breuner Home Furnishings</a>, <a href="Levitz_Furniture" title="wikilink">Levitz Furniture</a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, <a href="Communications_Corporation_of_America" title="wikilink">Communications Corporation of America</a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>, <a href="Dominick&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dominick's</a>, <a href="Ralphs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ralphs</a> (acquired Apollo's <a href="Food-4-Less" class="uri" title="wikilink">Food-4-Less</a>)<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>, <a href="Move.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Move.com</a>, <a href="NRT_Incorporated" title="wikilink">NRT Incorporated</a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>, <a href="Pillowtex_Corporation" title="wikilink">Pillowtex Corporation</a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>, <a href="Telemundo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Telemundo</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and <a href="WMC_Mortgage_Corporation" title="wikilink">WMC Mortgage Corporation</a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>.</p>

Since inception Pegasus has raised $1.8 billion in four private equity funds focused on investments in <a href="middle-market_company" title="wikilink">middle-market companies</a> in financial distress. In 1997, Apollo co-founder Tony Ressler founded <a href="Ares_Management" title="wikilink">Ares Management</a> as the successor to its Lion Advisors business which would manage <a href="collateralized_debt_obligation" title="wikilink">collateralized debt obligation</a> vehicles.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1998, Apollo raised its fourth private equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund IV, with $3.6 billion of investor commitments.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Among the investments made in Fund IV (invested through 2001) were: <a href="Allied_Waste_Industries" title="wikilink">Allied Waste Industries</a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a>, <a href="AMC_Entertainment" title="wikilink">AMC Entertainment</a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>, <a href="Berlitz_International" title="wikilink">Berlitz International</a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a>, Clark Retail Enterprises<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>, <a href="Corporate_Express" title="wikilink">Corporate Express</a> (<a href="Buhrmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buhrmann</a>) , Encompass Services Corporation, National Financial Partners, <a href="Pacer_International" title="wikilink">Pacer International</a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>, <a href="Rent-A-Center" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rent-A-Center</a>, <a href="Resolution_Performance_Products" title="wikilink">Resolution Performance Products</a>, <a href="Resolution_Specialty_Materials" title="wikilink">Resolution Specialty Materials</a>, <a href="Sirius_Satellite_Radio" title="wikilink">Sirius Satellite Radio</a>, SkyTerra Communications, <a href="United_Rentals" title="wikilink">United Rentals</a> and <a href="Wyndham_Worldwide" title="wikilink">Wyndham Worldwide</a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>.</p>

Amid the turmoil of collapsing markets, Apollo was able to raise its fifth private equity fund in 2001, Apollo Investment Fund V, with $3.7 billion of investor commitments, roughly the same amount raised as for its previous fund.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Among the investments made in Fund V (invested through 2006) were <a href="Affinion_Group" title="wikilink">Affinion Group</a>, <a href="AMC_Entertainment" title="wikilink">AMC Entertainment</a>, <a href="Berry_Plastics" title="wikilink">Berry Plastics</a>, <a href="Cablecom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cablecom</a>, <a href="Compass_Minerals" title="wikilink">Compass Minerals</a>, <a href="General_Nutrition_Centers" title="wikilink">General Nutrition Centers</a> (GNC), Goodman Global, <a href="Hexion_Specialty_Chemicals" title="wikilink">Hexion Specialty Chemicals</a> (<a href="Borden_(company)" title="wikilink">Borden</a>), <a href="Intelsat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Intelsat</a>, <a href="Linens_&lt;U+2018&gt;n_Things" title="wikilink">Linens &lt;U+2018&gt;n Things</a>, Metals USA, <a href="Nalco_Investment_Holdings" title="wikilink">Nalco Investment Holdings</a>, Sourcecorp, <a href="Spectrasite_Communications" title="wikilink">Spectrasite Communications</a>, Unity Media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ares continued to grow through the late 1990s, and profited significantly from investments made after the collapse of the high yield market in 2000 and 2001. Although technically, the founders of Ares had completed a <a href="spin_out" title="wikilink">spin out</a> with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo. By 2002, when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund, the firm announced that it was more formally separating itself from its former parent company.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The timing of this separation also coincided with Apollo's legal difficulties with the State of California over its purchase of <a href="Executive_Life_Insurance_Company" title="wikilink">Executive Life Insurance Company</a> in 1991.</p>
<p>Following the spin-off of Ares in 2002, Apollo developed two new affiliates to continue its investment activities in the capital markets. The first of these new affiliates, founded in 2003, was Apollo Distressed Investment Fund (DIF) Management a credit opportunity investment vehicle.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The following year, in April 2004, Apollo raised $930 million through an <a href="initial_public_offering" title="wikilink">initial public offering</a> (IPO) for a listed <a href="business_development_company" title="wikilink">business development company</a>, Apollo Investment Corporation ()).

<p>In August 2006, Apollo launched a $2 billion <a href="publicly_traded_private_equity" title="wikilink">publicly traded private equity</a> vehicle in Europe, AP Alternative Assets (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAA.AS">ENXTAM:AAA</a>).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The IPO of this new vehicle followed in the footsteps of <a href="Kohlberg_Kravis_Roberts" title="wikilink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</a>, which raised $5 billion for its KKR Private Equity Investors vehicle in May 2006.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Apollo initially attempted to raise $2.5 billion for the public vehicle, but fell short when it offered the shares in June, raising only $1.5 billion.

<p>As the private equity industry expanded through 2006 and 2007, several of the largest private equity firms, most notably <a href="The_Blackstone_Group" title="wikilink">The Blackstone Group</a> and <a href="Kohlberg_Kravis_Roberts" title="wikilink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</a>, announced plans to realize value from their firms through the sale of shares in the public equity markets. Apollo Management chose a slightly different path, by completing a <a href="private_placement" title="wikilink">private placement</a> of shares in its management company in July 2007. By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo would be able to avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In November 2007, Apollo was able to realize additional value from the sale of a 9% ownership interest in its management company to the <a href="Abu_Dhabi_Investment_Authority" title="wikilink">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</a> (ADIA).<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Ultimately, in April 2008, Apollo would file with the <a href="U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="wikilink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC)<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> to permit some holders of its privately traded stock to sell their shares on the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In 2008, the firm opened an office in India, marking their first push into Asia.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="affiliated-businesses">Affiliated businesses</h2>
<p>From its inception, Apollo built as part of a network of affiliated businesses focusing on <a href="private_equity" title="wikilink">private equity</a> and a variety of <a href="distressed_securities" title="wikilink">distressed</a> investment strategies.</p>
<h3 id="lion-advisors">Lion Advisors</h3>
<p>Lion Advisors (or Lion Capital), which was founded at the same time as Apollo in 1990, focused on investment management and consulting services to foreign institutional accounts targeting investments in public and private high yield debt securities in the US. In 1992, Lion entered into a more formal arrangement to manage the $3 billion high-yield portfolio for Credit Lyonnais which together with a consortium of other international investors provided the capital for Lion's investment activities. The Lion business would ultimately be replaced by Ares Management.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ares-management">Ares Management</h3>

<p>Ares Management, founded in 1997, was established initially was formed to manage a $1.2 billion <a href="Collateralized_debt_obligation#Structures" title="wikilink">market value collateralized debt obligation vehicle</a>. Ares would grow to manage a family of <a href="collateralized_loan_obligation" title="wikilink">collateralized loan obligation</a> (CLO) vehicles that would invest in capital markets-based securities including senior bank loans and high-yield and mezzanine debt. Ares was founded by Anthony Ressler and John H. Kissick, both partners at Apollo as well as Bennett Rosenthal, who joined the group from the global leveraged finance group at <a href="Merrill_Lynch" title="wikilink">Merrill Lynch</a>.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Ares I and II which were raised were structured as <a href="Collateralized_debt_obligation#Structures" title="wikilink">market value CLOs</a>. Ares III though Ares X were structured as <a href="Collateralized_debt_obligation#Structures" title="wikilink">cash flow CLOs</a>. In 2002, Ares completed a spinout from Apollo management. Although technically, the founders of Ares had completed a spinout with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo. Shortly thereafter, Ares completed fundraising for Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, a special situations investment fund with $750 million of capital under management.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="area-property-partners-apollo-real-estate-advisors">AREA Property Partners (Apollo Real Estate Advisors)</h3>

<p>AREA Property Partners, originally Apollo Real Estate, was founded in 1993 by William Mack, to take advantage of opportunities to purchase distressed properties as many real estate markets crashed in the early 1990s.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund, L.P., the first in a family of real estate &lt;U+201C&gt;opportunity funds&lt;U+201D&gt; was closed in April 1993 with $500 million of investor commitments. As of 2008, the firm was investing out of three funds: Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund V, Apollo European Real Estate Fund II and Apollo Value Enhancement Fund VII. In 2004, Apollo Real Estate acquired the Value Enhancement Funds family of investment vehicles to broaden its offerings in the &lt;U+201C&gt;value-added&lt;U+201D&gt; segment of the real estate investment spectrum. Apollo also operates a real estate mezzanine lending program.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
