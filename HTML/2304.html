<p><strong>Eccles</strong> (pop. 36,600) is a town in the <a href="City_of_Salford" title="wikilink">City of Salford</a>, a <a href="metropolitan_borough" title="wikilink">metropolitan borough</a> of <a href="Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Greater Manchester</a> in <a href="North_West_England" title="wikilink">North West England</a>,  west of <a href="Salford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salford</a> and  west of <a href="Manchester_city_centre" title="wikilink">Manchester city centre</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Historic_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">Historically</a> a part of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, Eccles lies on sloping ground between the <a href="M602_motorway" title="wikilink">M602 motorway</a> (to the north), and the <a href="Manchester_Ship_Canal" title="wikilink">Manchester Ship Canal</a> (to the south).</p>
<p>Evidence of pre-historic human settlement has been discovered locally, but the present town grew up around the 13th-century <a href="Church_of_St_Mary_the_Virgin,_Eccles" title="wikilink">Parish Church of St Mary</a>. The area was predominantly agricultural until the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>, when a textile industry was established in the town. The arrival of the <a href="Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" title="wikilink">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, the world's first passenger railway, led to the town's expansion along the route of the track linking those two cities; as of 2009 Salford City Council is bidding for the railway to be included in the <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a> list of <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Sites</a>. Eccles was not immune to the general 20th-century decline of the United Kingdom's textile industry. Parts of the town are among the worst 20% in the UK for child poverty, and the unemployment rate is slightly above the national average. The town's present-day landscape is dominated by residential tower blocks, forming a stark contrast with the surrounding <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> terraced housing.</p>
<p><a href="Eccles_Cake" title="wikilink">Eccles Cakes</a>, made from flaky pastry, butter, nutmeg, candied peel, sugar and currants, were first produced and sold in the town in 1793, and are now exported across the world. Eccles' other claim to fame is its involvement in one of the world's first railway accidents when in 1830 <a href="William_Huskisson" title="wikilink">William Huskisson</a>, the <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> for Liverpool, was seriously injured by an approaching <a href="locomotive" class="uri" title="wikilink">locomotive</a>. He was taken to the vicarage in Eccles for treatment, but died of his injuries.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="toponymy">Toponymy</h3>
<p>No definitive proof of the derivation of the name survives, but several theories exist to explain the modern name &quot;Eccles&quot;. One is that the eccles place&lt;U+2013&gt;name is derived from the <a href="Romano-British" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romano-British</a> &quot;Ecles&quot; or &quot;Eglys&quot;, itself derived from the Latin &quot;<a href="Ecclesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ecclesia</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Following the arrival in AD 613 of the invading <a href="Anglo-Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxons</a> at Lancashire, many existing British place&lt;U+2013&gt;names, especially rivers and hills (the <a href="River_Irwell" title="wikilink">River Irwell</a> for example), survived intact. The root &quot;Ecles&quot;, found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape. Eccles appears to have been such a village, and &quot;Ecles&quot; may be the likely source of the modern name.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In Kenyon's <em>&quot;Origins of Lancashire&quot;</em> (1991) however the author suggests that this may not be the case as there is not an exact correlation between eccles place&lt;U+2013&gt;names and pre-<em><a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday</a></em> <a href="Hundred_(country_subdivision)" title="wikilink">hundreds</a> in south Lancashire.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The derivation of the name of the area therefore remains unclear.</p>

<p>Pre-historic finds in the parish of Eccles include <a href="Dugout_(boat)" title="wikilink">dugout boats</a> found at <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barton-upon-Irwell</a>, an individual example of an <a href="Arrowhead_(stone_age)" title="wikilink">arrowhead</a>, a <a href="spear" class="uri" title="wikilink">spear</a>, and <a href="axe" title="wikilink">axes</a> at Winton. These finds would appear to suggest the existence of a hunting and travelling society. Human existence in the area may extend as far back as 6000 BC, and there may have been two separate periods of settlement on <a href="Chat_Moss" title="wikilink">Chat Moss</a>, around 500 BC and also during the <a href="Romano-British" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romano-British</a> period.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The village may have been founded by refugees from Manchester (<em><a href="Mamucium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mamucium</a></em>) during the <a href="Diocletianic_Persecution" title="wikilink">Diocletianic Persecution</a> in the early 4th century,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> although excavations in 2001&lt;U+2013&gt;2005 revealed that the civilian settlement at Manchester had probably been abandoned by the mid-3rd century.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Throughout the <a href="Dark_Ages" title="wikilink">Dark Ages</a> the parish appears to have been remote enough to be untouched by any local conflicts, while absorbing successive waves of immigrants from nearby towns.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Manorialism" title="wikilink">Manor</a> of Barton-upon-Irwell once covered a large area; in 1276 it included townships such as Asphull, Halghton, Halliwelle, Farnword, Eccles, Workedele, Withington (latterly Winton), Irwelham, Hulm, Quicklewicke, Suynhul, and Swinton. Before this date it would appear to have been even larger, but by 1320 the manor boundaries were described as &quot;Tordhale Siche descending to Caldebroc, then to the pit near Preste Platteforde and then to another pit, then to the ditch of Roger the Clerk, then to the hedge of Richard the Rimeur, then following the hedge to Caldebroc.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The manor was originally controlled by the Barton family until about 1292 when by marriage it came into the ownership of the Booth family, who retained it for almost 300 years. In 1586 the Trafford family assumed control of the manor, and established themselves in 1632 at Whittleswick, which was renamed <a href="Trafford_Park" title="wikilink">Trafford Park</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The parish of Eccles contained the townships of Barton-upon-Irwell, Clifton, Pendlebury, Pendleton, and Worsley.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Toward the end of the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> the parish had an estimated population of about 4,000 <a href="Eucharist" title="wikilink">Communicants</a>. Agriculture remained an important local industry, with little change from the <a href="Medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medieval</a> system due to a lack of adequate drainage and fertiliser.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> No evidence exists to demonstrate the layout of the area, but it would likely have been the same as the surrounding areas of Salford, <a href="Urmston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urmston</a> and <a href="Warrington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warrington</a> where <a href="oats" class="uri" title="wikilink">oats</a> and <a href="barley" class="uri" title="wikilink">barley</a> would have been grown.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Local <a href="Cottage_industry#Cottage_industry" title="wikilink">cottage industries</a> included <a href="blacksmith" title="wikilink">blacksmiths</a>, <a href="butcher" title="wikilink">butchers</a>, <a href="thatching" class="uri" title="wikilink">thatching</a>, <a href="basket_weaving" title="wikilink">basket weaving</a>, <a href="skinning" class="uri" title="wikilink">skinning</a>, and <a href="tanning" class="uri" title="wikilink">tanning</a>. <a href="Weaving" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weaving</a> was popular, using linen and wool. <a href="Merchant" title="wikilink">Merchants</a> traded in corn, and <a href="Badger_(person)" title="wikilink">badgers</a> bought and sold local produce.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="James_nasmyth.jpg" title="fig:A calotype of James Nasmyth, pictured c. 1844" alt="A calotype of James Nasmyth, pictured c. 1844" /> In 1795 <a href="John_Aikin" title="wikilink">John Aikin</a> described the area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The agriculture of the parish is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, has been a very great hindrance to it. The use of lime&lt;U+2014&gt;imported from Wales, and brought by the inland navigations to the neighbourhood of our collieries&lt;U+2014&gt;has become very general in the improvement of the meadow and pasture lands.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the 18th century the predominance of <a href="Textiles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Textiles</a> in the region is partly demonstrated in the <a href="parish_registers" title="wikilink">parish registers</a> of 1807, which show that 46 children were baptised with 34 fathers employed as <a href="weaver" title="wikilink">weavers</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In <em>Memoirs of seventy years of an eventful life</em> (1852) Charles Hulbert wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principal employment of the working population of Eccles and vicinity at that time, was the manufacture of Cotton Goods on the home or domestic plan. These were not then, according to my present recollection, more than two Spinning Manufactories in Manchester, Arkwright's with its loft chimney, and Douglas's extensive Works, on the river Irwell, near the Broken bank ... At the period of my first residence in Eccles Parish, I believe the above Mills chiefly supplied the Weavers of Eccles and other parishes with twist for warps, which were purchased by the Master Manufacturers.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

The Liverpool and Manchester Railway can be seen to the south of the building as it crosses the Bridgewater Canal." /> During the early 19th century the growth of industry meant the majority of the area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The <a href="factory_system" title="wikilink">factory system</a> was also introduced; in 1835 1,124 people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used <a href="power_loom" title="wikilink">power looms</a>. Local hand-produced specialities included striped <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a>, Ticks, Checks, <a href="Nankeen" title="wikilink">Nankeens</a>, and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 <a href="Ordnance_Survey" title="wikilink">Ordnance Survey</a> map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of <a href="silk" class="uri" title="wikilink">silk</a>, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many factory workers were children under 12 years of age.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1830 <a href="James_Nasmyth" title="wikilink">James Nasmyth</a> (son of <a href="Alexander_Nasmyth" title="wikilink">Alexander Nasmyth</a>) visited the newly opened <a href="Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" title="wikilink">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, and on his return to Manchester noted the suitability of a site alongside the canal at <a href="Patricroft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patricroft</a> for an engineering works.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He and his brother leased the land from <a href="Thomas_de_Trafford" title="wikilink">Thomas de Trafford</a>, and established the <a href="Nasmyth,_Gaskell_and_Company" title="wikilink">Bridgewater Foundry</a> in 1836. The foundry was completed the following year with a design based upon <a href="assembly_line" title="wikilink">assembly line</a> production. In 1839 Nasmyth invented the <a href="Steam_Hammer" title="wikilink">Steam Hammer</a> which enabled the manufacture of forgings at a scale and speed not seen before. In the same year the foundry started to manufacture railway <a href="locomotive" title="wikilink">locomotives</a>, with 109 built by 1853. Nasmyth died a wealthy man in 1890.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

Built in 1906 by the Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company, the building is to be demolished." /> The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company came into being following a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Early housing in the village consisted of groups of <a href="Thatching" title="wikilink">thatched</a> <a href="cottage" title="wikilink">cottages</a> clustered around and near the Parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after the establishment of the Local Board of Health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local <a href="Water_well" title="wikilink">well</a>. During the latter half of the 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The construction of the <a href="Manchester_Ship_Canal" title="wikilink">Manchester Ship Canal</a> provided many local residents with jobs. 1,888 people were employed on the section of the new canal at Barton. A stone aqueduct over the River Iwell dating from 1761 and designed by <a href="James_Brindley" title="wikilink">James Brindley</a> was demolished and replaced by a new moveable aqueduct: the <a href="Barton_Swing_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Barton Swing Aqueduct</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Eccles was not immune to the general decline of the textile industry in the 20th century. The Bridgewater Foundry ceased operations in 1940, taken over by the <a href="Ministry_of_Supply" title="wikilink">Ministry of Supply</a> and converted into a <a href="ROF_Patricroft" title="wikilink">Royal Ordnance Factory</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The factory closed in the late 1980s, and is now part of the Nasymth Business Centre.</p>
<p>Eccles is included in the City of Salford's Unitary Development Plan 2004–2016 as part of the Western Gateway, a major focus for economic development during the plan period. Areas to be developed include the Barton Strategic Regional Site, Dock 9 at Salford Quays, <a href="Weaste" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weaste</a> Quarry near Eccles, and remaining land at Northbank, and the plan provides for improvements which include the <a href="A57_road" title="wikilink">A57</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; Trafford Park link at Barton and provisional support for a further expansion of the <a href="Manchester_Metrolink" title="wikilink">Metrolink</a> system through the area and a link between the A57 and <a href="M62_motorway" title="wikilink">M62</a> at Barton.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Under this plan the town's retail environment would also be maintained and enhanced.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Eccles is the ninth most densely populated ward in Salford, and has the highest number and proportion of people aged 75 and over of all wards in Salford. Levels of crime are below the average for the city. The adult population tends to be more qualified than the city average, and primary and secondary education results are also slightly higher than average for Salford. Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours. More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than do in the city as a whole, with a minority occupying <a href="Single-family_detached_home" title="wikilink">detached</a> houses or <a href="bungalow" title="wikilink">bungalows</a>.

Opinions as to the quality of the road were mainly negative; writing in 1795, <a href="John_Aikin" title="wikilink">John Aikin</a> said &quot;Much Labour and a very great expense of money have been expended on the roads of this parish, but they still remain in a very indifferent state, and from one plain and obvious cause, the immoderate weights drawn in carts and waggons.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> On the poor quality roads, the Liverpool to Manchester <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> took almost an entire day to make the journey.

The railway provided a link between Eccles (located on the existing Liverpool and Manchester line), and Wigan. In 1870 an additional branch line from this, the Roe Green Loopline, was opened to Bolton to support the surrounding collieries, the largest of which was at Mosley Common.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The London and North Western Railway also built a line from <a href="Patricroft_railway_station" title="wikilink">Patricroft railway station</a> to <a href="Molyneux_Junction" title="wikilink">Molyneux Junction</a>, via <a href="Clifton_Hall_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Clifton Hall Tunnel</a> (built in 1849).<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The line connected with the <a href="East_Lancashire_Railway_1844&lt;U+2013&gt;1859" title="wikilink">East Lancashire Railway</a> to <a href="Radcliffe,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Radcliffe</a> and <a href="Bury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bury</a>.

<p>The <a href="M602_motorway" title="wikilink">M602 motorway</a> was opened throughout on 3 November 1971. The Borough Council had previously formed the Eccles Borough Council&lt;U+2019&gt;s General Purposes Committee, which from December 1962 began to purchase land for the route of the new road, while overseeing a powerful public relations scheme. A demolition programme commenced in January 1967, with some residents re-housed in newly-built housing stock. The council also had to arrange for the purchase of land at the interchange with the present-day <a href="M60_motorway" title="wikilink">M60</a>, and to re-route part of the <a href="Thirlmere_Aqueduct" title="wikilink">Thirlmere Aqueduct</a>. Construction began on 8 December 1969, along a route limited by the existence of housing estates, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the M62 junction at Worsley, and the Bridgewater Canal. Consideration was given to the route of the disused Eccles-Tyldesley-Wigan railway line; the height of the motorway was lowered to accommodate a new railway bridge in case the line was ever re-instated. The nearby bridge for the Clifton Junction branch railway was demolished with explosives.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>As the population of Eccles increased during the Industrial Revolution the medieval parish of Eccles was gradually divided into smaller parishes, and surrounding townships gained their own churches. The Grade II listed St Andrew's church in St Andrew's Parish was built in the 1870s and opened in 1879 (the tower was added in 1889). Over the next 40 years various decorative improvements were made to the building, including stone carvings, stained glass, and wall paintings (covered in 1965). Four months after the church was consecrated a church school was opened, the forerunner of the present St Andrew's Primary School. A second school in Monton (then part of the parish) opened in 1881.

Dating from the 18th century, they were first sold from a shop owned by James Birch in 1793. Traditionally made in the town from a recipe of <a href="flaky_pastry" title="wikilink">flaky pastry</a>, butter, <a href="nutmeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">nutmeg</a>, candied peel, sugar and <a href="Raisin" title="wikilink">currants</a>, they are sold across the country and exported across the world. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;dead fly pies&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
