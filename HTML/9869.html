<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Growing up in Toronto, Wheeler began playing cornet at age 12, and became interested in jazz in his mid-teens. Wheeler spent a year studying composition at the <a href="Royal_Conservatory_of_Music_(Toronto)" title="wikilink">Royal Conservatory in Toronto</a> in 1950. In 1952, Wheeler moved to Britain. He found his way into the London jazz scene of the time, playing in groups led by <a href="Tommy_Whittle" title="wikilink">Tommy Whittle</a>, <a href="Tubby_Hayes" title="wikilink">Tubby Hayes</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Scott" title="wikilink">Ronnie Scott</a>. Throughout the Sixties, he worked with <a href="John_Dankworth" title="wikilink">John Dankworth</a>, and also formed part of (<a href="Eric_Burdon" title="wikilink">Eric Burdon</a> and) <a href="The_Animals" title="wikilink">The Animals</a> Big Band that made its one-and-only public appearance at the <a href="National_Jazz_and_Blues_Festival" title="wikilink">5th Annual British Jazz &amp; Blues Festival</a> in Richmond (1965) with tenors <a href="Stan_Robinson_(jazz_musician)" title="wikilink">Stan Robinson</a>, <a href="Dick_Morrissey" title="wikilink">Dick Morrissey</a> and <a href="Al_Gay" title="wikilink">Al Gay</a>, baritone sax <a href="Paul_Carroll" title="wikilink">Paul Carroll</a>, and fellow trumpets <a href="Ian_Carr" title="wikilink">Ian Carr</a> and Greg Brown. In 1968, Wheeler appeared on guitarist <a href="Terry_Smith_(British_jazz_guitarist)" title="wikilink">Terry Smith</a>'s first solo album, <em>Fall Out</em>. Kenny Wheeler still lives in Britain today.</p>
<h3 id="writing-for-large-ensembles">Writing for large ensembles</h3>
<p>Kenny Wheeler has performed and recorded his own compositions with large jazz ensembles throughout his career, starting with his first album <em>Windmill Tilter</em>, (1969), recorded with the <a href="John_Dankworth" title="wikilink">John Dankworth</a> band. The <em>Windmill Tilter</em> LP today is a collector's item, since the original master tapes have been lost, though there are plans to remaster it from vinyl and reissue it on CD in 2007 on John Dankworth's Qnote label. The <a href="big_band" title="wikilink">big band</a> album <em>Song for Someone</em>, (1973, Incus10) fused Wheeler's characteristic orchestral writing with passages of free improvisation provided by musicians such as <a href="Evan_Parker" title="wikilink">Evan Parker</a> and <a href="Derek_Bailey" title="wikilink">Derek Bailey</a>, and was also named Album of the Year by <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> magazine in 1975. This has subsequently been reissued on CD by Evan Parker's Psi label (psi 04.01)</p>
<h3 id="improvised-music">Improvised music</h3>
<p>In the mid-1960s, Wheeler became a close participant in the nascent <a href="free_improvisation" title="wikilink">free improvisation</a> movement in London, playing with <a href="John_Stevens_(drummer)" title="wikilink">John Stevens</a>, <a href="Evan_Parker" title="wikilink">Evan Parker</a>, the <a href="Spontaneous_Music_Ensemble" title="wikilink">Spontaneous Music Ensemble</a> and the <a href="Globe_Unity_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Globe Unity Orchestra</a>. His involvement in this genre continues to this day.</p>
<h3 id="small-group-jazz">Small group jazz</h3>
<p>Despite the above-noted accomplishments, much of Wheeler's reputation rests on his work with smaller jazz groups. Wheeler's first small group recordings to gain significant critical attention were <em>Gnu High</em> (1975) and <em>Deer Wan</em> (1977), both for the ECM label.</p>
<p>Wheeler was the trumpet player in the <a href="Anthony_Braxton" title="wikilink">Anthony Braxton</a> Quartet from 1971 to 1976; and from 1977 he was also a member of chamber jazz group <a href="Azimuth_(group)" title="wikilink">Azimuth</a> (with <a href="John_Taylor_(jazz)" title="wikilink">John Taylor</a> and <a href="Norma_Winstone" title="wikilink">Norma Winstone</a>).</p>
<p>More recently, Wheeler received widespread critical praise for his 1997 album <em>Angel Song</em>, which featured an unusual &quot;drummerless&quot; quartet of <a href="Bill_Frisell" title="wikilink">Bill Frisell</a> (guitar), <a href="Dave_Holland" title="wikilink">Dave Holland</a> (bass) and <a href="Lee_Konitz" title="wikilink">Lee Konitz</a> (alto sax).</p>
<h3 id="critical-reaction">Critical reaction</h3>
<p><em>&quot;The Wheeler sound is one of the most distinctive in the history of the jazz trumpet. A thin, overblown note is followed by a florid flurry, the high squeal by a long low note he rolls around his mouth like a chewy mint. Although his phrases are bordered, like blotting paper in ink, with romanticism, the comforting phrase is superseded by the querulous, a moment of tenderness by a scream of panic. He has his trademark tics, but is incapable of producing a hackneyed phrase. Like words from a prophet, every note counts.&quot;</em></p>
