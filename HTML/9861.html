<p><strong>Zhao Hongyin</strong> (&lt;U+8D99&gt;&lt;U+5F18&gt;&lt;U+6BB7&gt;) (d. 956) was a military general in <a href="history_of_China" title="wikilink">imperial China</a>'s <a href="Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period" title="wikilink">Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period</a>.</p>
<p>After his death, his son <a href="Emperor_Taizu_of_Song" title="wikilink">Zhao Kuangyin</a> founded the <a href="Song_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Song Dynasty</a> in 960. Another son <a href="Emperor_Taizong_of_Song" title="wikilink">Zhao Kuangyi</a> would also become a Song <a href="emperor_of_China" title="wikilink">emperor</a>. For this reason Zhao Hongyin is posthumously honored as Emperor Xuanzu (&lt;U+5BA3&gt;&lt;U+7956&gt;) of Song.</p>

<p>The young Zhao Hongyin was a skilled <a href="horse_archery" title="wikilink">horse archer</a>. He originally served the warlord <a href="Wang_Rong" title="wikilink">Wang Rong</a> for the <a href="de_facto" title="wikilink">de facto</a> independent <a href="Zhao_(Five_Dynasties)" title="wikilink">Zhao</a> State, and was once ordered by Wang to lead 500 cavalries to assist their ally <a href="Li_Cunxu" title="wikilink">Li Cunxu</a> in battles, presumably against the <a href="Later_Liang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Later Liang Dynasty</a>. Impressed by his bravery, Li kept Zhao as part of his imperial army after the fall of Zhao in 921.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It was also around this period that he married Lady Du, 3 years his junior.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> According to rumors popular a few decades after his death, when Zhao Hongyin first came to the area by himself, he encountered a snowstorm and had to beg for food from servants in official Du Shuang's (&lt;U+675C&gt;&lt;U+723D&gt;) house. After a few days, the servants noticed him hardworking and persuaded Du in keeping him in the house. A few months later, the family arranged for him to marry their eldest daughter.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
