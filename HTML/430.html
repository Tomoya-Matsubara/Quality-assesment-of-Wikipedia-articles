<p>In <a href="physical_cosmology" title="wikilink">physical cosmology</a>, <strong>cosmic inflation</strong> is the idea that the nascent <a href="universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">universe</a> passed through a phase of <a href="exponential_growth" title="wikilink">exponential</a> <a href="metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">expansion</a> that was driven by a <a href="negative_pressure" title="wikilink">negative-pressure</a> <a href="vacuum_energy" title="wikilink">vacuum energy</a> density.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As a direct consequence of this expansion, all of the observable universe originated in a small <a href="Causality_(physics)" title="wikilink">causally-connected</a> region. Inflation answers the classic conundrums of the <a href="big_bang" title="wikilink">big bang</a> cosmology: why does the universe appear <a href="shape_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">flat</a>, <a href="homogeneous" class="uri" title="wikilink">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropic" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotropic</a> in accordance with the <a href="cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">cosmological principle</a> when one would expect, on the basis of the physics of the big bang, a highly curved, inhomogeneous universe. Inflation also explains the origin of the <a href="large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos" title="wikilink">large-scale structure of the cosmos</a>. <a href="Quantum_fluctuation" title="wikilink">Quantum fluctuations</a> in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the universe (see <a href="galaxy_formation_and_evolution" title="wikilink">galaxy formation and evolution</a> and <a href="structure_formation" title="wikilink">structure formation</a>).</p>
<p>Inflation was first proposed by American physicist and cosmologist <a href="Alan_Guth" title="wikilink">Alan Guth</a> in 1981<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and was given its modern form independently by <a href="Andrei_Linde" title="wikilink">Andrei Linde</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and by <a href="Andreas_Albrecht" title="wikilink">Andreas Albrecht</a> and <a href="Paul_Steinhardt" title="wikilink">Paul Steinhardt</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>While the detailed <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> mechanism responsible for inflation is not known, the basic picture makes a number of predictions that have been confirmed by observational tests. Inflation is thus now considered part of the standard hot <a href="big_bang" title="wikilink">big bang</a> cosmology. The hypothetical <a href="elementary_particle" title="wikilink">particle</a> or <a href="field_(physics)" title="wikilink">field</a> thought to be responsible for inflation is called the <strong><a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Inflation suggests that there was a period of exponential expansion in the very early universe. The expansion is exponential because the distance between any two fixed observers is increasing exponentially, due to the <a href="metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">metric expansion of space</a> (a spacetime with this property is called a <a href="de_Sitter_space" title="wikilink">de Sitter space</a>). The physical conditions from one moment to the next are stable: the rate of expansion, called the <a href="Hubble_parameter" title="wikilink">Hubble parameter</a>, is nearly constant, which leads to high levels of symmetry. Inflation is often called a period of <em>accelerated expansion</em> because the distance between two fixed observers is increasing at an accelerating rate as they move apart. (However, this does not mean that the Hubble parameter is increasing, see <a href="deceleration_parameter" title="wikilink">deceleration parameter</a>.)</p>
<p>Cosmic inflation has the important effect of smoothing out <a href="homogeneity_(physics)" title="wikilink">inhomogeneities</a>, <a href="anisotropy" title="wikilink">anisotropies</a> and the <a href="shape_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">curvature of space</a>. This pushes the universe into a very simple state, in which it is completely dominated by the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> field and the only significant inhomogeneities are the tiny quantum fluctuations in the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a>. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the <a href="magnetic_monopole" title="wikilink">magnetic monopoles</a> predicted by many extensions to the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a>. If the universe was only hot enough to form such particles <em>before</em> a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the observable universe. Together, these effects are called the inflationary &quot;no-hair theorem&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> by analogy with the <a href="no_hair_theorem" title="wikilink">no hair theorem</a> for <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black holes</a>.</p>
<p>The &quot;no-hair&quot; theorem works essentially because the universe expands by an enormous factor during inflation. In an expanding universe, <a href="energy_density" title="wikilink">energy densities</a> generally fall as the volume of the universe increases. For example, the density of ordinary &quot;cold&quot; matter (dust) goes as the inverse of the volume: when linear dimensions double, the energy density goes down by a factor of eight. The energy density in radiation goes down even more rapidly as the universe expands: when linear dimensions are doubled, the energy density in radiation falls by a factor of sixteen. During inflation, the energy density in the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> field is roughly constant. However, the energy density in inhomogeneities, curvature, anisotropies and exotic particles is falling, and through sufficient inflation these become negligible. This leaves an empty, flat, and symmetric universe, which is filled with radiation when inflation ends.</p>
<p>A key requirement is that inflation must continue long enough to produce the present observable universe from a single, small inflationary <a href="Hubble_volume" title="wikilink">Hubble volume</a>. This is necessary to ensure that the universe appears flat, homogeneous and isotropic at the largest observable scales. This requirement is generally thought to be satisfied if the universe expanded by a factor of at least 10<sup>26</sup> during inflation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the end of inflation, a process called <em>reheating</em> occurs, in which the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> particles <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">decay</a> into the radiation that starts the hot big bang. It is not known how long inflation lasted but it is usually thought to be extremely short compared to the age of the universe. Assuming that the energy scale of inflation is between 10<sup>15</sup> and 10 <sup>16</sup> <a href="GeV" class="uri" title="wikilink">GeV</a>, as is suggested by the simplest models, the period of inflation responsible for the observable universe probably lasted roughly 10<sup>-33</sup> seconds.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Inflation resolves <a href="Big_Bang#Features,_issues_and_problems" title="wikilink">several problems</a> in the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a> cosmology that were pointed out in the 1970s.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> These problems arise from the observation that to look like it does <em>today,</em> the universe would have to have started from very finely tuned, or &quot;special&quot; initial conditions near the Big Bang. Inflation resolves these problems by providing a dynamical mechanism that drives the universe to this special state, thus making a universe like ours much more natural in the context of the Big Bang theory.</p>
<h3 id="horizon-problem">Horizon problem</h3>

<p>The <a href="horizon_problem" title="wikilink">horizon problem</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> is the problem of determining why the universe appears statistically homogeneous and isotropic in accordance with the <a href="cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">cosmological principle</a>. The gas molecules in a canister of gas are distributed homogeneously and isotropically because they are in thermal equilibrium: gas throughout the canister has had enough time to interact to dissipate inhomogeneities and anisotropies. The situation is quite different in the big bang model without inflation, because gravitational expansion does not give the early universe enough time to equilibrate. In a big bang with only the <a href="matter" class="uri" title="wikilink">matter</a> and <a href="radiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiation</a> known in the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a>, two widely separated regions of the observable universe cannot have equilibrated because they have never come in to <a href="causal_contact" title="wikilink">causal contact</a>: in the history of the universe, back to the earliest times, it has not been possible to send a light signal between the two regions. Because they have no interaction, it is impossible that they have equilibrated. This is because the <a href="Hubble_radius" title="wikilink">Hubble radius</a> in a radiation- or matter-dominated universe expands much more quickly than physical lengths and so points that are out of communication are coming into communication. Historically, two proposed solutions were the <a href="Phoenix_universe" title="wikilink">Phoenix universe</a> of <a href="Georges_Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre" title="wikilink">Georges Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre</a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and the related <a href="oscillatory_universe" title="wikilink">oscillatory universe</a> of <a href="Richard_Chase_Tolman" title="wikilink">Richard Chase Tolman</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the <a href="Mixmaster_universe" title="wikilink">Mixmaster universe</a> of <a href="Charles_Misner" title="wikilink">Charles Misner</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Lema&lt;U+00EE&gt;tre and Tolman proposed that a universe undergoing a number of cycles of contraction and expansion could come into thermal equilibrium. Their models failed, however, because of the buildup of <a href="entropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">entropy</a> over several cycles. Misner made the (ultimately incorrect) conjecture that the Mixmaster mechanism, which made the universe <em>more</em> chaotic, could lead to statistical homogeneity and isotropy.</p>
<h3 id="flatness-problem">Flatness problem</h3>

<p>Another problem is the <a href="flatness_problem" title="wikilink">flatness problem</a> (which is sometimes called one of the Dicke coincidences, with the other being the <a href="cosmological_constant_problem" title="wikilink">cosmological constant problem</a>).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It had been known in the 1960s that the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the <a href="critical_density" title="wikilink">critical density</a> necessary for a flat universe (that is, a universe whose large scale <a href="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</a> is the usual <a href="Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">Euclidean geometry</a>, rather than a <a href="non-Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">non-Euclidean</a> <a href="hyperbolic_geometry" title="wikilink">hyperbolic</a> or <a href="spherical_geometry" title="wikilink">spherical geometry</a>). Therefore, regardless of the <a href="shape_of_the_universe" title="wikilink">shape of the universe</a> the contribution of spatial curvature to the expansion of the universe could not be much greater than the contribution of matter. But as the universe expands, the curvature <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifts</a> away more slowly than matter and radiation. Extrapolated into the past, this presents a <a href="fine-tuning" class="uri" title="wikilink">fine-tuning</a> problem because the contribution of curvature to the universe must be exponentially small (sixteen orders of magnitude less than the density of radiation at <a href="big_bang_nucleosynthesis" title="wikilink">big bang nucleosynthesis</a>, for example). This problem is exacerbated by recent observations of the cosmic microwave background that have demonstrated that the universe is flat to the accuracy of a few percent.</p>
<h3 id="magnetic-monopole-problem">Magnetic monopole problem</h3>
<p>The <a href="magnetic_monopole_problem" title="wikilink">magnetic monopole problem</a> (sometimes called the exotic relics problem) is a problem that suggests that if the early universe were very hot, a large number of very heavy, stable <a href="magnetic_monopoles" title="wikilink">magnetic monopoles</a> would be produced. This was a problem with <a href="Grand_Unified_Theory" title="wikilink">Grand Unified Theories</a>, which were popular in the <a href="1970" title="wikilink">1970s</a> and <a href="1980" title="wikilink">1980s</a>, proposed that at high temperatures (such as in the early universe) the <a href="electromagnetic_force" title="wikilink">electromagnetic force</a>, <a href="strong_nuclear_force" title="wikilink">strong</a> and <a href="weak_nuclear_force" title="wikilink">weak</a> <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear forces</a> are not actually fundamental forces but arise due to <a href="spontaneous_symmetry_breaking" title="wikilink">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a> from a much simpler <a href="gauge_theory" title="wikilink">gauge theory</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> These theories predict a number of heavy, stable particles which have not yet been observed in nature. The most notorious is the <a href="magnetic_monopole" title="wikilink">magnetic monopole</a>, a kind of stable, heavy &quot;knot&quot; in the magnetic field.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Monopoles are expected to be copiously produced in Grand Unified Theories at high temperature, and they should have persisted to the present day.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> To very high precision, magnetic monopoles have been shown not to exist in nature<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> whereas according to the big bang theory (without cosmic inflation) they should have been copiously produced in the hot, dense early universe and since become the primary constituent of the universe.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Inflation was proposed in 1981 by <a href="Alan_Guth" title="wikilink">Alan Guth</a> as a mechanism for resolving these problems.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There were several precursors, most importantly the work of <a href="Willem_de_Sitter" title="wikilink">Willem de Sitter</a> which demonstrated the existence of a highly symmetric inflating universe, called <a href="de_Sitter_space" title="wikilink">de Sitter space</a>. De Sitter, however, didn't apply it to any of the cosmological problems that interested Guth.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Contemporary with Guth, <a href="Alexei_Starobinsky" title="wikilink">Alexei Starobinsky</a> argued that quantum corrections to gravity would replace the initial singularity of the universe with an exponentially expanding state.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Demosthenes Kazanas anticipated part of Guth's work by suggesting that exponential expansion could eliminate the <a href="particle_horizon" title="wikilink">particle horizon</a> and perhaps solve the horizon problem,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and Sato suggesting that an exponential expansion could eliminate <a href="domain_wall" title="wikilink">domain walls</a> (another kind of exotic relic).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, Guth was the first to assemble a complete picture of how all these initial conditions problems could be solved by an exponentially expanding state.</p>

</figure>
<p>Guth proposed that as the early universe cooled, it was trapped in a <a href="false_vacuum" title="wikilink">false vacuum</a> with a high energy density, which is much like a <a href="cosmological_constant" title="wikilink">cosmological constant</a>. As the very early universe cooled it was trapped in a <a href="metastability" title="wikilink">metastable</a> state (it was <a href="supercooling" title="wikilink">supercooled</a>) which it could only decay out of through the process of <a href="nucleation" title="wikilink">bubble nucleation</a> via <a href="quantum_tunneling" title="wikilink">quantum tunneling</a>. Bubbles of <a href="vacuum_state" title="wikilink">true vacuum</a> spontaneously form in the sea of false vacuum and rapidly begin expanding at the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>. Guth recognized that this model was problematic because the model did not reheat properly: when the bubbles nucleated, they did not generate any radiation. Radiation could only be generated in collisions between bubble walls. But if inflation lasted long enough to solve the initial conditions problems, collisions between bubbles became exceedingly rare. (Even though the bubbles are expanding at the speed of light, the bubbles are far enough apart that the <a href="metric_expansion_of_space" title="wikilink">expansion of space</a> is causing the distance between them to expand much faster.)</p>
<p>This problem was solved by <a href="Andrei_Linde" title="wikilink">Andrei Linde</a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and independently by <a href="Andreas_Albrecht" title="wikilink">Andreas Albrecht</a> and <a href="Paul_Steinhardt" title="wikilink">Paul Steinhardt</a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> in a model named <em>new inflation</em> or <em>slow-roll inflation</em> (Guth's model then became known as <em>old inflation</em>). In this model, instead of tunneling out of a false vacuum state, inflation occurred by a <a href="scalar_field" title="wikilink">scalar field</a> rolling down a potential energy hill. When the field rolls very slowly compared to the expansion of the universe, inflation occurs. However, when the hill becomes steeper, inflation ends and reheating can occur.</p>
<p>Eventually, it was shown that new inflation does not produce a perfectly symmetric universe, but that tiny quantum fluctuations in the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> are created. These tiny fluctuations form the primordial seeds for all structure created in the later universe. These fluctuations were first calculated by <a href="Viatcheslav_Mukhanov" title="wikilink">Viatcheslav Mukhanov</a> and G. V. Chibisov in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> in analyzing Starobinsky's similar model.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the context of inflation, they were worked out independently of the work of Mukhanov and Chibisov at the three-week 1982 Nuffield Workshop on the Very Early Universe at <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The fluctuations were calculated by four groups working separately over the course of the workshop: <a href="Stephen_Hawking" title="wikilink">Stephen Hawking</a>;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Starobinsky;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Guth and <a href="So-Young_Pi" title="wikilink">So-Young Pi</a>;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and <a href="James_M._Bardeen" title="wikilink">James M.

<h2 id="observational-status">Observational status</h2>
<p>Inflation is a concrete mechanism for realizing the <a href="cosmological_principle" title="wikilink">cosmological principle</a> which is the basis of our model of physical cosmology: it accounts for the homogeneity, isotropy of the observable universe. In addition, it accounts for the observed flatness and absence of magnetic monopoles. Since Guth's early work, each of these observations has received further confirmation, most impressively by the detailed observations of the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background</a> made by the <a href="Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe" title="wikilink">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) satellite.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This analysis shows that the universe is flat to an accuracy of at least a few percent, and that it is homogeneous and isotropic to a part in 10,000.</p>
<p>In addition, inflation predicts that the structures visible in the universe today formed through the gravitational collapse of perturbations which were formed as quantum mechanical fluctuations in the inflationary epoch. The detailed form of the spectrum of perturbations called a <a href="scale_invariance#Cosmology" title="wikilink">nearly-scale-invariant</a> <a href="Gaussian_random_field" title="wikilink">Gaussian random field</a> (or Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum) is very specific and has only two free parameters, the amplitude of the spectrum and the <em>spectral index</em> which measures the slight deviation from scale invariance predicted by inflation (perfect scale invariance corresponds to the idealized de Sitter universe).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Inflation predicts that the observed perturbations should be in <a href="thermal_equilibrium" title="wikilink">thermal equilibrium</a> with each other (these are called <em>adiabatic</em> or <em>isentropic</em> perturbations). This structure for the perturbations has been confirmed by the WMAP satellite and other cosmic microwave background experiments,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and <a href="galaxy_survey" title="wikilink">galaxy surveys</a>, especially the ongoing <a href="Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey" title="wikilink">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> These experiments have shown that the one part in 10,000 inhomogeneities observed have exactly the form predicted by theory. Moreover, the slight deviation from scale invariance has been measured. The <em>spectral index</em>, <em>n</em><sub>s</sub> is equal to one for a scale-invariant spectrum. The simplest models of inflation predict that this quantity is between 0.92 and 0.98.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The WMAP satellite has measured <em>n</em><sub>s</sub> = 0.95 and shown that it is different from one at the level of two <a href="standard_deviation" title="wikilink">standard deviations</a> (2σ). This is considered an important confirmation of the theory of inflation.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of theories of inflation have been proposed that make radically different predictions, but they generally have much more <a href="fine-tuning" title="wikilink">fine tuning</a> than is necessary.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> As a physical model, however, inflation is most valuable in that it robustly predicts the initial conditions of the universe based on only two adjustable parameters: the spectral index (that can only change in a small range) and the amplitude of the perturbations. Except in contrived models, this is true regardless of how inflation is realized in particle physics.</p>
<p>Occasionally, effects are observed that appear to contradict the simplest models of inflation. The first-year WMAP data suggested that the spectrum might not be nearly scale-invariant, but might instead have a slight curvature.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> However, the third-year data revealed that the effect was a statistical anomaly.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Another effect has been remarked upon since the first cosmic microwave background satellite, the <a href="Cosmic_Background_Explorer" title="wikilink">Cosmic Background Explorer</a>: the amplitude of the <a href="quadrupole_moment" title="wikilink">quadrupole moment</a> of the cosmic microwave background is unexpectedly low and the other low multipoles appear to be preferentially aligned with the <a href="ecliptic_plane" title="wikilink">ecliptic plane</a>. Some have claimed that this is a signature of non-Gaussianity and thus contradicts the simplest models of inflation. Others have suggested that the effect may be due to other new physics, foreground contamination, or even <a href="publication_bias" title="wikilink">publication bias</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>An experimental program is underway to further test inflation with more precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background. In particular, high precision measurements of the so-called &quot;B-modes&quot; of the <a href="Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#Polarization" title="wikilink">polarization</a> of the background radiation will be evidence of the <a href="gravitational_radiation" title="wikilink">gravitational radiation</a> produced by inflation, and they will also show whether the energy scale of inflation predicted by the simplest models (10<sup>15</sup>–10<sup>16</sup> <a href="GeV" class="uri" title="wikilink">GeV</a>) is correct.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> These measurements are expected to be performed by the <a href="Planck_(satellite)" title="wikilink">Planck satellite</a>, although it is unclear if the signal will be visible, or if contamination from foreground sources will interfere with these measurements.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Other forthcoming measurements, such as those of <a href="21_centimeter_radiation" title="wikilink">21 centimeter radiation</a> (radiation emitted and absorbed from neutral hydrogen before the <a href="population_III_star" title="wikilink">first stars</a> turned on), may measure the power spectrum with even greater resolution than the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, although it is not known if these measurements will be possible or if interference with <a href="radio_frequency" title="wikilink">radio sources</a> on earth and in the galaxy will be too great.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2006, it is unclear what relationship if any the period of cosmic inflation has to do with <a href="dark_energy" title="wikilink">dark energy</a>. Dark energy is broadly similar to inflation, and is thought to be causing the expansion of the present-day universe to accelerate. However, the energy scale of dark energy is much lower, 10<sup>-12</sup> GeV, roughly 27 <a href="orders_of_magnitude" title="wikilink">orders of magnitude</a> less than the scale of inflation.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-status">Theoretical status</h2>

<p>In the early proposal of Guth, it was thought that the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> was the <a href="Higgs_field" title="wikilink">Higgs field</a>, the field which explains the mass of the elementary particles.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> It is now known that the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> cannot be the Higgs field. Other models of inflation relied on the properties of grand unified theories.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Since the simplest models of <a href="grand_unification" title="wikilink">grand unification</a> have failed, it is now thought by many physicists that inflation will be included in a <a href="supersymmetric" class="uri" title="wikilink">supersymmetric</a> theory like <a href="string_theory" title="wikilink">string theory</a> or a supersymmetric grand unified theory. A promising suggestion is <a href="brane_inflation" title="wikilink">brane inflation</a>. At present, however, inflation is understood principally by its detailed predictions of the <a href="boundary_condition" title="wikilink">initial conditions</a> for the hot early universe, and the particle physics is largely <em>ad hoc</em> modelling. As such, despite the stringent observational tests inflation has passed, there are many open questions about the theory.</p>
<h3 id="fine-tuning-problem">Fine-tuning problem</h3>
<p>One of the most severe challenges for inflation arises from the need for <a href="fine_tuning" title="wikilink">fine tuning</a> in inflationary theories. In new inflation, the <em>slow-roll conditions</em> must be satisfied for inflation to occur. The slow-roll conditions say that the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> <a href="scalar_potential" title="wikilink">potential</a> must be flat (compared to the large <a href="vacuum_energy" title="wikilink">vacuum energy</a>) and that the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> particles must have a small mass.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In order for the new inflation theory of Linde, Albrecht and Steinhardt to be successful, therefore, it seemed that the universe must have a scalar field with an especially flat potential and special initial conditions.</p>
<p>Andrei Linde proposed a theory known as <em>chaotic inflation</em> in which he suggested that the conditions for inflation are actually satisfied quite generically and inflation will occur in virtually any universe that begins in a chaotic, high energy state and has a scalar field with unbounded potential energy.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> However, in his model the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> field necessarily takes values larger than one Planck unit: for this reason, these are often called <em>large field</em> models and the competing new inflation models are called <em>small field</em> models. In this situation, the predictions of <a href="effective_field_theory" title="wikilink">effective field theory</a> are thought to be invalid, and <a href="renormalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">renormalization</a> should cause large corrections that could prevent inflation.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This problem has not yet been resolved and some cosmologists argue that the small field models, in which inflation can occur at a much lower energy scale, are better models of inflation.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> While inflation depends on quantum field theory (and the <a href="semiclassical_gravity" title="wikilink">semiclassical approximation</a> to <a href="quantum_gravity" title="wikilink">quantum gravity</a>) in an important way, it has not been completely reconciled with these theories.</p>
<p><a href="Robert_Brandenberger" title="wikilink">Robert Brandenberger</a> has commented on fine-tuning in another situation.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The amplitude of the primordial inhomogeneities produced in inflation is directly tied to the energy scale of inflation. There are strong suggestions that this scale is around 10<sup>16</sup> <a href="GeV" class="uri" title="wikilink">GeV</a> or 10<sup>−3</sup> times the <a href="Planck_energy" title="wikilink">Planck energy</a>. The natural scale is na&lt;U+00EF&gt;vely the Planck scale so this small value could be seen as another form of fine-tuning (called a <a href="hierarchy_problem" title="wikilink">hierarchy problem</a>): the energy density given by the scalar potential is down by 10<sup>−12</sup> compared to the <a href="Planck_density" title="wikilink">Planck density</a>. This is not usually considered to be a critical problem, however, because the scale of inflation corresponds naturally to the scale of <a href="gauge_unification" title="wikilink">gauge unification</a>.</p>
<h3 id="eternal-inflation">Eternal inflation</h3>
<p>Cosmic inflation seems to be eternal the way it is theorised. Although new inflation is classically rolling down the potential, quantum fluctuations can sometimes bring it back up to previous levels. These regions in which the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> fluctuates upwards expand much faster than regions in which the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> has a lower potential energy, and tend to dominate in terms of physical volume. This steady state, which first developed by Vilenkin,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> is called &quot;eternal inflation&quot;. It has been shown that any inflationary theory with an unbounded potential is eternal.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> It is a popular belief among physicists that this steady state cannot continue forever into the past.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The inflationary spacetime, which is similar to <a href="de_Sitter_space" title="wikilink">de Sitter space</a>, is incomplete without a contracting region. However, unlike de Sitter space, fluctuations in a contracting inflationary space will collapse to form a <a href="gravitational_singularity" title="wikilink">gravitational singularity</a>, a point where densities become infinite. Therefore, it is necessary to have a theory for the universe's intial conditions. This interpretation is disputed by Linde, however.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="initial-conditions">Initial conditions</h3>
<p>Some physicists have tried to avoid this problem by proposing models for an eternally inflating universe with no origin.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> These models propose a special &quot;initial&quot; hypersurface when the universe has some minimum size and from which time begins.</p>
<p>Other proposals attempt to describe the ex nihilo creation of the universe <a href="quantum_cosmology" title="wikilink">quantum cosmology</a> and the following inflation. Vilenkin put forth one such scenario.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Hartle and Hawking proposed the <a href="no-boundary_proposal" title="wikilink">no-boundary proposal</a> for the initial creation of the universe in which inflation comes about naturally.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Alan Guth has described the inflationary universe as the &quot;ultimate free lunch&quot;:<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> new universes, similar to our own, are continually produced in a vast inflating background. Gravitational interactions, in this case, circumvent (but do not violate) both the <a href="first_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">first law of thermodynamics</a> or <a href="energy_conservation" title="wikilink">energy conservation</a> and the <a href="second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">second law of thermodynamics</a> or the <a href="arrow_of_time" title="wikilink">arrow of time</a> problem. However, while there is consensus that this solves the initial conditions problem, some have disputed this, as it is much more likely that the universe came about by a quantum fluctuation. Donald Page was an outspoken critic of inflation because of this anomaly. <a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He stressed that the thermodynamic <a href="arrow_of_time" title="wikilink">arrow of time</a> necessitates low <a href="entropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">entropy</a> initial conditions, which would be highly unlikely. According to them, rather than solving this problem, the inflation theory further aggravates it – the reheating at the end of the inflation era increases entropy, making it necessary for the initial state of the Universe to be even more orderly than in other Big Bang theories with no inflation phase.</p>
<p>Hawking and Page later found ambiguous results when they attempted to compute the probability of inflation in the Hartle-Hawking initial state.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Other authors have argued that, since inflation is eternal, the probability doesn't matter as long as it is not precisely zero: once it starts, inflation perpetuates itself and quickly dominates the universe. Recently, Lisa Dyson, Matthew Kleban and <a href="Leonard_Susskind" title="wikilink">Leonard Susskind</a> argued using the <a href="holographic_principle" title="wikilink">holographic principle</a> that spontaneous inflation is exceedingly improbable.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Albrecht and Lorenzo Sorbo have argued that the probability of an inflationary cosmos, consistent with today's observations, emerging by a random fluctuation from some pre-existent state, <em>compared</em> with a non-inflationary cosmos overwhelmingly favours the inflationary scenario, simply because the &quot;seed&quot; amount of non-gravitational energy required for the inflationary cosmos is so much less than any required for a non-inflationary alternative, which outweighs any entropic considerations.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Another problem that has occasionally been mentioned is the trans-Planckian problem or trans-Planckian effects.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Since the energy scale of inflation and the Planck scale are relatively close, some of the quantum fluctuations which have made up the structure in our universe were smaller than the Planck length before inflation. Therefore, there ought to be corrections from Planck-scale physics, in particular the unknown quantum theory of gravity. There has been some disagreement about the magnitude of this effect: about whether it is just on the threshold of detectability or completely undetectable.</p>
<h3 id="reheating">Reheating</h3>
<p>The end of inflation is called reheating or thermalization because the large potential energy decays into particles and fills the universe with radiation. Because the nature of the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> is not known, this process is still poorly understood, although it is believed to take place through a <a href="parametric_resonance" title="wikilink">parametric resonance</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="non-eternal-inflation">Non-eternal inflation</h3>
<p>Another kind of inflation, called <em>hybrid inflation</em>, is an extension of new inflation. It introduces additional scalar fields, so that while one of the scalar fields is responsible for normal slow roll inflation, another triggers the end of inflation: when inflation has continued for sufficiently long, it becomes favorable to the second field to decay into a much lower energy state.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Unlike most other models of inflation, many versions of hybrid inflation are not eternal. <a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> <a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>In hybrid inflation, one of the scalar fields is responsible for most of the energy density (thus determining the rate of expansion), while the other is responsible for the slow roll (thus determining the period of inflation and its termination). Thus fluctuations in the former inflaton would not affect inflation termination, while fluctuations in the latter would not affect the rate of expansion. Therefore hybrid inflation is not eternal. When the second (slow-rolling) inflaton reaches at the bottom of its potential, it changes the location of the minimum of the first inflaton's potential, which leads to a fast roll of the this inflaton down its potential, leading to termination of inflation.</p>
<h3 id="inflation-and-string-cosmology">Inflation and string cosmology</h3>
<p>The discovery of <a href="flux_compactification" title="wikilink">flux compactifications</a> have opened the way to reconciling inflation and string theory.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> A new theory, called <a href="brane_inflation" title="wikilink">brane inflation</a> suggests that inflation arises from a <a href="D-brane" class="uri" title="wikilink">D-brane</a> falling into a deep <a href="Klebanov-Strassler_throat" title="wikilink">Klebanov-Strassler throat</a>. This is a very different theory than ordinary inflation (it is governed by the <a href="Dirac-Born-Infeld_action" title="wikilink">Dirac-Born-Infeld action</a> which is very different than the other one) and the dynamics are still being understood. It appears that very special conditions are necessary for inflation occurs in tunneling between two vacua in the <a href="string_landscape" title="wikilink">string landscape</a> (the process of tunneling between two vacua is a kind of old inflation, but new inflation must then occur by some other mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives-to-inflation">Alternatives to inflation</h3>
<p><a href="String_theory" title="wikilink">String theory</a> requires that, in addition to the three spatial dimensions we observe, there exist additional dimensions that are curled up or <a href="compactification_(physics)" title="wikilink">compactified</a> (see also <a href="Kaluza-Klein_theory" title="wikilink">Kaluza-Klein theory</a>). Extra dimensions appear as a frequent component of <a href="supergravity" class="uri" title="wikilink">supergravity</a> models and other approaches to <a href="quantum_gravity" title="wikilink">quantum gravity</a>. This begs the question: why did four space-time dimensions become large, and the rest become unobservably small? An attempt to address this question, called <a href="string_gas_cosmology" title="wikilink">string gas cosmology</a>, was proposed by <a href="Robert_Brandenberger" title="wikilink">Robert Brandenberger</a> and <a href="Cumrun_Vafa" title="wikilink">Cumrun Vafa</a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a>. This model focuses on the dynamics of the early universe considered as a hot gas of strings. Brandenberger and Vafa show that a dimension of <a href="spacetime" class="uri" title="wikilink">spacetime</a> can only expand if the strings that wind around it can efficiently annihilate each other. Each string is a one-dimensional object, and the largest number of dimensions in which two strings will <a href="transversality" title="wikilink">generically intersect</a> (and, presumably, annihilate) is three. Therefore, one argues that the most likely number of non-compact (large) spatial dimensions is three. Current work on this model centers on whether it can succeed in stabilizing the size of the compactified dimensions and produce the correct spectrum of primordial density perturbations. For a recent review, see <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="ekpyrotic" class="uri" title="wikilink">ekpyrotic</a> and <a href="cyclic_model" title="wikilink">cyclic models</a> are also considered competitors to inflation. These models solve the <a href="horizon_problem" title="wikilink">horizon problem</a> through an expanding epoch well <em>before</em> the Big Bang, and then generate the required spectrum of primordial density perturbations during a contracting phase leading to a <a href="Big_Crunch" title="wikilink">Big Crunch</a>. The universe passes through the Big Crunch and emerges in a hot <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a> phase. In this sense they are reminiscent of the <a href="oscillatory_universe" title="wikilink">oscillatory universe</a> proposed by <a href="Richard_Chace_Tolman" title="wikilink">Richard Chace Tolman</a>: however in Tolman's model the total age of the universe is necessarily finite, while in these models this is not necessarily so. Whether the correct spectrum of density fluctuations can be produced, and whether the universe can successfully navigate the Big Bang/Big Crunch transition, remains a topic of controversy and current research.</p>

<li id="fn19">The importance of grand unification has waned somewhat since the early <a href="1990" title="wikilink">1990s</a>, as the simplest theories have been ruled out by <a href="proton_decay" title="wikilink">proton decay</a> experiments. However, many people still believe that a <a href="supersymmetry" title="wikilink">supersymmetric</a> Grand Unified Theory is built into <a href="string_theory" title="wikilink">string theory</a>, so it is still seen as a triumph for inflation that it is able to deal with these relics.

<li id="fn41">Perturbations can be represented by <a href="Fourier_modes" title="wikilink">Fourier modes</a> of a given <a href="wavelength" class="uri" title="wikilink">wavelength</a>. Each Fourier mode is <a href="normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normally distributed</a> (usually called Gaussian) with mean zero. Different Fourier components are uncorrelated. The variance of a mode depends only on its wavelength in such a way that within any given volume each wavelength contributes an equal amount of <a href="spectral_density" title="wikilink">power</a> to the spectrum of perturbations. Since the Fourier transform is in three dimensions, this means that the variance of a mode goes as <em>k</em><sup>−3</sup> to compensate for the fact that within any volume, the number of modes with a given wavenumber <em>k</em> goes as <em>k</em><sup>3</sup>.<a href="#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn62">Technically, this is because the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> potential is expressed as a Taylor series in φ/<em>m</em><sub>Pl</sub>, where φ is the <a href="inflaton" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflaton</a> and <em>m</em><sub>Pl</sub> is the Planck mass. While for a single term, such as the mass term <em>m</em><sub>φ</sub><sup>4</sup>(φ/<em>m</em><sub>Pl</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the slow roll conditions can be satisfied for φ much greater than <em>m</em><sub>Pl</sub>, this is precisely the situation in effective field theory in which higher order terms would be expected to contribute and destroy the conditions for inflation.
