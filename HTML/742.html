<p>The <strong>Getae</strong> or <strong>Gets</strong> (, singular ; ; ) are names given to several <a href="Thracians" title="wikilink">Thracian</a> tribes inhabiting the regions to either side of the <a href="Danube" title="wikilink">Lower Danube</a>, in what is today northern <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> and southern <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>. Both the singular form <strong>Get</strong> and Getae may be derived from a Greek <a href="exonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">exonym</a>: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the <a href="Ancient_Greeks" title="wikilink">Ancient Greeks</a> from an early date.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-sources">Ancient sources</h3>
<p><a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a>, one of the first ancient sources to mention Getae and Dacians, stated in his <em><a href="Geographica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geographica</a></em> (ca. 7 BC-20 AD) that the Dacians lived in the western parts of <a href="Dacia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dacia</a>, &quot;towards <a href="Germania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germania</a> and the sources of the Danube&quot;, and the Getae in the eastern parts, towards the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a>, both south and north of the Danube. The ancient geographer also wrote that the Dacians and Getae spoke the same language, after stating the same about Getae and Thracians.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a>, in his <em><a href="Naturalis_Historia" title="wikilink">Naturalis Historia</a></em> (Natural History), ca. 77-79 AD, provides a similar view: &quot;... though various races have occupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the <em>Getae</em>, by the Romans called <em>Daci</em>...&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="Appian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Appian</a>, who began writing his <em><a href="Roman_History_(Appian)" title="wikilink">Roman History</a></em> under <a href="Antoninus_Pius" title="wikilink">Antoninus Pius</a>, Roman Emperor from 138 to 161, noted: &lt;U+201C&gt;[B]ut going beyond these rivers in places they rule some of the <a href="Celts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celts</a> over the <a href="Rhine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhine</a> and the Getae over the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>, whom they call Dacians&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Junianus_Justinus" title="wikilink">Justin</a>, the 3rd century AD Latin historian, wrote in his <em><a href="Epitome_of_Pompeius_Trogus" title="wikilink">Epitome of Pompeius Trogus</a></em> that Dacians are spoken of as descendents of the Getae: <em>&quot;Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt&quot;</em> (The Dacians as well are a <a href="Kinship" title="wikilink">scion</a> of the Getae).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In his <em><a href="Cassius_Dio#Roman_History" title="wikilink">Roman History</a></em> (ca. 200 AD), <a href="Cassius_Dio" title="wikilink">Cassius Dio</a> adds: &quot;I call the people Dacians, the name used by the natives themselves as well as by the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a>, though I am not ignorant that some Greek writers refer to them as <em>Getae</em>, whether that is the right term or not...&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He also shows the Dacians to live on both sides of the Lower <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>; the ones south of the river (today's northern <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>), in <a href="Moesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moesia</a>, and are called <a href="Moesians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moesians</a>, while the ones north of the river are called Dacians.

<h3 id="modern-interpretations">Modern interpretations</h3>
<p>There is a dispute among scholars about the relations between the Getae and <a href="Dacians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dacians</a>, and this dispute also covers the interpretation of ancient sources. Some historians such as <a href="Ronald_Arthur_Crossland" title="wikilink">Ronald Arthur Crossland</a> state that even Ancient Greeks viewed the two designations &quot;interchangeable or with some confusion&quot;. Thus, it is generally considered that the two groups were related to a certain degree,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> while the exact relation is a matter of controversy.</p>

<p><a href="Romanians" title="wikilink">Romanian</a> scholars generally went further with the identification, historian <a href="Constantin_C._Giurescu" title="wikilink">Constantin C.

According to <a href="Glanville_Price" title="wikilink">Glanville Price</a>, the account of the Greek geographer <a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a> shows that the Getae and the Dacians were one and the same people.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Others who support the identity between Getae and Dacians with ancient sources include freelance writer <a href="James_Minahan" title="wikilink">James Minahan</a> and <a href="Catherine_B_Avery" title="wikilink">Catherine B Avery</a>, who claim the people whom the Greek called <em>Getae</em> were called <em>Daci</em> by the Romans.  The same view is expressed by some British historians such as <a href="Sandler_Berkowitz_David" title="wikilink">Sandler Berkowitz David</a> and <a href="Philip_Matyszak" title="wikilink">Philip Matyszak</a>. The Bulgarian historian and thracologist <a href="Alexander_Fol" title="wikilink">Alexander Fol</a> considers that the Getae became known as &quot;Dacians&quot; in Greek and Latin in the writings of <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Caesar</a>, Strabo and <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a>, as Roman observers adopted the name of the <a href="Dacian_tribe" title="wikilink">Dacian tribe</a> to refer to all the unconquered inhabitants north of the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>. Also, <a href="Sir_Edward_Bunbury,_9th_Baronet" title="wikilink">Edward Bunbury</a> believed the name of Getae, by which they were originally known to the Greeks on the <a href="Euxine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euxine</a>, was always retained by the latter in common usage: while that of Dacians, whatever be its origin, was that by which the more western tribes, adjoining the <a href="Pannonians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pannonians</a>, first became known to the Romans. Some scholars consider the Getae and Dacians to be the same people at different stages of their history and discuss their culture as <em>Geto-Dacian</em>.</p>
<h4 id="same-language-distinct-people">Same language, distinct people</h4>
<p>Historian and archaeologist <a href="Alexandru_Vulpe" title="wikilink">Alexandru Vulpe</a> found a remarkable uniformity of the Geto-Dacian culture,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> however he is one of the few Romanian archaeologists to make a clear distinction between the Getae and Dacians, arguing against the traditional position of the Romanian historiography that considered the two people the same.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Nevertheless, he chose to use the term &quot;Geto-Dacians&quot; as a conventional concept for the Thracian tribes inhabiting the future territory of Romania, not necessarily meaning an &quot;absolute ethnic, linguistic or historical unity&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Ronald Arthur Crossland suggested the two designations may refer to two groups of a &quot;linguistically homogeneous people&quot; that had come to historical prominence at two distinct periods of time. He also compared the probable linguistic situation with the relation between modern <a href="Norwegian_language" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> and <a href="Danish_language" title="wikilink">Danish</a> languages.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Paul_Lachlan_MacKendrick" title="wikilink">Paul Lachlan MacKendrick</a> considered the two as &quot;branches&quot; of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of a common language.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The Romanian <a href="History_of_ideas" title="wikilink">historian of ideas</a> and <a href="Historiography" title="wikilink">historiographer</a> <a href="Lucian_Boia" title="wikilink">Lucian Boia</a> stated: &quot;At a certain point, the phrase Geto-Dacian was coined in the Romanian historiography to suggest a unity of Getae and Dacians&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Lucian Boia took a sceptical position, arguing the ancient writers distinguished among the two people, treating them as two distinct groups of the Thracian ethnos.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Boia contended that it would be naive to assume Strabo knew the <a href="Thracian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thracian</a> dialects so well,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> alleging that Strabo had &quot;no competence in the field of Thracian dialects&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The latter claim is contested, some studies attesting Strabo's reliability and sources.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> There is no reason to disregard Strabo's view that the Daci and the Getae spoke the same language.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Boia also stressed that some Romanian authors cited Strabo indiscriminately.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>A similar position was adopted by Romanian historian and archaeologist <a href="G._A._Niculescu" title="wikilink">G. A.

<p>From the 7th century BC onwards, the Getae came into economic and cultural contact with the Greeks, who were establishing <a href="Colonies_in_antiquity" title="wikilink">colonies</a> on the western side of Pontus Euxinus, nowadays the Black Sea. The Getae are mentioned for the first time together in <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a> in his narrative of the Scythian campaign of <a href="Darius_I" title="wikilink">Darius I</a> in 513 BC. According to Herodotus, the Getae differed from other Thracian tribes in their religion, centered around the god (<em>daimon</em>) <a href="Zalmoxis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zalmoxis</a> whom some of the Getae called <a href="Gebeleizis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gebeleizis</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC, the Getae were mostly under the rule of the flourishing <a href="Odrysian_kingdom" title="wikilink">Odrysian kingdom</a>. During this time, the Getae provided military services and became famous for their cavalry. After the disintegration of the Odrysian kingdom, smaller Getic principalities began to consolidate themselves.</p>
<h3 id="persian-expedition">Persian expedition</h3>
<p>Before setting out on his <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persian</a> expedition, <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a> defeated the Getae and razed one of their settlements.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 313 BC, the Getae formed an alliance with <a href="Callatis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Callatis</a>, <a href="Varna" title="wikilink">Odessos</a>, and other western Pontic Greek colonies against <a href="Lysimachus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lysimachus</a>, who held a fortress at Tirizis (modern <a href="Kaliakra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaliakra</a>).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The Getae flourished especially in the first half of the 3rd century BC. By about 200 BC, the authority of the Getic prince, <a href="Zalmodegicus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zalmodegicus</a>, stretched as far as <a href="Histria_(ancient_city)" title="wikilink">Histria</a>, as a contemporary inscription shows.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Other strong princes included <a href="Zoltes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoltes</a> and <a href="Rhemaxos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhemaxos</a> (about 180 BC).

<h3 id="conflict-with-rome">Conflict with Rome</h3>
<p>In 72-71 BC, <a href="Marcus_Terentius_Varro_Lucullus" title="wikilink">Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus</a> became the first <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> commander to march against the Getae.

A decade later, a coalition of <a href="Scythians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scythians</a>, Getae, <a href="Bastarnae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bastarnae</a> and Greek colonists defeated C. <a href="Antonius_Hybrida" title="wikilink">Antonius Hybrida</a> at <a href="Histria_(Sinoe)" title="wikilink">Histria</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This victory over the Romans allowed <a href="Burebista" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burebista</a>, the leader of this coalition, to dominate the region for a short period (60-50 BC).</p>

<p>The <a href="Goths" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goths</a>, a <a href="Germanic_people" title="wikilink">Germanic people</a>, with their <em><a href="urheimat" class="uri" title="wikilink">urheimat</a></em> in <a href="G&lt;U+00F6&gt;taland" class="uri" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00F6&gt;taland</a> (Scandinavia) are usually equated with the Getae by Roman authors during the middle of the mid-to-late <a href="1st_millennium" title="wikilink">1st millennium</a>.</p>
<p>At the close of the 4th century AD, <a href="Claudian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Claudian</a>, court poet to the emperor <a href="Flavius_Augustus_Honorius" title="wikilink">Honorius</a> and the <a href="Patrician_(ancient_Rome)" title="wikilink">patrician</a> <a href="Stilicho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stilicho</a>, uses the ethnonym <em>Getae</em> to refer to the <a href="Visigoths" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visigoths</a>.</p>
<p>During 5th and 6th centuries, several historians and ethnographers (<a href="Marcellinus_Comes" title="wikilink">Marcellinus Comes</a>, <a href="Paulus_Orosius" title="wikilink">Orosius</a>, <a href="John_Lydus" title="wikilink">John Lydus</a>, <a href="Isidore_of_Seville" title="wikilink">Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="Procopius_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Procopius of Caesarea</a>) used the same ethnonym <em>Getae</em> to name populations invading the <a href="Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Eastern Roman Empire</a> (<a href="Goths" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goths</a>, <a href="Gepids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gepids</a>, <a href="Kutrigurs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kutrigurs</a>, <a href="Slavs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavs</a>). For instance, in the third book of the <a href="s:History_of_the_Wars/Book_III" title="wikilink">History of the Wars</a> <a href="Procopius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procopius</a> details: &quot;There were many Gothic nations in earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepaedes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatae and Melanchlaeni; and there were some too who called these nations Getic.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The Getae were also assumed to be the ancestors of the Goths by <a href="Jordanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordanes</a> in his <em><a href="The_Origin_and_Deeds_of_the_Goths" title="wikilink">Getica</a></em> written at the middle of the 6th century.

<li id="fn1"> In chapter &quot;20c Linguistic problems of the Balkan area&quot;, at page 838, Ronald Arthur Crossland argues &quot;it may be the distinction made by Greeks and Romans between the Getae and Daci, for example, reflected the importance of different sections of a linguistically homogenous people at different times&quot;.

Terrible to them also was the closely locked order of the phalanx, and violent the charge of the cavalry. At first they fled for refuge into their city, which. was distant about a parasang from the Ister; but when they saw that Alexander was leading his phalanx carefully along the side of the river, to prevent his infantry being anywhere surrounded by the Getae lying in ambush, but that he was sending his cavalry straight on, they again abandoned the city, because it was badly fortified.&quot;<a href="#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
