<p>James achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> including the <a href="Gunpowder_Plot" title="wikilink">Gunpowder Plot</a> in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">English Parliament</a>. According to a tradition originating with historians of the mid-seventeenth-century, James's taste for <a href="political_absolutism" title="wikilink">political absolutism</a>, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular <a href="favourite" title="wikilink">favourites</a> established the foundation for the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Recent historians, however, have revised James's reputation and treated him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Under James, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of <a href="Elizabethan_era" title="wikilink">Elizabethan</a> literature and drama continued, with writers such as <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="John_Donne" title="wikilink">John Donne</a>, <a href="Ben_Jonson" title="wikilink">Ben Jonson</a>, and <a href="Francis_Bacon" title="wikilink">Sir Francis Bacon</a> contributing to a flourishing literary culture.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> James himself was a talented <a href="scholar" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholar</a>, the author of works such as <em><a href="Daemonologie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daemonologie</a></em> (1597)<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and <em><a href="Basilikon_Doron" title="wikilink">Basilikon Doron</a></em> (1599).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Anthony_Weldon" title="wikilink">Sir Anthony Weldon</a> claimed that James had been termed &quot;the wisest fool in Christendom&quot;, an epithet associated with his character ever since.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><em>James Charles</em> was the only child of <a href="Mary_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> and her second husband, <a href="Henry_Stuart,_Lord_Darnley" title="wikilink">Henry Stuart, Duke of Albany</a>, commonly known as Lord Darnley. He was a descendant of <a href="Henry_VII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VII</a> through his great-grandmother <a href="Margaret_Tudor" title="wikilink">Margaret Tudor</a>, elder sister of <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Mary's rule over Scotland was insecure, for both she and her husband, being <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church_in_Scotland" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a>, faced a rebellion by <a href="Protestantism" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> noblemen. Their marriage was a particularly difficult one.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> While Mary was pregnant with James, Lord Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and murdered the Queen's private secretary, <a href="David_Rizzio" title="wikilink">David Rizzio</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>James was born on <a href="19_June" title="wikilink">19 June</a> <a href="1566" class="uri" title="wikilink">1566</a> at <a href="Edinburgh_Castle" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Castle</a>, and as the eldest son of the monarch and heir-apparent, automatically became <a href="Duke_of_Rothesay" title="wikilink">Duke of Rothesay</a> and <a href="Lord_High_Steward#High_Stewards_of_Scotland,_ca.1150-present" title="wikilink">Prince and Great Steward of Scotland</a>.

<p>James's father Henry was murdered on <a href="10_February" title="wikilink">10 February</a> <a href="1567" class="uri" title="wikilink">1567</a> at the Hamiltons' house, <a href="Kirk_o&#39;_Field" title="wikilink">Kirk o' Field</a>, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for Rizzio's death.

<p>The care of James was entrusted to the <a href="John_Erskine,_17th_Earl_of_Mar" title="wikilink">Earl</a> and Countess of Mar, &quot;to be conserved, nursed, and upbrought&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> in the security of <a href="Stirling_Castle" title="wikilink">Stirling Castle</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The boy was formally crowned at the age of thirteen months as King James VI of Scotland at <a href="the_Church_of_the_Holy_Rude,_Stirling" title="wikilink">the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling</a>, on <a href="19_July" title="wikilink">19 July</a> <a href="1567" class="uri" title="wikilink">1567</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The sermon was preached by the Geneva <a href="Calvinist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calvinist</a> <a href="John_Knox" title="wikilink">John Knox</a>.

<p>In 1568, Mary escaped from prison, leading to a brief period of violence. The <a href="James_Stewart,_1st_Earl_of_Moray" title="wikilink">Earl of Moray</a> defeated Mary's troops at the <a href="Battle_of_Langside" title="wikilink">Battle of Langside</a>, forcing her to flee to England, where she was subsequently imprisoned by Elizabeth. On <a href="22_January" title="wikilink">22 January</a> <a href="1570" class="uri" title="wikilink">1570</a>, Moray was <a href="assassination" title="wikilink">assassinated</a> by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, to be succeeded as regent by James's paternal grandfather, <a href="Matthew_Stewart,_4th_Earl_of_Lennox" title="wikilink">Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox</a>, who a year later was carried fatally wounded into Stirling Castle after a raid by Mary's supporters.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The next regent, <a href="John_Erskine,_1st_Earl_of_Mar" title="wikilink">John Erskine, 1st Earl of Mar</a>, died soon after banqueting at the estate of <a href="James_Douglas,_4th_Earl_of_Morton" title="wikilink">James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton</a>, where he &quot;took a vehement sickness&quot;, dying on <a href="28_October" title="wikilink">28 October</a> <a href="1572" class="uri" title="wikilink">1572</a> at Stirling. Morton, who now took Mar's office, proved in many ways the most effective of James's regents,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> but he made enemies by his rapacity.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He fell from favour when the Frenchman <a href="Esm&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Stewart,_1st_Duke_of_Lennox" title="wikilink">Esm&lt;U+00E9&gt; Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny</a>, first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley, and future <a href="Earl_of_Lennox" title="wikilink">Earl of Lennox</a>, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful male favourites.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Morton was executed on <a href="2_June" title="wikilink">2 June</a> <a href="1581" class="uri" title="wikilink">1581</a>, belatedly charged with complicity in Lord Darnley's murder.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Then fifteen years old, the king was to remain under the influence of Lennox for about one more year.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-rule-in-scotland">Personal rule in Scotland</h2>
<p>Although a Protestant convert, Lennox was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists, who noticed the physical displays of affection between favourite and king and alleged that Lennox &quot;went about to draw the King to carnal lust&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In August 1582, in what became known as the <a href="Raid_of_Ruthven" title="wikilink">Ruthven Raid</a>, the Protestant earls of <a href="William_Ruthven,_1st_Earl_of_Gowrie" title="wikilink">Gowrie</a> and <a href="Archibald_Douglas,_8th_Earl_of_Angus" title="wikilink">Angus</a> lured James into <a href="Huntingtower_Castle" title="wikilink">Ruthven Castle</a>, imprisoned him,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. After James was freed in June 1583, he assumed increasing control of his monarchy. He pushed through the <a href="Black_Acts" title="wikilink">Black Acts</a> to assert royal authority over the <a href="Kirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kirk</a> and between 1584 and 1603 established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords, ably assisted by <a href="John_Maitland,_1st_Lord_Maitland_of_Thirlestane" title="wikilink">John Maitland of Thirlestane</a>, who led the government until 1592.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> One last Scottish attempt against the king's person occurred in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by <a href="Alexander_Ruthven" title="wikilink">Alexander Ruthven</a>, the <a href="John_Ruthven,_3rd_Earl_of_Gowrie" title="wikilink">Earl of Gowrie</a>'s younger brother, at Gowrie House, the seat of the Ruthvens.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Since Ruthven was run through by James's page <a href="John_Ramsay,_1st_Earl_of_Holderness" title="wikilink">John Ramsay</a> and the <a href="John_Ruthven,_3rd_Earl_of_Gowrie" title="wikilink">Earl of Gowrie</a> was himself killed in the ensuing fracas, James's account of the circumstances, given the lack of witnesses and his history with the Ruthvens, was not universally believed.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1586, James signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Berwick_(1586)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Berwick</a> with England; and the execution of his mother in 1587, which he denounced as a &quot;preposterous and strange procedure&quot;, helped clear the way for his succession south of the border.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> During the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Spanish Armada</a> crisis of 1588, he assured Elizabeth of his support as &quot;your natural son and compatriot of your country&quot;;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and as time passed and Elizabeth remained unmarried, securing the English succession became a cornerstone of James's policy.</p>

<p>Throughout his youth, James was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women; and after the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his monarchy, and the choice fell on the fourteen-year-old <a href="Anne_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Anne of Denmark</a> (born December 1574), younger daughter of the Protestant <a href="Frederick_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick II</a>. Shortly after a proxy marriage in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing the crossing had been abandoned, James, in what Willson calls &quot;the one romantic episode of his life&quot;,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The couple were married formally at the <a href="Old_Bishop&#39;s_Palace_in_Oslo" title="wikilink">Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo</a> on 23 November and, after stays at <a href="Elsinore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elsinore</a> and <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>, returned to Scotland in May 1590. By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne, and in the early years of their marriage seems always to have showed her patience and affection.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> But between 1593 and 1595, James was romantically linked with Anne Murray, later Lady Glamis, whom he addressed in verse as &quot;my mistress and my love&quot;. The royal couple produced three surviving children: <a href="Henry_Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Henry, Prince of Wales</a>, who was to die, probably of <a href="typhoid" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhoid</a>, in 1612, aged 18; <a href="Elizabeth_Stuart" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a>, later Queen of <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a>; and Charles, the future King <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I of England</a>. Anne predeceased her husband in March 1619.</p>
<h3 id="theory-of-monarchy">Theory of monarchy</h3>
<p>In 1597&lt;U+2013&gt;8, James wrote two works, <em><a href="The_Trew_Law_of_Free_Monarchies" title="wikilink">The Trew Law of Free Monarchies</a></em> and <em><a href="Basilikon_Doron" title="wikilink">Basilikon Doron</a></em> (Royal Gift), in which he established an ideological base for monarchy. In the <em>Trew Law</em>, he sets out the <a href="divine_right_of_kings" title="wikilink">divine right of kings</a>, explaining that for Biblical reasons kings are higher beings than other men, though &quot;the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by <a href="royal_prerogative" title="wikilink">royal prerogative</a> but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would &quot;stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <em>Basilikon Doron</em>, written as a book of instruction for the four-year-old <a href="Henry_Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Prince Henry</a>, provides a more practical guide to kingship.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Despite banalities and sanctimonious advice,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> the work is well-written, perhaps the best example of James's prose.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> James's advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king's &quot;head court&quot;, foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons: &quot;Hold no Parliaments,&quot; he tells Henry, &quot;but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In the <em>Trew Law</em> James states that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Kings arose] before any estates or ranks of men, before any parliaments were holden, or laws made, and by them was the land distributed, which at first was wholly theirs. And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth I's life, certain English politicians, notably her chief minister <a href="Robert_Cecil,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Cecil</a>,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> maintained a secret correspondence with James in order to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. In March 1603, with the old Queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March; and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> As James headed south, his new subjects flocked to see him, relieved above all that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> When he entered London, he was mobbed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> James's English coronation took place on 25 July, with elaborate allegories provided by dramatic poets such as <a href="Thomas_Dekker" title="wikilink">Thomas Dekker</a> and <a href="Ben_Jonson" title="wikilink">Ben Jonson</a>, though an outbreak of the plague restricted festivities.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-reign-in-england">Early reign in England</h2>
<p>Despite the smoothness of the succession and the warmth of his welcome, James survived two conspiracies in the first year of his reign, the <a href="Bye_Plot" title="wikilink">Bye Plot</a> and <a href="Main_Plot" title="wikilink">Main Plot</a>, which led to the arrest, among others, of <a href="Henry_Brooke,_11th_Baron_Cobham" title="wikilink">Lord Cobham</a> and <a href="Sir_Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Raleigh</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Those hoping for governmental change from James were at first disappointed when he maintained Elizabeth's <a href="Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Councillors</a> in office, as secretly planned with Cecil,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> but James shortly added long-time supporter <a href="Henry_Howard,_1st_Earl_of_Northampton" title="wikilink">Henry Howard</a> and his nephew <a href="Thomas_Howard,_1st_Earl_of_Suffolk" title="wikilink">Thomas Howard</a> to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In the early years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the government was tightly managed by the shrewd Robert Cecil, later <a href="earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">earl of Salisbury</a>, ably assisted by the experienced <a href="Thomas_Egerton,_1st_Viscount_Brackley" title="wikilink">Thomas Egerton</a>, whom James made Baron Ellesmere and <a href="Lord_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Lord Chancellor</a>, and by <a href="Thomas_Sackville,_1st_Earl_of_Dorset" title="wikilink">Thomas Sackville</a>, soon <a href="earl_of_Dorset" title="wikilink">earl of Dorset</a>, who continued as <a href="Lord_Treasurer" title="wikilink">Lord Treasurer</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on the bigger issues, such as a scheme for a closer union between England and Scotland and foreign-policy issues, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly the hunt.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>James was ambitious to build on the personal union of the crowns of Scotland and England to establish a permanent <a href="Union_of_the_Crowns" title="wikilink">Union of the Crowns</a> under one monarch, one parliament and one law, a plan which met opposition in both countries.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> &quot;Hath He not made us all in one island,&quot; James told the English parliament, &quot;compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?&quot; In April 1604, however, the Commons refused on legal grounds his request to be titled &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In October 1604, he assumed the title &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; by proclamation rather than statute, though <a href="Francis_Bacon" title="wikilink">Sir Francis Bacon</a> told him he could not use the style in &quot;any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In foreign policy, James achieved more success. Never having been at war with Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long <a href="Anglo&lt;U+2013&gt;Spanish_War_(1585)" title="wikilink">Armada war</a> to an end, and in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now <a href="earl_of_Northampton" title="wikilink">earl of Northampton</a>, a peace treaty was signed between the countries, which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Freedom of worship for Catholics in England continued, however, to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics and at home for tolerance towards them.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>On the eve of the <a href="State_Opening_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">state opening</a> of the second session of James's first Parliament on 5 November 1605, a soldier named <a href="Guy_Fawkes" title="wikilink">Guy Fawkes</a> was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings guarding a pile of <a href="Faggot_(wood)" title="wikilink">faggots</a>, not far from about twenty barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, &quot;not only...of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The sensational discovery of the Catholic <a href="Gunpowder_Plot" title="wikilink">Gunpowder Plot</a>, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons which Salisbury exploited to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="king-and-parliament">King and Parliament</h2>

<p>The moment of co-operation between monarch and Parliament following the Gunpowder plot represented a deviation from the norm. Instead, it was the previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> On <a href="7_July" title="wikilink">7 July</a> <a href="1604" class="uri" title="wikilink">1604</a>, James had angrily <a href="Parliamentary_session" title="wikilink">prorogued</a> Parliament after failing to win its support either for full <a href="union_of_the_crowns" title="wikilink">union of the crowns</a> or financial subsidies. &quot;I will not thank where I feel no thanks due,&quot; he had remarked in his closing speech. &quot;...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools...You see how many things you did not well...I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>As James's reign progressed, his government faced growing financial pressures, due partly to creeping inflation<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> but also to the profligacy and financial incompetence of James's court. In February 1610 Salisbury, a believer in parliamentary participation in government,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> proposed a scheme, known as the <a href="Great_Contract" title="wikilink">Great Contract</a>, whereby Parliament, in return for ten royal concessions, would grant a lump sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;600,000 to pay off the king's debts plus an annual grant of &lt;U+00A3&gt;200,000.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on <a href="31_December" title="wikilink">31 December</a> <a href="1610" class="uri" title="wikilink">1610</a>. &quot;Your greatest error,&quot; he told Salisbury, &quot;hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The same pattern was repeated with the so-called &quot;<a href="Addled_Parliament" title="wikilink">Addled Parliament</a>&quot; of 1614, which James dissolved after a mere eight weeks when Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> James then ruled without parliament until 1621, employing officials such as the businessman <a href="Lionel_Cranfield,_1st_Earl_of_Middlesex" title="wikilink">Lionel Cranfield</a>, who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown, and sold earldoms and other dignities, many created for the purpose, as an alternative source of income.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>Another potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> and the <a href="Maria_Anna_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish Infanta, Maria</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The policy of the <a href="Spanish_Match" title="wikilink">Spanish Match</a>, as it was called, also attracted James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The peace benefits of the policy could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match&lt;U+2014&gt;which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats&lt;U+2014&gt;together known as the Spanish Party&lt;U+2014&gt;the policy was deeply distrusted in Protestant England.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the <a href="Thirty_Years_War" title="wikilink">Thirty Years War</a>, however, jeopardized James's peace policy, especially after his son-in-law, <a href="Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine" title="wikilink">Frederick V, Elector Palatine</a>, was ousted from <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a> by <a href="Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Emperor Ferdinand II</a> in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's <a href="Rhineland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhineland</a> home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> and on the other&lt;U+2014&gt;remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on gold shipments from the New World&lt;U+2014&gt;called for a war directly against Spain.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In November 1621, led by <a href="Edward_Coke" title="wikilink">Sir Edward Coke</a>, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of <a href="royal_prerogative" title="wikilink">royal prerogative</a> or they would risk punishment,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament once again.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1623, Prince Charles, now 23, and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> to win the Infanta directly, but the mission proved a desperate mistake.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The Spanish overreached, confronting them with terms that included Charles' conversion to Catholicism and a one-year stay in Spain as, in essence, a diplomatic hostage, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the Infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much to the delight of the British people.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Their eyes opened by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James&lt;U+2019&gt;s Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Hapsburg empire.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1623. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of the <a href="Lord_Treasurer" title="wikilink">Lord Treasurer</a>, <a href="Lionel_Cranfield" title="wikilink">Cranfield</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Middlesex" title="wikilink">Earl of Middlesex</a>, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to financing a war against Spain, a stance which was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religious-challenges">Religious challenges</h2>

<p>The Gunpowder Plot forced James to reconsider his tolerant policy towards English Catholics; and for a while he sanctioned stricter measures to control them. In May 1606, Parliament passed an act which could require any citizen to take an Oath of Allegiance, incorporating a denial of the pope's authority over the king.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> In practice, James proved lenient towards Catholic laymen who took the Oath of Allegiance,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and he tolerated Catholicism and crypto-Catholicism even at court.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Towards the <a href="Puritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritan</a> clergy, with whom he debated at the <a href="Hampton_Court_Conference" title="wikilink">Hampton Court Conference</a> of 1604,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> James was at first strict in enforcing conformity, inducing a sense of persecution amongst many Puritans;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> but ejections and suspensions from livings became fewer as the reign wore on. A notable success of the Hampton Court Conference was the commissioning of a new translation of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, completed in 1611, which became known as the <a href="King_James_Version_of_the_Bible" title="wikilink">King James Bible</a>, considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In Scotland, James attempted to bring the Scottish kirk &quot;so neir as can be&quot; to the English church and reestablish the episcopacy, a policy which met with strong opposition.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In 1618, James's bishops forced his <a href="Five_Articles_of_Perth" title="wikilink">Five Articles of Perth</a> through a General Assembly; but the rulings were widely resisted.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> James was to leave the church in Scotland divided at his death, a source of future problems for his son.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="personal-relationships">Personal relationships</h2>

<p>Throughout his life James had close relationships with male <a href="courtier" title="wikilink">courtiers</a>, in particular <a href="Esm&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Stewart,_1st_Duke_of_Lennox" title="wikilink">Esm&lt;U+00E9&gt; Stewart, 6th Lord d'Aubigny</a> (later 1st Duke of Lennox); <a href="Robert_Carr,_1st_Earl_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset</a>; and <a href="George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham" title="wikilink">George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham</a>. There has been debate among historians about the nature of these relationships: &quot;The evidence of his correspondence and contemporary accounts have led some historians to conclude that the king was homosexual or bisexual.

(Barroll and Cerasano, 1996)<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Furthermore, it was standard practice at the time that the king did not sleep alone, but had the security and companionship of members of the royal bedchamber (see <a href="gentleman_of_the_bedchamber" title="wikilink">gentleman of the bedchamber</a>).

<p>During the last year of James' life, with Buckingham consolidating his control of Charles to ensure his own future, the king was often seriously ill, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In early 1625, James was plagued by severe attacks of <a href="arthritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">arthritis</a>, <a href="gout" class="uri" title="wikilink">gout</a> and fainting fits, and in March fell seriously ill with tertian <a href="wikt:ague" title="wikilink">ague</a> and then suffered a <a href="stroke" class="uri" title="wikilink">stroke</a>.

Indeed, almost two years later, in September 1615, and as James was in the process of replacing Rochester with a new favourite, George Villiers, the Governor of the Tower of London sent a letter to the king informing him that one of the warders in the days before Overbury had been found dead had been bringing the prisoner poisoned food and medicine.&quot; Barroll, <em>Anna of Denmark</em>, p 136.<a href="#fnref103" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn109">Some historians (for example Willson, p 425) consider James, who was 58 in 1624, to have lapsed into premature senility; but he suffered from, among other ailments, an agonising species of arthritis which constantly left him indisposed; and Pauline Croft suggests that in summer 1624, afforded relief by the warm weather, James regained some control over his affairs, his continuing refusal to sanction war against Spain a deliberate stand against the aggressive policies of Charles and Buckingham (Croft, pp 126&lt;U+2013&gt;127); &quot;James never became a cypher.&quot; Croft, p 101.<a href="#fnref109" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
