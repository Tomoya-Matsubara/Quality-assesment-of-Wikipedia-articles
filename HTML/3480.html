<p><strong>Basil Wolverton</strong> (July 9, 1909 – December 31, 1978) was an <a href="People_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> cartoonist, illustrator, <a href="Comic_book_creator" title="wikilink">comic book writer-artist</a> and professed &quot;Producer of Preposterous Pictures of Peculiar People who Prowl this Perplexing Planet&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose many publishers included <a href="Marvel_Comics" title="wikilink">Marvel Comics</a> and <em><a href="Mad_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Mad</a></em>.</p>
<p>His unique, humorously grotesque drawings have elicited a wide range of reactions. Cartoonist <a href="Will_Elder" title="wikilink">Will Elder</a> said he found Wolverton's technique &quot;outrageously inventive, defying every conventional standard yet upholding a very unusual sense of humor. He was a refreshing original,&quot; while <a href="Jules_Feiffer" title="wikilink">Jules Feiffer</a> stated, &quot;I don't like his work. I think it's ugly&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's <a href="List_of_Harvey_Award_winners#The_Jack_Kirby_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Jack Kirby Hall of Fame</a> in 1991.</p>

<h3 id="early-life-and-career">Early life and career</h3>
<p>Born in <a href="Central_Point,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Central Point</a>, <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>, he later moved to <a href="Vancouver,_Washington" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a>, <a href="Washington_(state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, and worked as a <a href="vaudeville" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaudeville</a> performer and a cartoonist and reporter for the <em>Portland News</em>. At age 16 he sold his first nationally published work and began pitching comic strips to newspaper syndicates. His <a href="comic_strip" title="wikilink">comic strip</a>, <em>Marco of Mars,</em> was accepted by the Independent Syndicate of New York in 1929 but never distributed because it was deemed too similar to <em><a href="Buck_Rogers" title="wikilink">Buck Rogers</a>,</em> which debuted that year.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Disk-Eyes the Detective</em> and <em>Spacehawks</em> were published in 1938 in <em>Circus</em> comics. In 1940, <em>Spacehawk</em> (a different and improved feature) made its debut in <em>Target Comics</em> (<a href="Novelty_Press" title="wikilink">Novelty Press</a>), running for 30 episodes (262 pages) until 1942.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="powerhouse-pepper-and-lena-the-hyena">Powerhouse Pepper and Lena the Hyena</h3>
<p>Wolverton's <a href="humor" class="uri" title="wikilink">humor</a> feature <em><a href="Powerhouse_Pepper" title="wikilink">Powerhouse Pepper</a></em>, about a superstrong if none-too-bright <a href="boxing" title="wikilink">boxer</a>, appeared in various comic books published by <a href="Timely_Comics" title="wikilink">Timely Comics</a>, the 1930s and 1940s precursor of <a href="Marvel_Comics" title="wikilink">Marvel Comics</a>, from 1942 through 1952 (76 episodes, 539 pages). Admirers consider that series a high-water mark of humorous comics, with its alliterative, rhyming dialogue, screwball comedy, and throwaway gags in background signs.</p>
<p><img src="Lenahyena.png" title="fig:L&#39;il Abner daily strip by Al Capp, introducing Basil Wolverton&#39;s &quot;Lena Hyena&quot;" alt="L&#39;il Abner daily strip by Al Capp, introducing Basil Wolverton&#39;s &quot;Lena Hyena&quot;" width="480" /> In 1946 Wolverton won a contest to depict &quot;Lena Hyena&quot;, the world's ugliest woman, a running gag in <a href="Al_Capp" title="wikilink">Al Capp</a>'s <em><a href="Li&#39;l_Abner" title="wikilink">Li'l Abner</a></em> newspaper strip where <em>Lena</em> remained unseen beneath an editorial note stating her face had been covered to protect readers. Capp, responding to popular demand, announced a contest for artists to submit their interpretations to be judged by <a href="Boris_Karloff" title="wikilink">Boris Karloff</a>, <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a> and <a href="Salvador_Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt;" title="wikilink">Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt;</a>. Among 500,000 entries, Wolverton's was the winner; it appeared in a <em>Li'l Abner</em> daily and <em><a href="Life_magazine" title="wikilink">Life</a></em> magazine. Wolverton's fame briefly lead to <em>Life</em> and <em><a href="Pageant_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Pageant</a></em> printing his caricatures. The <em>Lena</em> portrait typified the unique &quot;spaghetti and meatballs&quot; style he employed regularly thereafter.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, Wolverton produced 17 comic-book <a href="horror_fiction" title="wikilink">horror</a> and <a href="science-fiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">science-fiction</a> stories for Marvel and other comic-book publishers, including one story by author <a href="Daniel_Keyes" title="wikilink">Daniel Keyes</a>, which led to him being &quot;hailed for creating uniquely grotesque monsters&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mad"><em>Mad</em></h3>
<p>Wolverton first appeared in <em><a href="Mad_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Mad</a></em> with a single panel in #10, drew <em>Mad Reader!</em> for #11 and also contributed an iconic Lena-like image to the cover of #11, which was billed as the &quot;Beautiful Girl of the Month&quot;. Mocking the glossy cover images of <em><a href="Life_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Life Magazine</a></em>, Wolverton's hag was <em>Mad</em>'s first magazine parody cover image. Although Wolverton contributed sporadically to the title&lt;U+2014&gt;appearing in just nine issues over two decades&lt;U+2014&gt;his work was memorable enough that, in 2009, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> dubbed him &quot;The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1956, Wolverton illustrated Herbert Armstrong's apocalyptic booklet <em>1975 in Prophecy</em> and later, <em>The Book of Revelation Unveiled at Last</em>, offered free on Armstrong's radio show <em><a href="The_World_Tomorrow" title="wikilink">The World Tomorrow</a>.</em> In 1958, Wolverton began writing and illustrating <em>The Bible Story,</em> also titled <em>The Story of Man,</em> covering the entire history of the Old Testament, serialized in <em><a href="The_Plain_Truth" title="wikilink">The Plain Truth</a></em> and later published in six volumes.</p>
<h3 id="later-career">Later career</h3>
<p>In 1968 Wolverton did a series of posters for <a href="Topps" class="uri" title="wikilink">Topps</a>, displaying his trademark twisted headshots, and in 1973 he returned to mainstream comics, illustrating several covers for <a href="Joe_Orlando" title="wikilink">Joe Orlando</a>'s satiric <em><a href="Plop!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plop!</a></em> at <a href="DC_Comics" title="wikilink">DC Comics</a>. His return was cut short by a <a href="Cerebrovascular_accident" title="wikilink">stroke</a> in 1974. He died in Vancouver, Washington, four years later.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Wolverton was baptized into <a href="Herbert_W._Armstrong" title="wikilink">Herbert W. Armstrong's</a> <a href="Radio_Church_of_God" title="wikilink">Radio Church of God</a> in 1941 and was <a href="ordination" title="wikilink">ordained</a> as an <a href="elder_(religious)" title="wikilink">elder</a> in 1943. As a board member of that church, he was one of the six people, including Armstrong and his wife, who re-incorporated the church in 1946 when it moved its original headquarters from Oregon to <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>.</p>
<p>Wolverton's son, editorial cartoonist <a href="Monte_Wolverton" title="wikilink">Monte Wolverton</a>, draws in a style similar to his father's; the younger Wolverton also worked for <em>The Plain Truth</em> and contributed to <em>Mad</em>. Several cartoonists have been influenced by Wolverton's &quot;spaghetti-and-meatball&quot; style, including the hotrod stalwart <a href="Ed_&quot;Big_Daddy&quot;_Roth" title="wikilink">Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth</a>.</p>
