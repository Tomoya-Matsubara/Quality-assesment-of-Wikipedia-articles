<p>The <a href="Australia_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australian cricket team</a> toured the West Indies in the 1977-78 season to play a five-match <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test</a> series against the <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies</a>. The tour also encompassed a pair of One Day Internationals, plus six tour matches against the <a href="Cricket_in_the_West_Indies" title="wikilink">West Indies'</a> <a href="first_class_cricket" title="wikilink">first class</a> sides.</p>
<p>The West Indies won the test series 3-1 with one match drawn. The West Indies therefore regained the Sir <a href="Frank_Worrell_Trophy" title="wikilink">Frank Worrell Trophy</a> which had been lost <a href="West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69" title="wikilink">in 1968</a>. They would hold this trophy against Australia until <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_West_Indies_in_1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95#Australia_1994-95" title="wikilink">1995</a>.</p>
<h2 id="australian-squad">Australian squad</h2>
<p>Australia had just <a href="Indian_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1977&lt;U+2013&gt;78" title="wikilink">defeated India</a> 3-2 at home during the 1977-78 season; however, the team was rebuilding in the wake of defections of players to <a href="World_Series_Cricket" title="wikilink">World Series Cricket</a>. Most of these players were available for selection but the furore had led the <a href="Australian_Cricket_Board" title="wikilink">Australian Cricket Board</a> refusing to consider those players that had signed up to play in WSC for selection to the national side.</p>
<p>The original squad selected were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batsmen - <a href="Bob_Simpson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bob Simpson</a> (captain), <a href="Graham_Yallop" title="wikilink">Graham Yallop</a>, <a href="Peter_Toohey" title="wikilink">Peter Toohey</a>, <a href="Rick_Darling" title="wikilink">Rick Darling</a>, <a href="Graeme_Wood" title="wikilink">Graeme Wood</a>, <a href="Craig_Serjeant" title="wikilink">Craig Serjeant</a>, <a href="Kim_Hughes" title="wikilink">Kim Hughes</a>, <a href="Gary_Cosier" title="wikilink">Gary Cosier</a></li>
<li>Fastbowlers - <a href="Jeff_Thomson" title="wikilink">Jeff Thomson</a> (vice captain), <a href="Wayne_Clark_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Wayne Clark</a>, <a href="Ian_Callen" title="wikilink">Ian Callen</a></li>
<li>Spinners - <a href="Bruce_Yardley" title="wikilink">Bruce Yardley</a>, <a href="Jim_Higgs" title="wikilink">Jim Higgs</a></li>
<li>All rounder - <a href="Trevor_Laughlin" title="wikilink">Trevor Laughlin</a></li>
<li>Wicketkeeper - <a href="Steve_Rixon" title="wikilink">Steve Rixon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The furore over <a href="World_Series_Cricket" title="wikilink">World Series Cricket</a> had led the <a href="Australian_Cricket_Board" title="wikilink">ACB</a> to refuse to consider for selection to the national team any Australian player that had signed up to WSC. The <a href="West_Indies_Cricket_Board" title="wikilink">West Indies Cricket Board</a> took a different view, and chose a number of their players from those signed to the <a href="Kerry_Packer" title="wikilink">Kerry Packer</a> organisation for the first two games. This led to the West Indies easily beating the tourists to take a 2-0 lead in the series. However, in the lead up to the 3rd Test in <a href="Guyana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guyana</a>, the WICB made a decision to leave out three of their WSC contracted players, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the West Indies' tour to <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a> later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of <a href="Clive_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Clive Lloyd</a> as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Australia won the 3rd test, but lost the 4th. Australia were on track to win the 5th test but the crowd rioted and the game had to be called off early.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
