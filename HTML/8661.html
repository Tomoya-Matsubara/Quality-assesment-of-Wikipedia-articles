<p>In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university system would better serve the needs of the region.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> When the members of the committee visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for the idea of hosting the institution.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including <a href="Floydada,_Texas" title="wikilink">Floydada</a>, <a href="Plainview,_Texas" title="wikilink">Plainview</a>, and <a href="Sweetwater,_Texas" title="wikilink">Sweetwater</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years.

<h3 id="mascots">Mascots</h3>
<p><img src="Raiderred.png" title="fig:Raider Red cartoon by Dirk West" alt="Raider Red cartoon by Dirk West" /> <a href="The_Masked_Rider" title="wikilink">The Masked Rider</a> is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field Starting at the beginning of home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the <a href="Gator_Bowl" title="wikilink">Gator Bowl</a>. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the <em><a href="Atlanta_Journal" title="wikilink">Atlanta Journal</a></em> who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Today the Masked Rider, with <a href="guns_up" title="wikilink">guns up</a>, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive <a href="gaucho" class="uri" title="wikilink">gaucho</a> hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Ashley Hartzog, a senior animal science and Spanish major from <a href="Farwell,_Texas" title="wikilink">Farwell, Texas</a>, will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2008/09.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="MRlogo.png" title="fig:The Masked Rider logo" alt="The Masked Rider logo" /> Texas Tech's other mascot, <a href="Raider_Red" title="wikilink">Raider Red</a>, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the <a href="Saddle_Tramps" title="wikilink">Saddle Tramps</a> student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist <a href="Dirk_West" title="wikilink">Dirk West</a>, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or <a href="High_Riders" title="wikilink">High Riders</a>. {{-}}</p>

<h3 id="double-t-spirit-logo">Double T spirit logo</h3>
<p><img src="Texas-Tech-University-logo.png" title="fig:Double T spirit logo" alt="Double T spirit logo" /> The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T logo. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, <a href="E._Y._Freeland" title="wikilink">E. Y. Freeland</a>, was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim.</p>
<p>To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T <a href="neon_sign" title="wikilink">neon sign</a>, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="texas-tech-ring">Texas Tech ring</h3>
<p><img src="Techring.png" title="fig:Texas Tech alumni ring" alt="Texas Tech alumni ring" /> While the <a href="class_ring" title="wikilink">class ring</a> had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school&lt;U+2019&gt;s full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.</p>
<p>One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="will-rogers-and-soapsuds">Will Rogers and Soapsuds</h3>
<p>One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of <a href="Will_Rogers" title="wikilink">Will Rogers</a> on his horse Soapsuds. The statue has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950 by Rogers' longtime friend <a href="Amon_G._Carter" title="wikilink">Amon G. Carter</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of <a href="West_Texas" title="wikilink">West Texas</a>.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> The statue, estimated to cost (in 1950) $25,000, stands 9 feet 11 inches (3 m) and weighs 3,200 <a href="pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">pounds</a> (1,450 kg).<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: &quot;Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.&quot;<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Wrstatue.jpg" title="fig:Will Rogers and Soapsuds" alt="Will Rogers and Soapsuds" /> According to one legend, the statue was originally to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, towards the main entrance of the school. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. To solve this problem, the statue was turned 23 <a href="degree_(angle)" title="wikilink">degrees</a> to the northwest so Soapsuds' rear would face southeast in the general direction of <a href="College_Station,_Texas" title="wikilink">College Station, Texas</a>, home of rival Texas A&amp;M University. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap the statue with red crepe paper. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crepe paper.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
