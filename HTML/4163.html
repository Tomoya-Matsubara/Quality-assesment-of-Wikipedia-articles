<p>Anthony Erwin Randolph, Jr. was born to Anthony and Crystal Randolph in <a href="Wurzbach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wurzbach</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, where both of his parents served in the <a href="military" class="uri" title="wikilink">military</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Randolph spent the first year of his life in Germany before his family moved to <a href="Pasadena,_California" title="wikilink">Pasadena, California</a>, where he spent the majority of his childhood.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Randolph attended schools in Pasadena as well as <a href="Little_Rock,_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Little Rock, Arkansas</a> before heading to <a href="Woodrow_Wilson_High_School_(Dallas,_Texas)" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson High School</a> in <a href="Dallas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> for his junior year.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Randolph's mother decided the school he was attending in <a href="Arkansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a> was not right for him because of the differences he had with the coach and in school.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the time he was a virtually unknown player.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Pat Washington, Randolph's high school coach, stated that while Randolph was athletically gifted he needed a lot of work on skills such as ball handling, shooting, etc.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Washington also spoke of a technique the team had in workouts called the &quot;LAB,&quot; where the basic rules were that all players in play were required to never stop running under any circumstances, and if the ball was turned over at any point the player was to run back on defense immediately.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The technique might have contributed to Randolph's later defensive prowess, as he has been known to hustle back after <a href="Turnover_(basketball)" title="wikilink">turnovers</a> for defensive stops in his professional career. In high school, Randolph played all five positions on the floor.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During his senior season, Randolph's team did not qualify for a playoff position, which coach Washington attributed to bad chemistry.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Washington called the team very talented and referred to Randolph as the best player on the roster but stated that &quot;as time went by jealousy and agendas set in and took over.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Playing under coach Pat Washington, Randolph averaged 25.8 points and 12.6 rebounds as a senior.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Although Randolph was named to the first team All-Area Dallas Morning News boys basketball team, played in the <a href="Reebok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reebok</a> Round Ball Classic in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> and the <a href="Adidas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adidas</a> Derby Festival Classic in <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> (leading all scorers in both games), he was not chosen to play in the <a href="McDonald&#39;s_All-American_Game" title="wikilink">McDonald's All-American Game</a> his senior year.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Knowing there was a good chance he would be chosen in the first round, Randolph declared himself eligible for the <a href="2008_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">2008 NBA Draft</a> at the end of his freshman year at LSU.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Some projected Randolph to go high in the year's draft because of his versatility and potential, while his detractors thought he might drop because of his thin frame and believed his overall game to still be somewhat raw.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In either case, many believed Randolph could be the steal of the draft with his talent and tremendous potential.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the draft, the <a href="Golden_State_Warriors" title="wikilink">Golden State Warriors</a> selected Randolph with the fourteenth overall pick.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Warriors were coming off a disappointing <a href="2007-08_NBA_season" title="wikilink">2007-08 season</a> where the team was unable to qualify for the <a href="NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">playoffs</a> despite finishing the year with a 48-34 win-loss record.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Early in his rookie season, Randolph received a minimal amount of playing time, causing some to question his attitude and work ethic, or if a possible rift might be developing between head coach <a href="Don_Nelson" title="wikilink">Don Nelson</a> and he.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Many of the Warriors' main rotation players suffered injuries throughout Randolph's rookie campaign, and the team ended the season with only a 29-53 record.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Nonetheless, the Warriors did play a fairly strong second half of the season, including Randolph, who averaged 13.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 1.4 steals over the last twelve games of the year.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>After attending a <a href="Dallas_Mavericks" title="wikilink">Dallas Mavericks</a>-<a href="San_Antonio_Spurs" title="wikilink">San Antonio Spurs</a> playoff game during the Warriors' offseason, Randolph became motivated to improve his play, hitting the gym hard to prepare for the following season.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Randolph's efforts first began to reward him in that year's <a href="NBA_Summer_League" title="wikilink">Summer League</a> being held in <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> where he not only began to dominate consistently but was also referred to by various sportswriters as being the best talent in the entire Summer League.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
