<h2 id="professional-career">Professional career</h2>
<h3 id="to-2006">2005 to 2006</h3>
<p>Wakui was named to the Lions' <em>ichigun</em> (Japanese equivalent of &quot;major <a href="Sports_league" title="wikilink">league</a>&quot;) roster for their <a href="Season_(sports)" title="wikilink">season</a> opener in his <a href="rookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">rookie</a> season (), earning the first win of his professional career on June 18 in the last interleague game of the season against the <a href="Tokyo_Yakult_Swallows" title="wikilink">Yakult Swallows</a>. However, he finished the year with just a 1-6 <a href="Pitchers_of_record" title="wikilink">record</a> and a 7.32 <a href="Earned_run_average" title="wikilink">ERA</a>, giving up 11 home runs in 55 1/3 <a href="Innings_pitched" title="wikilink">innings</a>.</p>
<p>On March 26 , his first start of the season, Wakui earned a win against the <a href="Orix_Buffaloes" title="wikilink">Orix Buffaloes</a> with <a href="Ginjiro_Sumitani" title="wikilink">Ginjiro Sumitani</a> behind the plate (an 18-year-old rookie <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a> straight out of high school), marking the first time a pitcher and catcher both in their <a href="Teen_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">teens</a> had won a game in Japanese professional baseball since <a href="Takuro_Ishii" title="wikilink">Tadanori Ishii</a> (now Takuro Ishii) and <a href="Motonobu_Tanishige" title="wikilink">Motonobu Tanishige</a> accomplished the feat for the <a href="Yokohama_BayStars#Yokohama_Taiyo_Whales_(1978-1992)" title="wikilink">Yokohama Taiyo Whales</a> in .<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The two combined for another win on April 23 against the <a href="Tohoku_Rakuten_Golden_Eagles" title="wikilink">Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles</a>, the first complete game win as well as the first shutout of Wakui's career.</p>
<p>Wakui finished his sophomore season with a respectable 12-8 record, 3.24 ERA and 136 strikeouts in 178 innings pitched. He went 3-1 in June, earning <a href="Pacific_League" title="wikilink">Pacific League</a> <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> honors for that <a href="month" class="uri" title="wikilink">month</a>, and made his first <a href="Nippon_Professional_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star Game</a> appearance via <a href="Manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a> selection.</p>
<h3 id="section">2007</h3>
<p>On April 3 , in the fifth inning of a regular season game against the <a href="Fukuoka_SoftBank_Hawks" title="wikilink">Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks</a>, Wakui became just the 12th pitcher in NPB history to accomplish the unusual feat of striking out four batters in one inning.</p>
<p>He finished the season with a 17-10 record, leading the league in wins for the first time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He also led both Pacific and <a href="Central_League" title="wikilink">Central</a> leagues in innings pitched (213) and hits allowed (199) and came second to only <a href="Hokkaido_Nippon_Ham_Fighters" title="wikilink">Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters</a> ace <a href="Yu_Darvish" title="wikilink">Yu Darvish</a> in complete games (11).</p>
<p>That year, Wakui was named to the Japanese national team to play in the <a href="2007_Asian_Baseball_Championship" title="wikilink">2007 Asian Baseball Championship</a> (which also functioned as the Asian qualifying tournament for the <a href="2008_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2008 Beijing Olympics</a>). He and fellow 21-year-old Darvish, who had both been chosen to the national team for the first time, were the youngest members of the team. Wakui started in the Japan's first game against the <a href="Philippines_national_baseball_team" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and held them to just one hit over six shutout innings (Japan won the game 10-0 in seven innings as per the <a href="mercy_rule" title="wikilink">mercy rule</a>).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-1">2008</h3>
<p>In , Wakui was named the starter for the Lions' season opener for the first time in his career. He took the mound in their season opener against the Buffaloes on March 20, but incurred the loss desite throwing 140 pitches and holding the Buffaloes to two runs over eight innings.</p>
<p>Wakui was selected to the national team to play in the Olympics, starting in the game against <a href="Chinese_Taipei_national_baseball_team" title="wikilink">Chinese Taipei</a> in the <a href="Baseball_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics#Group_stage" title="wikilink">group stage</a> on August 14<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and holding them to one run over six innings in earning the win.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He followed up the effort with a two-hit, complete game (seven innings due to mercy rule) shutout against <a href="China_national_baseball_team" title="wikilink">China</a> on August 19.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, he had a down year overall, going just 10-11 in the regular season and posting an ERA (3.90) and <a href="Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched" title="wikilink">WHIP</a> (1.29) that were both worse than that of his 2007 season.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Wakui took the hill in Game 1<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and Game 5 of the Pacific League <a href="2008_Nippon_Professional_Baseball_season#Pacific_League" title="wikilink">Climax Series</a> (<a href="playoffs" class="uri" title="wikilink">playoffs</a>) against the Fighters, winning both starts and giving up just one run over 15 combined innings. In particular, he did not allow a single <a href="Baserunning#Becoming_a_runner" title="wikilink">baserunner</a> until two outs in the seventh inning in the latter game, finishing with a three-hit, complete game shutout and clinching a berth in the <a href="2008_Japan_Series" title="wikilink">Japan Series</a> for the Lions.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He was named the Pacific League Climax Series MVP. He pitched in three games in the <a href="Japan_Series" title="wikilink">Japan Series</a>, starting Game 1<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and Game 5 and even coming on in relief in Game 7 on two <a href="day" title="wikilink">days</a>' rest<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> to a key role in the Lions' championship (though he gave up six runs in 16 1/3 innings).</p>
<p>Wakui accepted the team's offer to change his uniform number from 16 to <strong>18</strong> during the <a href="Season_(sports)#Off-season" title="wikilink">off-season</a>, a number that denotes the team's ace pitcher in Japan. The last player to wear the number for the Lions was Matsuzaka, who pitched for the team between  and 2006. The number change also allowed teammate <a href="Kazuhisa_Ishii" title="wikilink">Kazuhisa Ishii</a> to change from #61(which he wore in 2008) to the #16 he wore for his entire career with the <a href="Yakult_Swallows" title="wikilink">Yakult Swallows</a>.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2009</h3>
<p>Wakui was named to the national team to play in the 2009 <a href="World_Baseball_Classic" title="wikilink">World Baseball Classic</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He pitched in three games as a <a href="Middle_relief_pitcher" title="wikilink">middle reliever</a>, going 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA and contributing to Japan's second consecutive tournament title. He carried over his performance into the  regular season, going 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA in the month of April. In particular, he held the Marines to one run while <a href="List_of_baseball_jargon_(G)#go_the_distance" title="wikilink">going the distance</a> in a 12-strikeout, complete game win on April 24<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, striking out every batter in the Marines' lineup at least once and recording at least one strikeout in every inning (the first time in <em>league history</em> that a pitcher had accomplished the two feats in the same game). He allowed just four hits en route to his first complete game shutout in two years on May 15 against the Marines.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pitching-style">Pitching style</h2>
<p>Wakui is a ,  <a href="Right-handedness" title="wikilink">right-handed</a> pitcher with an <a href="Pitcher#Pitching_in_a_game" title="wikilink">overhand</a> delivery. While his mechanics are well-balanced and mostly conventional, one unique trait in his delivery is how he completely straightens his left leg in a diagonal direction after raising it (and before dropping and driving towards the <a href="Baseball_field#Home_plate" title="wikilink">plate</a>).</p>
<p>Wakui throws an only average fastball<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, a mostly flat <a href="Four-seam_fastball" title="wikilink">four-seamer</a> that usually sits at  and tops out at  (though it does have some late life due to its excellent backspin). However, he complements it with an extremely wide assortment of secondary pitches, including a <a href="slider" class="uri" title="wikilink">slider</a>, <a href="Cutter_(baseball)" title="wikilink">cutter</a>, <a href="curveball" class="uri" title="wikilink">curveball</a>, <a href="forkball" class="uri" title="wikilink">forkball</a>, <a href="Circle_changeup" title="wikilink">changeup</a> and a good <a href="Sinker_(baseball)" title="wikilink">sinker</a>/<a href="shuuto" class="uri" title="wikilink">shuuto</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He also has excellent command, posting a <a href="Bases_on_balls_per_9_innings_pitched" title="wikilink">walks per nine innings</a> rate of 2.11 in 2007 and 2.65 in 2008.</p>
