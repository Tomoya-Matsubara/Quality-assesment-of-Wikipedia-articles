<p><a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> is home to Australia's highest snow country, oldest skifields and largest resorts.

<p>The <a href="Kiandra_snow_shoe_club" title="wikilink">Kiandra snow shoe club</a> (now called the <em>Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club (1861)</em>) remains the world's first identifiable and ceaseless Ski Club. This Australian club has been continuously operating since 1861. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s origins have been recognised internationally and substantiated by the <a href="Holmenkollen_Ski_Museum" title="wikilink">Holmenkollen Ski Museum</a>, Norway in 2006. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The discovery of gold in the mountains of America and Australia was the catalyst for the development of recreational alpine skiing. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>It has been claimed that an unidentifiable ski club (unnamed and without membership names) commenced in America in 1861. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The &quot;Trysil Skytte- og Skil&lt;U+00F8&gt;berforening&quot; (Shot and Ski Practitioner Association) was also founded in Trysil, Hedmark, Norway, in 1861. The association held their first competition in January 1862 <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Alpine_skiing" title="wikilink">Alpine skiing</a>, as a sport, commenced over twenty five years before any ski club can be identified as being formed in Europe. Alpine ski clubs were first founded in Munich, Germany 1891, Switzerland 1893, Arlberg, Austria 1901, followed by France and Italy. Sir Arnold Lunn founded the Kandahar Ski Club of Great Britain in 1924.</p>
<p>The &lt;U+201C&gt;Kiandra Snow Shoe Club&lt;U+201D&gt; held separate ski races for both ladies and children as early as 1885. Barbara Yan was the first identifiable woman documented as to having won a Downhill Skiing Championship. Barbara also won the ladies downhill in 1887, the year her siblings won the girls under 8 section and second in the under 12's. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1908 the club held the first ever documented International and Intercontinental Downhill Skiing Carnival. Results- America 1st, Australia 2nd, England 3rd. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Australia's Longest Running Skiing Competition is The Balmain Cup. By 1933 team racing was open to virtually all competitors from any club or imported talents but Arthur Balmain of <a href="Cooma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cooma</a> believed this was unfair to local enthusiasts. He donated a perpetual trophy open only to competitors residing in or about the Southern Districts and only for members who held membership for twelve weeks in the local ski-Club. Arthur Balmain, whose company transported skiers to all localities, envisaged a competition that would encompass all Clubs. He decreed that a team must compete for the Balmain Cup with all members competing in four disciplines, Downhill, Slalom, Jump and Langlauf. In 1946 the competition format for competitors eligibility was changed and the jump section was removed. History of the event. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In the wilderness region south of Kiandra, The Alpine Hut, near <a href="Mount_Jagungal" title="wikilink">Mount Jagungal</a> was built in 1939 to cater for skiers. Access was arduous - via packhorse and ski.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the township remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing for over a century. Australia's first <a href="T-Bar" class="uri" title="wikilink">T-Bar</a>, was installed at Kiandra in 1957, but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to <a href="Selwyn_Snowfields" title="wikilink">Selwyn Snowfields</a> in 1978<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south and in the 20th Century, the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to the <a href="Mount_Kosciuszko" title="wikilink">Mount Kosciuszko</a> region<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In 1900, a hut was built at <a href="Bett&#39;s_Camp" title="wikilink">Bett's Camp</a>, above the Thredbo Escarpment and came into use for winter skiers. The Hotel Kosciusko was opened by the New South Wales Government in 1909 at what is now Sponars Chalet, near Smiggin Holes.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The first Kosciuszko Chalet was built at <a href="Charlotte_Pass" title="wikilink">Charlotte Pass</a> in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the &quot;World's Longest <a href="Chairlift" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chairlift</a>&quot;, designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>. At 1760m, Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at <a href="Smiggin_Holes" title="wikilink">Smiggin Holes</a> around 1939, where horse drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to be begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>. It was the construction of the vast <a href="Snowy_Mountains_Hydro-Electric_Scheme" title="wikilink">Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme</a> from 1949 that really opened up the <a href="Snowy_Mountains" title="wikilink">Snowy Mountains</a> for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of <a href="Thredbo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thredbo</a> and Perisher as leading Australian resorts.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>. The Construction of <a href="Guthega" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guthega</a> Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Skifields up by Kosciusko's side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club was founded in 1950 by <a href="Charles_Anton" title="wikilink">Charles Anton</a> with a view to establishing a chain of lodges for ski touring across the Australian Alps. Huts were constructed in the &quot;Back Country&quot; close to Mount Kosciusko, including <a href="Kunama_Hut" title="wikilink">Kunama Hut</a>, which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on <a href="Mount_Northcote" title="wikilink">Mount Northcote</a> at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an <a href="avalanche" class="uri" title="wikilink">avalanche</a>, which also killed one person, in 1956<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Anton also recognised the potential of the Thredbo Valley for construction of a major resort and village, with good vertical terrain. Construction began in 1957 <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>. Today, Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australia's longest ski resort run, the 5.9 km from Karel's T-Bar to <a href="Friday_Flat" title="wikilink">Friday Flat</a>; Australia's greatest vertical drop of 672m; and the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037m<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of <a href="Blue_Cow" title="wikilink">Mount Blue Cow</a> in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed <a href="Skitube_Alpine_Railway" title="wikilink">Skitube Alpine Railway</a> opened to deliver skiers from <a href="Bullocks_Flat,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bullocks Flat</a>, on the <a href="Alpine_Way" title="wikilink">Alpine Way</a>, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the <a href="Southern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Southern Hemisphere</a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>.

<p>A hospice was built at Mount Saint Bernard (Elevation 1540) around 1863 along a track developed to link the Victorian gold fields. Snowshoes were developed locally to assist winter travellers and a larger hospice built around 1884. Recreational and practical skiing was being practised in the area by the 1880s and 90s with skis made from local timbers, and making use of single steering poles. The first winter traverse of the Victorian Alps was made in 1900, via the Hospice and Mount Hotham. The Hospice operated as a recreational ski location into the 1930s, but was destroyed by bushfire in 1939<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>

<p>According to the Australian Government's &quot;Bureau of Meteorology&quot;, in most years snow is sufficient above about 1500 metres to sustain a &quot;viable ski industry&quot;. However, snow falls can vary greatly from year to year. In 1973 temperatures remained too warm, while in 1982 it was too dry for much of a snow season. However, some other years have abundant snow - the Bureau cites 1981 as an example. The unpredictability of Australian snow conditions was highlighted in 2006 when severe drought and a poor snow season gave way to a &quot;White Christmas&quot; and abundant snow falls in the alpine regions of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and even a low altitude snow fall on the 25th of December in the <a href="Dandenong_Ranges" title="wikilink">Dandenong Ranges</a> on <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>'s north-eastern fringe<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a>. Snow making equipment at ski resorts has reduced uncertainty in recent times<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> . In New South Wales, a heavy natural snow season can see a base of up to 3.6 meters in August, at an elevation of 1830m at Spencer's Creek, (near <a href="Charlotte_Pass" title="wikilink">Charlotte Pass</a>) - see below chart. Typically, depths will be lower than this.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Low altitude and often dry climate; as well as seasonal (early spring) dust storms in the Simpson Desert depositing red dust on the ranges (causing less UV reflection and therefore faster melting) keep the snow season relatively short (June-Oct). Heavy snow can fall however, at anytime between April and December in the Australian High Country (see chart from <a href="Snowy_Hydro" title="wikilink">Snowy Hydro</a>). The official opening of the ski season for most resorts coincides with the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Official_Birthday" title="wikilink">Queens Birthday Long Weekend</a> on the second Monday in June.</p>
