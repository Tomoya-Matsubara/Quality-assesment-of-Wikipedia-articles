<p><strong>King's Highway 410</strong>, also known as <strong>Highway 410</strong> and colloquially as <strong>the four-ten</strong>, is a <a href="400-series_highways" title="wikilink">400-series highway</a> in the <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> province of <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a> that connects Highways <a href="Ontario_Highway_401" title="wikilink">401</a> and <a href="Ontario_Highway_403" title="wikilink">403</a> to <a href="Brampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brampton</a>. North of Brampton, the <a href="Controlled-access_highway" title="wikilink">freeway</a> connects to <a href="Ontario_Highway_10" title="wikilink">Highway 10</a>, which continues north through <a href="Caledon,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Caledon</a> as a four lane <a href="arterial_road" title="wikilink">arterial road</a>. The route is patrolled by the <a href="Ontario_Provincial_Police" title="wikilink">Ontario Provincial Police</a> and has a speed limit of .</p>
<p>Highway 410 was built along the <a href="right-of-way_(transportation)" title="wikilink">alignment</a> of Heart Lake Road south of Boivard Drive, while north of Boivard Drive it was built along a new alignment. The highway was designated in 1978 between Highway 401 and Boivard Drive (later <a href="Ontario_Highway_7" title="wikilink">Highway 7</a>), though it was only two lanes wide and did not feature any <a href="interchange_(road)" title="wikilink">interchanges</a>. It was widened throughout the 1980s and completed as a freeway in 1991. In 2003, construction began on a northward extension of the freeway that was completed in late 2009.</p>
<p>A notable feature of Highway 410 is the four-level interchange with Highways 401 and 403 which includes a large <a href="flyover_(overpass)" title="wikilink">flyover</a> ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 410 northbound, constructed in 1990. The entire freeway features a grass median as opposed to an <a href="Ontario_Tall_Wall" title="wikilink">Ontario Tall Wall</a> like neighbouring freeways.</p>

<p><img src="Courtney_Park_and_410.JPG" title="fig:The 410 and Courtneypark Drive" alt="The 410 and Courtneypark Drive" /> Highway 410 is a commuter freeway and a bypass of Brampton, acting as the southward continuation of <a href="Ontario_Highway_10" title="wikilink">Highway 10</a>. The highway is also a continuation of Highway 403 from the south, which ends at the 401. The freeway begins as several ramps converge from Highway 401 north of the large interchange.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Maintaining a straight north-westward course, it passes beneath Courtney Park Drive and Derry Road, with a slight jog to the right between the two underpasses. The freeway then intersects <a href="Ontario_Highway_407" title="wikilink">Highway 407</a> as it crosses into Brampton and passes beneath an electrical corridor. Veering to the right once again, the freeway enters a second industrialized area and returns to its northwest–southeast orientation. It passes beneath <a href="Steeles_Avenue" title="wikilink">Steeles Avenue</a> and later Queen Street East, the former <a href="Ontario_Highway_7" title="wikilink">Highway 7</a>, now <a href="Peel_Regional_Road_107" title="wikilink">Peel Regional Road 107</a>. Until it was decommissioned across the <a href="Greater_Toronto_Area" title="wikilink">Greater Toronto Area</a>, Highway 7 was <a href="concurrency_(road)" title="wikilink">concurrent</a> between Queen Street East and Boivard Drive. Passing north of Queen Street, the highway exits the industrial area and enters residential subdivisions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout this section, Highway 410 is located within a <a href="Cutting_(transportation)" title="wikilink">cutting</a> below grade. It passes beneath several roads until Bovaird Drive. The recently completed extension begins at this point,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as Highway 410 passes to the west of <a href="Trinity_Common" title="wikilink">Trinity Common</a> and diverges from its straight path into <a href="Natural_environment" title="wikilink">greenspace</a> and alongside the <a href="Heart_Lake_Conservation_Area" title="wikilink">Heart Lake Conservation Area</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As it passes beneath Mayfield Road, the highway makes a sharp turn to the west and descends through the <a href="Etobicoke_Creek" title="wikilink">Etobicoke Creek</a> valley.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After rising back to level ground, it curves north, passing beneath Valleywood Drive. The central concrete median and high-mast lighting end as the freeway becomes Highway 10, which continues north as a four-lane undivided road to <a href="Orangeville,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Orangeville</a>, <a href="Shelburne,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Shelburne</a> and eventually <a href="Owen_Sound" title="wikilink">Owen Sound</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Highway_401_interchange_with_403-410_in_1987.jpg" title="fig:Until 1990, Highway 410 did not connect with Highway 403, and existed as a Super two north of Highway 401" alt="Until 1990, Highway 410 did not connect with Highway 403, and existed as a Super two north of Highway 401" /> Planning for highway 410 began during the late 1960s as a result of the rapid suburbanization of Brampton. On May 25, 1965, the Department of Highways (DHO) unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated several new highway corridors and widening projects through Peel and <a href="Regional_Municipality_of_Halton" title="wikilink">Halton</a>, including Highway 10.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, it did not include a truck bypass that was desired by Brampton city council. In 1969, <a href="William_H._Brydon" title="wikilink">William H. Brydon</a> would encourage the DHO to construct this bypass utilizing Heart Lake Road, and announced the plans at his final city council meeting as mayor, claiming that it may be known as the Brampton Expressway and would connect with Highway 401.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Successor Jim Archdekin announced in the new year that he would meet with highways minister <a href="George_Gomme" title="wikilink">George Gomme</a> to discuss the route of the bypass.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The DHO studied the corridor over the next several months before releasing a report in late August.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Ontario Premier <a href="Bill_Davis" title="wikilink">Bill Davis</a>, who was known as &quot;Brampton Billy&quot;, formally initiated the construction of Highway 410 along the Heart Lake Road corridor during his administration.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Prior to the construction of Highway 410, Heart Lake Road was flanked by the industrial lands of Brampton and <a href="Bramalea,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Bramalae</a> north of Steeles Avenue. Between Steeles and Highway 401 was agricultural lands.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1975, construction began on the widening of Highway 401 between Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) and Highway 427. During this expansion from six to eight lanes, a directional and loop ramp were constructed at Heart Lake Road to allow access to and from Toronto.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Heart Lake Road was rebuilt over the next several years, and reopened as a <a href="Super_two" title="wikilink">two lane expressway</a> in 1978. It was at this point that the road was designated Highway 410 as far north as Queen Street.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Construction to <a href="twinning_(roads)" title="wikilink">twin</a> the highway began in 1983, following the completion of a culvert over the east branch of the Etobicoke Creek;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> the interchange with Clark Boulevard was built at the same time.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The City of Brampton constructed the West Drive Extension, between Orenda Road and Tomken Road, as a detour in 1983. The following year, contracts were awarded to build the two structures over the <a href="Canadian_National_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian National Railway</a> south of Orenda Road,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> as well as an interchange at Queen Street; the former was completed by the end of the year while the latter took until late 1985. Construction of the interchange at Boivard Drive began in 1985 and was completed the following summer.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> With the construction of each interchange, the future northbound lanes of the freeway were constructed and opened to two-way traffic. By 1988, two lanes were open between Steeles Avenue and Boivard Drive.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1987, construction began south of the future Highway 407 interchange, expanding the two lane Heart Lake Road to a six lane freeway. In addition, work began on the future southbound lanes north of Steeles Avenue.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In 1990, work began on an interchange with Courtney Park Drive. By mid 1991, Highway 410 was complete from north of Highway 401 to Boivard Drive, and work was underway on two large flyover ramps.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The interchange with Highway 401 was rebuilt alongside the windening of that highway to a <a href="collector-express_system" title="wikilink">collector-express system</a> and opened to traffic ramp-by-ramp beginning August 28, 1990 and continuing through the end of the year.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In the fall of 1991, alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410, which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic, while new overpasses were constructed for the Highway 401 express lanes.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The  link opened on November 2, 1992 at a cost of $7.3 million.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

Note the placeholders for high-mast lighting on the median." alt="The new 410 extension crossing Etobicoke Creek. Note the placeholders for high-mast lighting on the median." /> The extension beyond Boivard Drive to Hurontario was conceived as part of the ultimate plan for Highway 410 when it was under construction in 1982.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It would take until 2003 for construction to begin.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Planning for the  freeway began with the submitting of an Environmental Assessment by the MTO in October 1995.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The assessment was approved without a hearing by the Minister of Environment and Energy on March 5, 1997.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The next several years were spent on engineering and design. The new section, planned and built as a four lane freeway, was constructed on a new alignment in order to bypass the <a href="Heart_Lake_Conservation_Area" title="wikilink">Heart Lake Conservation Area</a>. It was completed in phases: initially to the new eastward extension of Sandalwood Parkway, later to Mayfield Road and finally to Highway 10 north of <a href="Sandalwood,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Sandalwood</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Premier_of_Ontario" title="wikilink">Premier of Ontario</a> <a href="Ernie_Eves" title="wikilink">Ernie Eves</a> officially announced the extension on June 23, 2003; construction subsequently began on the first phase.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> On May 15, 2006 construction began on the second phase between Sandalwood Parkway and Mayfield Drive.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The first two phases were built by <a href="Dufferin_Construction" title="wikilink">Dufferin Construction</a> and opened together in mid&lt;U+2013&gt;late 2007; the northbound lanes were opened by the beginning of September and the southbound lanes by the end of the month. Upon its opening, trucks were prohibited from driving along it due to concerns of them travelling on the two lane Mayfield Road; this ban has since been lifted.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Construction on the third phase between Mayfield Road and Highway 10 began in August 2007.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The entire extension was completed and opened to traffic on November 16, 2009.
