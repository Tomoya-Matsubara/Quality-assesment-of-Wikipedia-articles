<h2 id="youth">Youth</h2>
<p>Pariani, the son of Italian immigrant parents, grew up in a working class Italian neighborhood called The Hill in <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. The younger of two brothers, Pariani&lt;U+2019&gt;s childhood consisted primarily of school, working at a local laundromat and playing street sports.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Pariani&lt;U+2019&gt;s joined a local youth club when he was thirteen.</p>
<h2 id="club-career">Club career</h2>
<p>In 1943, Pariani joined Schumachers when he as fifteen. That year, he won his first title, a St. Louis Municipal League championship, with Schumachers. He then moved to Raftery&lt;U+2019&gt;s S.C. and remained with them through the 1946-1947 season. That year he was voted the league MVP. In 1947, Carrenti Cleaners came under new sponsorship. The renamed team, now known as <a href="St._Louis_Simpkins-Ford" title="wikilink">St. Louis Simpkins-Ford</a>, recruited Pariani. He would experience considerable success with Simpkins, winning the 1948 and 1950 <a href="Lamar_Hunt_U.S._Open_Cup" title="wikilink">U.S. Open Cup</a> championships. He continued to play until 1963. Some time during his career, he also played for Calcaterra and Wildcats A.C. Pariani was a St. Louis all-star selection every year from 1946 through 1953.</p>
<h2 id="national-and-olympic-team">National and Olympic team</h2>
<p>His success at the club level led to Pariani&lt;U+2019&gt;s selection to the <a href="United_States_at_the_1948_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">U.S. soccer team</a> at the <a href="Football_at_the_1948_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1948 Summer Olympics</a>.

With the support of both families, he and his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt; moved up the day to allow him to play in Brazil.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When he left St. Louis for New York, he had been married for only three days. He went on to score the lone U.S. goal in the team&lt;U+2019&gt;s first game of the finals, a 3-1 loss to <a href="Spain_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Spain</a>. Four days later, he was a key part of the U.S. victory over <a href="England_national_football_team" title="wikilink">England</a>, maintaining good ball possession. He also sent <a href="Frank_Wallace_(soccer)" title="wikilink">Frank Wallace</a> on a break towards the English goal, a break stopped by <a href="Alf_Ramsey" title="wikilink">Alf Ramsey</a>.
