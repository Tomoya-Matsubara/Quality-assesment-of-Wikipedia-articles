<p>One of Sam's main storylines was her battle with bipolar disorder, which was triggered by a miscarriage.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The storyline required careful planning as <em>Neighbours</em> production team wanted to portray the issue sensitivley.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Buchanan whose real life brother suffers from the illness, worked closely with charity <a href="SANE_Australia" title="wikilink">SANE Australia</a> to carry out the relevant research.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> With their help the scriptwriters, production team and Buchanan worked to portray the illness as accurate as, possible.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Buchanan's brother, Miles, suffers from the illness and is a spokesperson for the charity.

We have a responsibility because misinformation can cause a lot of problems, but proper information can do a lot of good.
