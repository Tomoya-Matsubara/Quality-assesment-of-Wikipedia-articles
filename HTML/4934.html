<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The concept for <em>Cheers</em> was the end result of a long consideration process. The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, hoping to be similar to <em><a href="The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show" title="wikilink">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>. They considered making an American version of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <em><a href="Fawlty_Towers" title="wikilink">Fawlty Towers</a></em> centered around a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting the show began to resemble the <a href="Radio_programming" title="wikilink">radio show</a> <em><a href="Duffy&#39;s_Tavern" title="wikilink">Duffy's Tavern</a></em>. They liked the idea of a tavern as it provided a continuous stream of new people arriving, giving them a constant supply of characters.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Cheers_Street_Boston_2005.jpg" title="fig:Picture of Bull &amp; Finch Pub in Boston in 2005. This view is similar to the opening credits of the show." alt="Picture of Bull &amp; Finch Pub in Boston in 2005. This view is similar to the opening credits of the show." /> After choosing a plot, the three had to choose a location. Early discussions centered around <a href="Barstow,_California" title="wikilink">Barstow, California</a>, then <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. They eventually turned to the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast</a> and Boston. The <a href="Bull_&amp;_Finch_Pub" title="wikilink">Bull &amp; Finch Pub</a> in Boston that Cheers was styled after was originally chosen from a <a href="Telephone_directory" title="wikilink">phone book</a>. When Glen Charles asked the owner to shoot initial <a href="Establishing_shot" title="wikilink">exterior</a> and interior shots the owner agreed, charging <a href="United_States_Dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>1. He has since gone on to make millions, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of <em>Cheers</em> memorabilia, making the Bull &amp; Finch the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997. Coincidentally, during the casting of Shelley Long (who was in Boston at the time filming <em><a href="A_Small_Circle_of_Friends" title="wikilink">A Small Circle of Friends</a></em>), Long remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in Boston, which turned out to be the Bull &amp; Finch.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Most <em>Cheers</em> episodes were shot before a live studio audience on Paramount Stage 25, generally on Tuesday nights. Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a <a href="read-through" class="uri" title="wikilink">read-through</a>, Friday was <a href="rehearsal" class="uri" title="wikilink">rehearsal</a> day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Nearly 100 crewmembers were involved in the shooting of any given episode. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on shooting on <a href="film" class="uri" title="wikilink">film</a> rather than <a href="videotape" class="uri" title="wikilink">videotape</a>. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to always keep characters moving rather than standing still.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crew">Crew</h3>
<p>The crew of <em>Cheers</em> numbered in the hundreds; as such, this section only provides a brief summary of the many crewmembers for the show. The three creators — <a href="James_Burrows" title="wikilink">James Burrows</a>, <a href="Glen_Charles" title="wikilink">Glen Charles</a>, and <a href="Les_Charles" title="wikilink">Les Charles</a> — stayed on throughout the series as executive producers along with <a href="Tom_Palmer" title="wikilink">Tom Palmer</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In fact, the two Charles brothers kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the <em>Cheers</em> run. In the final seasons, however, they handed over much of the show to Burrows. Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the episodes and supervising the show's production.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="David_Angell" title="wikilink">David Angell</a> was also a part of the crew from the start, writing many <em>Cheers</em> episodes. The show was often noted for its writing,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> which most credit, along with other production factors and the ensemble cast, for the show's success.</p>
<h2 id="awards">Awards</h2>
<p>Over its eleven-season run, <em>Cheers</em> and its cast and crew earned many awards. <em>Cheers</em> earned a record 111 <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy</a> nominations, with a total of 26 wins.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In addition, <em>Cheers</em> has earned 31 <a href="Golden_Globe_Award" title="wikilink">Golden Globe</a> nominations, with a total of six wins. All ten of the actors who were regulars on the series received Emmy nominations for their roles. <em>Cheers</em> won the Golden Globe for &quot;Best TV-Series - Comedy/Musical&quot; in 1991 and the Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; in 1983, 1984, 1989 and 1991. <em>Cheers</em> was presented with the &quot;Legend Award&quot; at the 2006 <a href="TV_Land_Awards" title="wikilink">TV Land Awards</a>, with many surviving cast members attending the event.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Nearly all of <em>Cheers</em> took place in the front room of the bar, but they often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office. <em>Cheers</em> didn't show any action <a href="Cheers#Outside_the_bar" title="wikilink">outside the bar</a> until the first episode of the second season, which took the action to Diane's apartment. <em>Cheers</em> had some <a href="running_gag" title="wikilink">running gags</a>, such as Norm arriving in the bar greeted by a loud &quot;Norm!&quot; Early episodes generally followed Sam's antics with his various women, following a variety of <a href="Romantic_comedy_film" title="wikilink">romantic comedy</a> <a href="clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a> to get out of whatever relationship troubles he was in for each episode.

After Sam and Diane's courtship was consummated, the show's popularity grew greatly and subsequent TV shows now very commonly have such &quot;will they or won't they&quot; tensions between opposites.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-issues">Social issues</h3>
<p>Many <em>Cheers</em> scripts centered around or touched on a variety of social issues, albeit humorously. As <em>Toasting Cheers</em> puts it:<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> </p>
<p><a href="Social_class" title="wikilink">Social class</a> was a subtext of the show. The &quot;upper class&quot; - represented by characters like Diane Chambers, Frasier Crane, Lilith Sternin and (initially) Rebecca Howe — rubbed shoulders with middle and working class characters — Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and <a href="millionaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">millionaire</a>'s daughter <a href="Kelly_Gaines" title="wikilink">Kelly Gaines</a>. Many viewers enjoyed <em>Cheers</em> in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Feminism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Feminism</a> and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some seeing each of the major female characters as a flawed feminist in her own way.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Diane was a vocal feminist, but Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a <a href="Womanizing" title="wikilink">womanizer</a> and a <a href="Male_chauvinism" title="wikilink">male chauvinist</a>. Their relationship led Diane to several diatribes on Sam's promiscuity, while Carla merely insulted people.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Carla was respected because of her power, while Diane was ignored as she commanded little respect. Rebecca was a stereotypical ambitious and <a href="Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships" title="wikilink">golddigging</a> woman, seeking relationships with her superiors at the Lillian Corporation, most notably <a href="Robin_Colcord" title="wikilink">Robin Colcord</a>, to gain promotions or raises. However, she encountered a <a href="glass_ceiling" title="wikilink">glass ceiling</a> and ended the show by marrying a plumber rather than a rich businessman.</p>
<p><a href="Homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homosexuality</a> was dealt with from the very first season, a rare move for American network television in the early 1980s. In the first season episode &quot;The Boys In The Bar&quot; (after the 1970s film <em><a href="The_Boys_in_the_Band" title="wikilink">The Boys in the Band</a></em>) a friend and former teammate of Sam's <a href="Coming_out" title="wikilink">comes out</a> in his <a href="autobiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">autobiography</a>. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a <a href="gay_bar" title="wikilink">gay bar</a>. The episode won a <a href="Gay_and_Lesbian_Alliance_Against_Defamation" title="wikilink">GLAAD</a> <a href="GLAAD_Media_Awards" title="wikilink">Media Award</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and the script's writers, <a href="Ken_Levine_(TV_personality)" title="wikilink">Ken Levine</a> &amp; David Isaacs, were nominated for an Emmy Award for their writing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Harvey_Fierstein" title="wikilink">Harvey Fierstein</a> would later appear in the 1990s as &quot;Mark Newberger&quot;, Rebecca's old high school sweetheart who is gay. Finally, the final episode included a gay man who gets into trouble with his boyfriend (played by <a href="Anthony_Heald" title="wikilink">Anthony Heald</a>) after agreeing to pose as Diane's husband.</p>
<p><a href="Addiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">Addiction</a> also plays a role in <em>Cheers</em>, almost exclusively through Sam, although some critics believed the issue was never really developed.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Sam was a recovering <a href="alcoholism" title="wikilink">alcoholic</a> who ended up buying a bar after his baseball career was ruined by his drinking.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Frasier also has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth season episode &quot;The Triangle&quot;, while Woody develops a <a href="problem_gambling" title="wikilink">gambling</a> problem in the seventh season's &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. Some critics believe Sam was a generally <a href="Addiction" title="wikilink">addictive personality</a> who had largely conquered his alcoholism but was still a <a href="Sexual_addiction" title="wikilink">sexual addict</a>, shown through his womanizing.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cheers-owners"><em>Cheers</em> owners</h3>
<p><img src="Cheers_Boston_2005.jpg" title="fig:The Cheers sign in 2005." alt="The Cheers sign in 2005." /> Cheers obviously had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889 (The &quot;Est. 1895&quot; on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for <a href="numerology" title="wikilink">numerological</a> purposes as revealed in the 8th season episode &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot;). In the second episode, &quot;Sam's Women&quot;, Norm tells a customer looking for the owner of Cheers that the man he thought was the owner has been replaced, and his replacement was replaced by Sam. Then in a later episode Gus O'Mally, who sold the bar to Sam, comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.</p>
<p>The biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth season finale, &quot;I Do, Adieu&quot;, when Sam and Diane part ways, Shelley Long leaves the regular cast, and Sam leaves to attempt <a href="Circumnavigation" title="wikilink">circumnavigating</a> the Earth. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. Sam returns in the sixth season premiere, &quot;Home is the Sailor&quot;, having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh season premiere, &quot;How to Recede in Business&quot;, Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca &quot;agree&quot; (<a href="in_absentia" title="wikilink">in absentia</a>) to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.</p>
<p>From there Sam would occasionally attempt to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved wealthy executive <a href="Robin_Colcord" title="wikilink">Robin Colcord</a>. Cheers did eventually end up back in Sam's hands in the eighth season finale, when it was sold back to him for eighty-five <a href="Cent_(U.S._coin)" title="wikilink">cents</a> by the Lillian Corporation after he alerted the company of Colcord's <a href="insider_trading" title="wikilink">insider trading</a>. Fired by the corporation over her keeping quiet, Rebecca earns back a hostess/office manager job from Sam.</p>
<h3 id="other-recurring-themes">Other recurring themes</h3>
<p>Aside from the storylines that spanned across the series, <em>Cheers</em> had several themes that followed no storylines but that recurred throughout the series. There was a heated rivalry between Cheers and the rival bar, Gary's Olde Towne Tavern since fourth season episode &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot;. Starting with the sixth season one episode of every season depicted some wager between Sam and Gary, which resulted in either a sports competition or a battle of wits that devolved into complex practical jokes. Aside from the very first and very last &quot;Bar Wars&quot; episodes, the Cheers gang almost always lost to Gary's superior ingenuity, though they managed to trick him into missing the annual Bloody Mary contest in one episode. Another episode had Sam collaborating with Gary's to get revenge on his co-workers on a prior practical joke. Sam also had a long-running feud with the management of the upscale restaurant situated directly above the bar, Melville's. The restaurant's management found the bar's clientele decidedly uncouth, while Sam regarded the restaurant as snobbish (despite the fact that customers often drifted between the two businesses via a prominent staircase). This conflict escalated in later seasons, when Melville's came under the ownership of John Allen Hill (<a href="Keene_Curtis" title="wikilink">Keene Curtis</a>), and it emerged that Sam did not technically own the bar's poolroom and bathrooms. Sam subsequently was forced to pay rent for them and often found himself at the mercy of Hill's tyranny. Rebecca eventually bought the back section from Hill, making her and Sam partners in managing the bar.</p>
<p>Norm Peterson continually searched for gainful employment as an accountant but spent most of the series unemployed, thereby explaining his constant presence in Cheers at the same stool. The face of his wife, Vera, was <a href="Unseen_character" title="wikilink">never fully seen onscreen</a>, despite a few fleeting appearances and a couple of vocal cameos. She first appeared shortly in the fifth season episode &quot;Thanksgiving Orphans&quot; with her whole face being covered in cake. Cliff Clavin seemed unable to shake the constant presence of his mother, Esther Clavin (<a href="Frances_Sternhagen" title="wikilink">Frances Sternhagen</a>). Though she did not appear in every episode, he would refer to her quite often, mostly as both an emotional burden and a smothering parent. Her first onscreen appearance was in the fifth season. Carla Tortelli carried a reputation of being both highly fertile and matrimonially inept. The last husband she had on the show, <a href="Eddie_LeBec" title="wikilink">Eddie LeBec</a>, was a washed-up <a href="ice_hockey" title="wikilink">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender" class="uri" title="wikilink">goaltender</a> who ended up dying in an ice show accident involving a <a href="zamboni" class="uri" title="wikilink">zamboni</a>. Carla later discovered that Eddie had cheated on her, marrying another woman after impregnating her. Carla's sleazy first husband, <a href="Nick_Tortelli" title="wikilink">Nick Tortelli</a>, also made frequent appearances, mostly to torment Carla with a new custody battle or legal scam that grew out of their divorce. Carla's eight children (four of whom were &quot;born&quot; during the show's run) were also notoriously ill-behaved, save Lud, who was sired by a prominent academician.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reactions">Critical reactions</h2>
<p><em>Cheers</em> was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of only 74 shows in that year's ratings.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> This critical support, coupled with early success at the Emmys and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division <a href="Brandon_Tartikoff" title="wikilink">Brandon Tartikoff</a>, is thought to be the main reason for the show's survival and eventual success.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The cast themselves went across the country on various <a href="talk_show" title="wikilink">talk shows</a> to try to further promote the series after its first season. With the growing popularity of <em><a href="Family_Ties" title="wikilink">Family Ties</a></em> which ran in the slot ahead of <em>Cheers</em> from January 1984 until <em>Family Ties</em> was moved to Sundays in 1987 and the placement of <em><a href="The_Cosby_Show" title="wikilink">The Cosby Show</a></em> in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed &quot;<a href="Must_See_TV" title="wikilink">Must See Thursday</a>&quot;. The next season, <em>Cheers</em> ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By its final season <em>Cheers</em> had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the Top Ten of the <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen ratings</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Some critics now use <em><a href="Frasier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frasier</a></em> and <em>Cheers</em> as a model of a successful spin-off for a character from an already successful series to compare to modern spin-offs.</p>
<p>NBC dedicated a whole night to the final episode of <em>Cheers</em>. The show began with a &quot;pregame&quot; show hosted by <a href="Bob_Costas" title="wikilink">Bob Costas</a>, followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to <em>Cheers</em> during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">Tonight Show</a></em> broadcast live from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the <a href="List_of_most-watched_television_episodes" title="wikilink">most-watched television episode</a>, it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 80.4 million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The episode originally aired in the usual <em>Cheers</em> spot of Thursday night and was then rebroadcast on Sunday. Some estimate that while the original broadcast did not outperform the <a href="Goodbye,_Farewell_and_Amen" title="wikilink"><em>M*A*S*H</em> finale</a>, the combined non-repeating audiences for the Thursday and Sunday showings did. <em>Toasting Cheers</em> also notes that television had greatly changed between the <em><a href="M*A*S*H_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">M*A*S*H</a></em> and <em>Cheers</em> finales, leaving <em>Cheers</em> with a broader array of competition for ratings.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Some of the actors and actresses from <em>Cheers</em> brought their characters into other television shows, either in a guest appearance or in a new <a href="spin-off" class="uri" title="wikilink">spin-off</a>. The most successful <em>Cheers</em> spin-off was the show <em><a href="Frasier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frasier</a></em> which directly followed Frasier Crane after he moved back to <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Washington</a> (on the other end of <a href="Interstate_90" title="wikilink">Interstate 90</a>) to live with his recently-disabled father and to host a call-in radio show. Frasier was originally supposed to be a small disliked character who only existed to further Diane and Sam's relationship, but Kelsey Grammer's acting turned what were supposed to be unfunny lines into comedy the audience enjoyed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Sam, Diane and Woody all had individual crossover appearances on <em>Frasier</em> where they came to visit Frasier, and his ex-wife <a href="Lilith_Sternin" title="wikilink">Lilith</a> was a constant supporting character throughout <em>Frasier</em>. Cliff, Norm, Carla, and two of Cheers' regular background barflies Paul and Phil, had a crossover together in the <a href="List_of_Frasier_episodes" title="wikilink"><em>Frasier</em> episode</a> &quot;<a href="Cheerful_Goodbyes" title="wikilink">Cheerful Goodbyes</a>&quot;. In that episode, Frasier, on a trip to Boston, meets the Cheers gang (though not at Cheers itself) and Cliff thinks Frasier has flown out specifically for his (Cliff's) retirement party, which Frasier ends up attending. Rebecca Howe is the only <em>Cheers</em> regular aside from Coach (whose actor, Nicholas Colasanto, had died, after which the character died in the series) to not appear on <em>Frasier</em>. <em>Frasier</em> was on the air for as many seasons as <em>Cheers</em>, going off the air in 2004 after an eleven-season run. Although <em>Frasier</em> was the most successful spin-off, <em><a href="The_Tortellis" title="wikilink">The Tortellis</a></em> was the first series to spin off from <em>Cheers</em>, premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband <a href="Nick_Tortelli" title="wikilink">Nick Tortelli</a> and his wife <a href="Loretta_Tortelli" title="wikilink">Loretta</a>, but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian Americans.</p>
<p>In addition to direct spin-offs, several <em>Cheers</em> characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows. In <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="Fear_of_Flying_(Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Fear of Flying</a>&quot;, <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> stumbles into a Cheers-like bar after being kicked out of <a href="Moe_Szyslak" title="wikilink">Moe's</a>. Most of the central cast appears in the episode, including Frasier (though ironically, Frasier does not speak, as Grammer already had a recurring role on <em>The Simpsons</em> as <a href="Sideshow_Bob" title="wikilink">Sideshow Bob</a>). The tagline for Moe's Tavern, &quot;Where nobody knows your name&quot;, is also a reference to the theme song of <em>Cheers</em>. Characters also had crossovers with <em><a href="Wings_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Wings</a></em>—which was created by <em>Cheers</em> producers&lt;U+2013&gt;writers—and <em><a href="St._Elsewhere" title="wikilink">St. Elsewhere</a></em> in a somewhat rare comedy&lt;U+2013&gt;drama crossover.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> character <a href="List_of_Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine_characters#Morn" title="wikilink">Morn</a>, who remained mostly at <a href="Quark_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Quark's Bar</a>, is named (as an <a href="anagram" class="uri" title="wikilink">anagram</a>) for Norm Peterson.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The bar and its patrons were also featured in two Disney specials, a scene in <em><a href="Disney_anthology_television_series" title="wikilink">The Wonderful World of Disney</a></em> TV special <em><a href="Mickey&#39;s_60th_Birthday" title="wikilink">Mickey's 60th Birthday</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Magical_World_of_Disney" title="wikilink">The Magical World of Disney</a></em> 's Disneyland 35th Anniversaray Special, in which Woody recounts an adventure his young self had on The Haunted Mansion. The <a href="Title_sequence" title="wikilink">opening sequence</a> and theme song has become iconic of the series, leading to <a href="parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">parody</a> such as on <em>The Simpsons</em>' episode &quot;<a href="Flaming_Moe&#39;s" title="wikilink">Flaming Moe's</a>&quot;. The Simpsons series as also used &quot;Cheers&quot; Opening sequence in the couch gag of the eleventh episode of the twentieth season, along with other famous sitcoms.</p>

In addition, the main patient treated was fictional <em>Cheers</em> writer &quot;Charles James&quot;, a mixture of <em>Cheers</em> creators James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles. The episode makes repeated comments about these &quot;traditional&quot; sitcoms and ends with the opening notes of the <em>Cheers</em> theme playing while <a href="John_Dorian" title="wikilink">J.D.</a> says &quot;Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <em><a href="Seinfeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seinfeld</a></em> episode &quot;The Ticket&quot;, Ted Danson's salary per episode of <em>Cheers</em> comes up as a point of debate between Jerry and George. Additionally, George Wendt appears as himself on a talk show in the episode &quot;<a href="The_Trip_(Seinfeld)" title="wikilink">The Trip</a>.&quot; George Costanza gives him advice on how to improve &quot;Cheers&quot;, but George Wendt makes fun of him for it on the air.</p>

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>Cheers was perhaps the first major non-science fiction TV series to have an important licensing campaign since <em><a href="I_Love_Lucy" title="wikilink">I Love Lucy</a></em>. The show lent itself naturally to the development of &quot;Cheers&quot; bar-related merchandise, culminating in the development of a chain of &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs. Paramount's licensing group, led by <a href="Tom_McGrath" title="wikilink">Tom McGrath</a>, developed the &quot;Cheers&quot; pub concept initially in partnership with Host Marriott which placed &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs in 24+ airports around the world. Boston boasts the original Cheers bar, historically known to generations of Boston insiders as the <em>Bull and Finch</em>, as well as a Cheers restaurant in the Faneuil Hall marketplace and <em>Sam's Place</em>, a spin-off sports bar concept also located at Faneuil Hall. The theme song to the show was licensed to a Canadian restaurant, <a href="Kelsey&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kelsey's</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="syndication-and-home-video">Syndication and home video</h2>
<p><em>Cheers</em> grew in popularity as it aired on American television and entered into syndication. When the show went off the air in 1993, <em>Cheers</em> was syndicated in 38 countries with 179 American television markets and 83 million viewers.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Then, after going off the air,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <em>Cheers</em> entered a long, successful, and continuing syndication run<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> on <em><a href="Nick_at_Nite" title="wikilink">Nick at Nite</a></em>. While the quality of some earlier footage of <em>Cheers</em> had begun to degrade, it underwent a careful restoration in 2001 due to its continued success.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Notably, a <em>Cheers</em> rerun replaced <em><a href="Australia&#39;s_Naughtiest_Home_Videos" title="wikilink">Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos</a></em> on Australia's <a href="Nine_Network" title="wikilink">Nine Network</a>. The latter was cancelled mid-episode on its only broadcast by <a href="Kerry_Packer" title="wikilink">Kerry Packer</a>, who pulled the plug after a phone call. <em>Cheers</em> was aired by <a href="NCRV" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCRV</a> in the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>.

<p>Kelsey Grammer was arguably the most successful with his spin-off <em><a href="Frasier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frasier</a></em>, which lasted for the same eleven-season run <em>Cheers</em> had, as well as a recurring guest role on <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> as <a href="Sideshow_Bob" title="wikilink">Sideshow Bob</a>. By the final season of <em>Frasier</em>, Grammer had become the highest paid actor on television,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> earning about <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>1.6 million an episode. Woody Harrelson has also had a successful career following <em>Cheers</em>, including appearances in a number of notable films that have established him as a box-office draw, such as <em><a href="White_Men_Can&#39;t_Jump" title="wikilink">White Men Can't Jump</a></em>, <em><a href="Indecent_Proposal" title="wikilink">Indecent Proposal</a></em>, <em><a href="Kingpin_(film)" title="wikilink">Kingpin</a></em> and <em><a href="No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)" title="wikilink">No Country for Old Men</a></em>. He also earned an <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> nomination in 1997 for <em><a href="The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt" title="wikilink">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a></em>.</p>
<p>Ted Danson, who had been the highest paid <em>Cheers</em> cast member earning $450,000 an episode in the final season,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> has starred in the successful sitcom <em><a href="Becker_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Becker</a></em> as well as the unsuccessful sitcoms <em><a href="Ink_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Ink</a></em> and <em><a href="Help_Me_Help_You" title="wikilink">Help Me Help You</a></em> and currently appears in the successful drama series <em><a href="Damages_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Damages</a></em>. He has starred in a number of movies, including <em><a href="Cousins_(film)" title="wikilink">Cousins</a></em>, <em><a href="Three_Men_and_a_Baby" title="wikilink">Three Men and a Baby</a></em> and <em><a href="Made_in_America_(film)" title="wikilink">Made in America</a></em>. Ted and his wife (actress <a href="Mary_Steenburgen" title="wikilink">Mary Steenburgen</a>) regularly play themselves on <em><a href="Curb_Your_Enthusiasm" title="wikilink">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em> as Larry David's friends.</p>
<p>John Ratzenberger has voice acted in all of <a href="Pixar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pixar</a>'s <a href="computer_animation" title="wikilink">computer-animated</a> feature films and currently hosts the <a href="Travel_Channel" title="wikilink">Travel Channel</a> show <em><a href="John_Ratzenberger&#39;s_Made_in_America" title="wikilink">Made in America</a></em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On <em>Made in America</em> he travels around the U.S. showing the stories of small towns and the goods they produce. Coincidentally, Ted Danson starred in a film also called <em><a href="Made_in_America_(film)" title="wikilink">Made in America</a></em>. Ratzenberger is heavily involved in a charity known as the Nuts, Bolts and Thingamajigs Foundation,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> which encourages children to get involved with tinkering and mechanical work, as well as to encourage schools to resurrect Industrial Arts programs. He also was on <em><a href="Dancing_with_the_Stars" title="wikilink">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>.</p>
<p>Bebe Neuwirth has gone on to star in numerous <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway musicals</a>, most notably <a href="Chicago_(musical)#Broadway_revival" title="wikilink">the mid-90's <em>Chicago</em> revival</a>, earning two <a href="Tony_Award" title="wikilink">Tony Awards</a> for her work, and co-star in numerous successful films. She also did voice work for <em><a href="All_Dogs_Go_to_Heaven_2" title="wikilink">All Dogs Go to Heaven 2</a></em> and <em><a href="All_Dogs_Go_to_Heaven:_The_Series" title="wikilink">All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series</a></em>.</p>
<p>Kirstie Alley starred in the TV series <em><a href="Veronica&#39;s_Closet" title="wikilink">Veronica's Closet</a></em> as well as numerous <a href="miniseries" class="uri" title="wikilink">miniseries</a> and film roles.</p>
<p>Although some believe Shelley Long leaving the show was a bad career move,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> she has gone on to star in several television and film roles, notably <em><a href="The_Brady_Bunch_Movie" title="wikilink">The Brady Bunch Movie</a></em> and its sequels.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing careers after <em>Cheers</em>, some of the cast members have had personal problems. In 2004, Shelley Long grew <a href="Clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depressed</a> after divorcing her husband of 23 years and appears to have attempted suicide by overdosing on drugs.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Kirstie Alley gained a significant amount of weight after <em>Cheers</em>, which somewhat affected her career. She went on to write and star in a sitcom partly based on her life and weight gain, <em><a href="Fat_Actress" title="wikilink">Fat Actress</a></em>. She formerly was a spokeswoman for <a href="Jenny_Craig" title="wikilink">Jenny Craig</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Host_Marriott_Corporation" title="wikilink">Host Marriott Corporation</a> installed 46 bars modeled after <em>Cheers</em> in their hotel and airport lounges.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> licensed the characters and details of the show, allowing the bars to have fake memorabilia such as Sam Malone's supposed jersey while playing for the Red Sox. Among the details Marriott included were two robots, &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Hank&quot;, one of which was heavy (resembling <a href="Norm_Peterson" title="wikilink">Norm Peterson</a>), with the other wearing a postal uniform (<a href="Cliff_Clavin" title="wikilink">Cliff Clavin</a>).<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Ratzenberger and Wendt filed a groundbreaking <a href="lawsuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawsuit</a> against Paramount in 1993 (around the time that <a href="Viacom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viacom</a> purchased Paramount), claiming that the company was illegally licensing and earning off their images without their permission.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Ratzenberger and Wendt claimed that Paramount could not earn off their images simply because the robots are dressed like the characters over which Paramount still holds rights. The case was dismissed by a <a href="Superior_court" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Superior Court</a> judge in 1996,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> though a <a href="United_States_federal_judge" title="wikilink">federal judge</a> reinstated the case in the Los Angeles court. Paramount tried to bring the case before the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> but the court refused to hear the case, instead merely reaffirming the ruling to reinstate the case in the Superior Court.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Some believe the case could have had significant implications in <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>, as its outcome would have determined whether rights over a character imply rights to reproduce the actor's image with or without his or her permission, so long as the image is of the actor as the character. Rather, Paramount settled with the two before a ruling in the suit was delivered.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="outside-the-bar">Outside the bar</h3>
<p>The first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar. (The first location outside the bar ever seen was Diane's apartment.) When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were actually of the <a href="Bull_&amp;_Finch_Pub" title="wikilink">Bull &amp; Finch Pub</a>, located directly north of the <a href="Public_Garden_(Boston,_Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Boston Public Garden</a>, which has become a <a href="tourist_attraction" title="wikilink">tourist attraction</a> because of its association with the series and draws in nearly a million visitors annually.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> though its interior is different from the TV bar. To further capitalize on the show's popularity, another bar, Cheers Faneuil Hall,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> was built to be a replica of the show's set to provide tourists with a bar whose interior was closer to the one they saw on TV. It is near <a href="Faneuil_Hall" title="wikilink">Faneuil Hall</a>, about a mile from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. The official Cheers site is <a href="http://www.cheersboston.com">www.cheersboston.com</a>. In 1997 Europe's first officially licensed Cheers bar opened in London's Regent's Street W1.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is an exact replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members <a href="George_Wendt" title="wikilink">George Wendt</a> and <a href="John_Ratzenberger" title="wikilink">John Ratzenberger</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The actual bar set was on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum until the museum&lt;U+2019&gt;s closing in early 2006.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
