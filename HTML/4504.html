<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>It is currently unkown when the Quartermaster Award was introduced, however the first recorded Quartermaster was in May 1929. On December 12, 1930, the Quartermaster badge was approved by the National Executive board. It cost 3.00$ Extensive changes to Advancement requirements were made in October 1938 by the National Sea scouting Committee. On September 1, 1949 Sea Exploring was created. The only change in name was from Sea Scouts to Sea Explorers, or Quartermaster Explorers. In 1962 there are 26,751 registered Sea Explorers, and 124 achieved the rank of Quartermaster in that year. In 1966 there are 18,210 registered Sea Explorers, and 82 achieved the rank of Quartermaster in that year.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Current statistics for Sea Scouts who earn Quartermaster are not published, however probably less are earned that the years that were published.</p>
