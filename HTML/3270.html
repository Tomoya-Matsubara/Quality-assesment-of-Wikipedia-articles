<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><em>The Bellingham Herald</em> began publication on March 10, 1890 as the tri-weekly <em>Fairhaven Herald</em>. <em>The Herald</em> went through many changes in its early years, including temporary suspension and a merger with a competing weekly. In 1900, the newspaper purchased the first linotype on the West Coast. When neighboring communities of <a href="Sehome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sehome</a>, <a href="Whatcom_County" title="wikilink">Whatcom</a> and <a href="Fairhaven,_Washington" title="wikilink">Fairhaven</a> consolidated into the city of Bellingham in 1903, the paper was first printed as <em>The Bellingham Herald</em>.</p>
<p>There were many who filled the roles of publisher and editor over the years but perhaps the most notable was the Sefrit-Carver team under the ownership of Sidney Albert &quot;Sam&quot; Perkins, which began in 1911 and lasted into the 1950s. <a href="Federated_Publications" title="wikilink">Federated Publications</a> bought <em>The Herald</em> in 1967. In 1971 Federated Publications merged with <a href="Gannett_Corporation" title="wikilink">Gannett Corporation</a>. <em>The Herald</em> switched to morning delivery in May 1997. <a href="Knight_Ridder" title="wikilink">Knight Ridder</a> acquired <em>The Bellingham Herald</em> in 2005. Knight Ridder was purchased by McClatchy in 2006. On September 23, 2010 Mark Owings was named the new Publisher of the Herald. Owings had been Finance Director since 2004 and a Herald employee for 12 years before being named to his new position.</p>

<p><img src="Bellingham-TH.jpg" title="fig:The Herald Building in downtown Bellingham" alt="The Herald Building in downtown Bellingham" /> The Herald Building is centrally located in downtown Bellingham on the corner of State and Chestnut Street. The building, built in 1926 as an eight-story office building, houses <em>The Bellingham Herald</em>'s main offices on the first and second floors. Tenant businesses occupy the upper floors. The lit sign on top of the Herald was used as a navigation aid for many years for sailors. Morse Hardware had a similar sign saying &quot;MORSE&quot; on top of it for decades - and boaters would use the two signs at night for navigation.</p>
