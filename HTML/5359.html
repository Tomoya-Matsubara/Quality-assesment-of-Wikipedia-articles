<p><strong><em>Enter the Grave</em></strong> is the debut album by the English <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Evile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Evile</a>. Released on August 27, 2007 in Europe and on September 25 in North America and Japan, the album received generally favorable critical reviews and entered the <a href="UK_Rock_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Rock Chart</a> at number 33. It was produced by <a href="Flemming_Rasmussen" title="wikilink">Flemming Rasmussen</a> and recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark. Rasmussen had earlier produced three <a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a> albums, and some journalists commented on his role.</p>
<p>The track &quot;Thrasher&quot; was part of the <em>Earache Thrash Pack</em>, downloadable content made available on March 18, 2008 for the music video console game <em><a href="Rock_Band" title="wikilink">Rock Band</a></em>. The album's lyrics were inspired by films, as well as topics such as a serial killer, <a href="Elizabeth_B&lt;U+00E1&gt;thory" title="wikilink">Countess Bathory</a> and <a href="Witch-hunt" title="wikilink">witch burnings</a>. <em>Enter the Grave</em> was re-released as a limited-edition &quot;redux&quot; version on October 13, 2008 in Europe and on October 28 in North America.</p>
<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
<p>On October 18, 2006, <a href="Earache_Records" title="wikilink">Earache Records</a> announced that it had signed a record contract with Evile.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Looking for a producer for their debut album, the band decided to send a request by email to producer <a href="Flemming_Rasmussen" title="wikilink">Flemming Rasmussen</a> &quot;for a laugh&quot;; Rasmussen was well known and had produced three Metallica albums; 1984's <em><a href="Ride_the_Lightning" title="wikilink">Ride the Lightning</a></em>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> 1986's <em><a href="Master_of_Puppets" title="wikilink">Master of Puppets</a></em>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and 1988's <em><a href="...And_Justice_for_All_(album)" title="wikilink">...And Justice for All</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake googled Rasmussen's name, and the first result returned was the producer's official website. Drake emailed Rasmussen asking if he would be interested.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The producer replied a few days later, asking &quot;Send me some of the tracks over&quot;. Drake emailed a number of mp3, but Rasmussen did not reply, leading Drake to worry that the producer &quot;hated them, and thought they were shit.&quot; Earache Records subsequently emailed Rasmussen to formally ask if he would produce Evile's debut album, to which Rasmussen replied, &quot;Yes&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On March 12, 2007, his involvement was made public.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Pre-production with Rasmussen began on April 28-29 at Evile's <a href="Huddersfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huddersfield</a>, <a href="West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Yorkshire</a> rehearsal space. Soon after the band performed a live set at Tottenham Court Road, London's <a href="Fopp_(retailer)" title="wikilink">Fopp</a> store, which Rasmussen attended to observe Evile's live sound, and &quot;further gain a feel&quot; for the group's music.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The album was recorded and mixed at Sweet Silence Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark. <em>Enter the Grave</em> was produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by Rasmussen, who also supplied additional backing vocals to title track &quot;Enter the Grave&quot;. Anders H. Mortensen, meanwhile, acted as assistant engineer.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Photographs taken during the album's recording sessions were posted at Evile's official <a href="MySpace" class="uri" title="wikilink">MySpace</a> blog,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> where fans were also invited to ask the band's members questions about the recording process for <em>Enter the Grave</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>In turn, Evile's guitarists went into a room where another person sat with a microphone, ready to capture the sound. From the control room, Rasmussen would say &quot;Right, play something&quot;. The respective guitarist would play his instrument, to which Rasmussen would respond &quot;Right, move it left&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Moving the guitar left, the respective guitarist would play again, Rasmussen replying with &quot;Move it right. Alright, leave it there. Don't touch it&quot;. The respective guitarist would leave his instrument in that position, and the &quot;record&quot; button would be pressed. From there, the musician in question would play his parts.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A <a href="Mesa_Boogie#Rectifier_Series" title="wikilink">Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier</a> amplifier was tested alongside a <a href="Marshall_Amplification" title="wikilink">Marshall</a> amplifier, but according to Drake, &quot;the Mesa (sound) was nowhere near as good&quot;. Evile chose to record <em>Enter the Grave</em>'s guitar parts using a Marshall amplifier, and spent &quot;roughly ten minutes&quot; attempting to achieve &quot;a decent sound&quot;. &quot;A bit longer&quot; was spent testing the drums so that a &quot;nice&quot; sound could be achieved, and so that the drums could be tuned.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By June 5, recording for <em>Enter the Grave</em> had been completed, and Rasmussen had begun mixing the album.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Video footage shot during recording sessions was uploaded to Earache Records' official YouTube account on July 4, providing an exclusive glimpse behind the scenes.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In reviewing <em>Enter the Grave</em>, some journalists commented on Rasmussen's role as producer. Chris Kee of <em><a href="Zero_Tolerance_Magazine" title="wikilink">Zero Tolerance Magazine</a></em> said that &quot;getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [Enter the Grave] is a major coup and as you'd expect he's done a sterling job, these fine songs all being blessed with a clean, crisp, uncluttered sound&quot;,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> whereas Ian Webster of <em><a href="Terrorizer_Magazine" title="wikilink">Terrorizer</a></em> felt that &quot;booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is one hell of a statement of intent from Earache.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Eduardo Rivadavia of <em><a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a></em> also commented on Rasmussen's involvement, declaring that his production &quot;is surely one large reason why the album is characterized by a distinctively crunchy, rhythmically airtight attack.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="marketing-and-promotion">Marketing and promotion</h2>
<p>Earache released a six-CD collection entitled <em>Metal: A Headbanger's Companion</em> on April 23, 2007, its third disc including a demo version of title track &quot;Enter the Grave&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Six days later, following a pre-production session, Evile performed a live set at Tottenham Court Road, London's Fopp store.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> &quot;Enter the Grave&quot;, &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;Armoured Assault&quot; were made available for streaming on the group's official website on June 25.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> &quot;Enter the Grave&quot; was further included on a Earache summer sampler CD given out free with the August 2007 issue of <a href="Decibel_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Decibel magazine</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Those who pre-ordered <em>Enter the Grave</em> from Earache's webstore were sent an exclusive red 7&quot; single vinyl, along with a free Evile poster. The vinyl was limited to a thousand copies, and featured two unreleased demo tracks entitled &quot;Darkness Shall Bring Death&quot; and &quot;Sacrificial&quot;. The 7&quot; single was also available to purchase from selected independent retailers.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> On the day of the album's release outside of North America and Japan, Evile performed an in-store show at Manchester's <a href="Virgin_Megastore" title="wikilink">Virgin Megastore</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Released in Europe and North America on January 21, 2008 and February 5 respectively by Earache Records, the song &quot;Thrasher&quot; surfaced on the compilation <em>Thrashing Like A Maniac</em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> &quot;Thrasher&quot; was also part of the <em>Earache Thrash Pack</em>, downloadable content made available on March 18 for the music video console game <a href="Rock_Band" title="wikilink">Rock Band</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> With producer Dan Fernbach of Static Films, Evile filmed a music video for the track on August 28 in South London.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="lyrical-themes">Lyrical themes</h2>
<p><em>Enter the Grave</em>s liner notes credit Evile as a whole for having written the album's lyrics.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In discussing his lyrical contributions during an October 2007 interview, lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake said that he was &quot;really inspired by films&quot;; &quot;First Blood&quot;'s lyrics were inspired by the <a href="First_Blood" title="wikilink">1982 film</a> of the same name, whereas &quot;We Who Are About to Die&quot;'s lyrics were inspired by the 2000 epic <em><a href="Gladiator_(2000_film)" title="wikilink">Gladiator</a></em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Inspired by an urban legend about <a href="Elizabeth_B&lt;U+00E1&gt;thory" title="wikilink">Countess Bathory</a>, the lyrics for &quot;Bathe In Blood&quot; were written by Drake while Evile were recording at Sweet Silence Studios - after penning the track's lyrics, he thought he &quot;had gone too far&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> &quot;Burned Alive&quot;, meanwhile, was about burning witches; reading about witches and &quot;how they were dealt with in olden times&quot;, Drake &quot;thought it might be interesting to add a devilish slant to it&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Inspired by what he read, Drake wrote about burned witches going to Hell, returning, and then killing everyone.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Drake also wrote the lyrics to title track &quot;Enter the Grave&quot;, and &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> the former being about a serial killer.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Written by bassist Mike Alexander, the lyrics to &quot;Armoured Assault&quot; describe a giant tank war machine.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Alexander wrote &quot;Killer From the Deep&quot;'s lyrics as well, which Drake thinks might've been inspired by 1975 thriller <em><a href="Jaws_(film)" title="wikilink">Jaws</a></em>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Drummer Ben Carter contributed lyrics for <em>Enter the Grave</em>, writing the lyrics to &quot;Man Against Machine&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Eduardo Rivadavia of <em><a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a></em> felt that the album's lyrics were characterized by &quot;splatter-demonic lyrics, reminiscent of <a href="Bay_Area_thrash_metal" title="wikilink">Bay Area</a> staples like <a href="Exodus_(band)" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> and <a href="Forbidden_(band)" title="wikilink">Forbidden</a> -- even early <a href="Slayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slayer</a> for brief, exceptionally inspired moments.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <em><a href="Metal_Maniacs" title="wikilink">Metal Maniacs</a></em>' Kevin Stewart-Panko commented that <em>Enter the Grave</em> contained &quot;songs about such need-to-know topics as John Rambo (&quot;First Blood&quot;), sharks (&quot;Killer From the Deep&quot;) and, umm, thrash (&quot;Thrasher&quot;) abound in all their escapist ridiculousness.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>
<p>Originally scheduled for issue in early 2007,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <em>Enter the Grave</em> was released outside of North America and Japan on August 27, 2007 by <a href="Earache_Records" title="wikilink">Earache Records</a> and debuted at number 33 on the <a href="UK_Rock_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Rock Chart</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Released in North America and Japan almost one month later on September 25 by Earache Records and Howling Bull Records respectively,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> the album sold 200 copies in the United States during its first week of release.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> It's Japanese edition included the bonus demo tracks &quot;Darkness Shall Bring Death&quot; and &quot;Sacrificial&quot;, both of which were also available as an exclusive red 7&quot; single vinyl.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> A limited-edition &quot;redux&quot; version of the album was issued on October 13 in Europe and on October 28 in North America, housed in a slipcase. This re-release included three bonus tracks, an <em>Enter the Grave</em> patch, a guitar pick, and a two-hour DVD including the entire full-length played live in rehearsal, live footage from Evile's February 2008 European tour with <a href="Megadeth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megadeth</a>, band interviews, and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the group on the road.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing mostly favourable reviews of the album, many journalists referenced eighties thrash groups, particularly Exodus, Slayer and <a href="Testament_(band)" title="wikilink">Testament</a>. Awarding the album eight out of ten stars, Dom Lawson of <em><a href="Classic_Rock_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Classic Rock</a></em> described <em>Enter the Grave</em> as &quot;a monstrous, life-affirming metal album that craftily welds misty-eyed nostalgia for the glory days of Exodus, Testament and <a href="Arise_(Sepultura_album)" title="wikilink">Arise</a>-era <a href="Sepultura" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sepultura</a> to contemporary sonic values&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <em><a href="Rock_Sound" title="wikilink">Rock Sound</a></em> writer Ronnie Kerswell observed that &quot;title track &quot;Enter the Grave&quot; nods towards Slayer's classic &quot;<a href="Angel_of_Death_(song)" title="wikilink">Angel of Death</a>&quot;&quot;, and summarized by calling the full-length &quot;old school as fuck&quot;, while awarding <em>Enter the Grave</em> eight out of ten stars.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Dave Ling of <em><a href="Metal_Hammer" title="wikilink">Metal Hammer</a></em> gave the album eight out of ten stars as well, feeling that &quot;with the galloping likes of &quot;Bathe In Blood&quot;, &quot;Thrasher&quot; and &quot;First Blood&quot;, Evile have fulfilled their side of the deal&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Chris Kee of <em><a href="Zero_Tolerance_Magazine" title="wikilink">Zero Tolerance Magazine</a></em> noted that &quot;the influences are easy to spot - <a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a>, Exodus, Testament, Forbidden, <a href="Laaz_Rockit" title="wikilink">Laaz Rockit</a>, Slayer&quot;, but still called <em>Enter the Grave</em> as &quot;a triumph, a resounding war cry from the spearhead of the new UK thrash assault&quot;, awarding four and a half out of five stars.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Ian Webster of wrote that &quot;&quot;First Blood&quot; is ultra-Exodus and goes head to head with the Slayer attack of &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;Armoured Assault&quot;&quot;, and hailed the album as &quot;the best UK thrash debut since <a href="Sabbat_(band)" title="wikilink">Sabbat</a>'s <em><a href="History_of_a_Time_to_Come" title="wikilink">History of a Time to Come</a></em>&quot;, awarding nine out of ten stars.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Giving <em>Enter the Grave</em> four out of five stars, <em><a href="Kerrang!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerrang!</a></em>'s James Hoare commented that the album was &quot;honed on a steady diet of early Slayer, <a href="Sacred_Reich" title="wikilink">Sacred Reich</a> and <a href="Nuclear_Assault" title="wikilink">Nuclear Assault</a>&quot;, summarizing the full-length as &quot;an absolute hair-swirling, air-punching beast&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <em>Terrorizer</em> dubbed <em>Enter the Grave</em> the nineteenth best album of 2007,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> whereas <em>Classic Rock</em> rated the full-length the thirty-eighth best album of 2007.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
