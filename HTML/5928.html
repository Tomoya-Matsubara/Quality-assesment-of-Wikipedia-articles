<p><strong>Royce Middlebrook &quot;Ross&quot; Youngs</strong> (April 10, 1897Â &lt;U+2013&gt; October 22, 1927) was a <a href="professional_baseball" title="wikilink">professional baseball</a> player. Nicknamed &quot;Pep&quot;, he played ten seasons in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> for the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> from 1917 through 1926, playing <a href="right_fielder" title="wikilink">right field</a> almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the Giants teams that won four consecutive <a href="List_of_National_League_pennant_winners" title="wikilink">National League pennants</a> and the <a href="1921_World_Series" title="wikilink">1921</a> and <a href="1922_World_Series" title="wikilink">1922 World Series</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="Shiner,_Texas" title="wikilink">Shiner, Texas</a>, Youngs excelled at baseball and <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> at the <a href="West_Texas_Military_Institute" title="wikilink">West Texas Military Institute</a>. After beginning his professional career in <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a>, the Giants signed him in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> with the Giants and batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the age of 30 of <a href="Bright&#39;s_Disease" title="wikilink">Bright's Disease</a>.</p>
<p>Known for his defense and hitting, he was elected to the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1972 by the <a href="Veterans_Committee" title="wikilink">Veterans Committee</a>. His election was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee.</p>
