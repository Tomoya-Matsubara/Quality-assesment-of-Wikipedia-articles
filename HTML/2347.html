<p>Maria Magdalena Laubser was born on the wheat farm <em>Bloublommetjieskloof</em> near <a href="Malmesbury,_Western_Cape" title="wikilink">Malmesbury</a> in the <a href="Swartland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swartland</a>, a productive agricultural area in South Africa.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> She was the eldest of six children of Gerhardus Petrus Christiaan Laubser and Johanna Catharina Laubser (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Holm).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Laubser's youth was dominated by the rural and pastoral and she delighted in this carefree existence.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <img src="Maggie_Laubser,_Still_Life_Flowers_in_Vase,_(1909&lt;U+2013&gt;1913),_oil_on_canvas,_520_x_420_mm.jpg" title="fig:Still Life: Flowers in a Vase (1909-1913), oil on canvas, 520 x 420 mm, Sanlam Art Collection" alt="Still Life: Flowers in a Vase (1909-1913), oil on canvas, 520 x 420 mm, Sanlam Art Collection" /> After attending the farm school Rocklands,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> she left for boarding school at Bloemhof Seminary, <a href="Stellenbosch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stellenbosch</a>, where she was introduced to the art of drawing.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She returned to the farm in 1901, and during a visit to <a href="Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Cape Town</a> she met <a href="Beatrice_Hazel" title="wikilink">Beatrice Hazel</a>, a realistic <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">romantic</a> style painter, who introduced her to <a href="Edward_Roworth" title="wikilink">Edward Roworth</a>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> giving impetus to her desire to study painting.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1903 she convinced her parents to let her go to Cape Town once a week for singing lessons. The difficulty of travel and the low opinion her mother had of her mezzo-soprano voice discouraged her, but it was at this stage that she started painting on her own.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>She studied painting under Roworth in Cape Town for two months of 1903, during which time she received a silver medal for her work.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By 1907 she had become proficient enough to be elected to the <a href="South_African_Society_of_Artists" title="wikilink">South African Society of Artists</a> (SASA)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and, in 1909, she was represented at the annual exhibition of the SASA and the <a href="Fine_Arts_Association_of_Cape_Town" title="wikilink">Fine Arts Association of Cape Town</a>.

<p>During a 1912 visit to her nephew, Gert Coetzee, in <a href="Pretoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pretoria</a>, she took up employment as a governess on a farm owned by the Wolmarans family in <a href="Ermelo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ermelo</a> district, <a href="Transvaal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transvaal</a>, where she also taught art and needlework. While on vacation in <a href="Durban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durban</a> with a friend, Sophie Fisher, she befriended <a href="Jan_Hendrik_Arnold_Balw&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Jan Hendrik Arnold Balw&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> (Consul for the Netherlands in Durban 1903-1913), a shipping-line owner who offered to finance her and her sister Hannah's studies abroad.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>J. H. A.
