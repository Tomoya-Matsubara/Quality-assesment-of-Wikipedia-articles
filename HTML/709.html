<p>The wreck has given archaeologists two major discoveries: the biggest single collection of <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang Dynasty</a> artefacts found in one location, the so called &quot;Tang Treasure&quot;; and the Arabian dhow, which gives a new insight into the trade routes between China and the Middle East during that period. The treasure has been kept as one collection and, during the excavation, the efforts to preserve the integrity of the site and its cargo have resulted in detailed archaeological evidence. This evidence has given new insight into the construction methods used in shipbuilding, and the items and style of artefacts has revealed previously unknown facts about the trade between the two areas.</p>

<h3 id="route">Route</h3>
<p>It is unclear why the ship was so far from its expected route (shown in red on the map to the right),<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> as most ships leaving China for Arabia would have sailed through the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a>. They would then turn north-west after passing southern <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>, continuing through the <a href="Singapore_Strait" title="wikilink">Singapore Strait</a> into the <a href="Straits_of_Malacca" title="wikilink">Straits of Malacca</a> between <a href="Peninsular_Malaysia" title="wikilink">Peninsular Malaysia</a> and <a href="Sumatra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumatra</a>. Belitung is some distance from this route, and it is unclear how the vessel came to be in this area. Belitung is to the south-east of the Singapore Strait by , and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling from the <a href="Java_Sea" title="wikilink">Java Sea</a>, which is south of Belitung Island, to the Straits of Malacca  north of the Island.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Sur-Dhow_(4).JPG" title="fig:The shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one, in Oman." alt="The shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one, in Oman." width="240" /> The shipwrecked dhow was approximately  wide and  long<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and is remarkable for two reasons; it is the first ancient Arabian ship to be found and excavated,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and its planks were sewn together using a thin rope made of <a href="Coir" title="wikilink">coconut fibresrather</a> than using the more traditional methods of pegs or nails used in Arabia in later centuries.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The wreck timbers were found under a sediment that preserved the remains of the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to <a href="marine_worm" title="wikilink">marine worms</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed&lt;U+2014&gt;something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Pieces of the original timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some of the <a href="Belitung_shipwreck#Wood_types" title="wikilink">types of wood</a> used. It is possible that the ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction-techniques">Construction techniques</h3>
<p>The ship was constructed around a  long <a href="Boat_building#Parts" title="wikilink">keel</a> of  thickness, which is believed to have survived intact.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The front of the ship had a 61&lt;U+00B0&gt; <a href="Rake_(angle)" title="wikilink">angle of rake</a> at the <a href="Bow_(ship)" title="wikilink">bow</a> where the <a href="Boat_building#Parts" title="wikilink">stem post</a> was joined to the keel with <a href="mortise_and_tenon" title="wikilink">mortise and tenon</a> joints and secured with  diameter rope.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The hull planks were stitched onto the <a href="Hull_(watercraft)" title="wikilink">frames</a> and keel through holes spaced at  intervals.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The boat had a <a href="keelson" class="uri" title="wikilink">keelson</a> for added strength, which rested on the half-frames.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Michael Flecker, the chief excavating archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship to three types of the same period and concluded that the wreck most resembled &quot;lashed-lug&quot; ships of south-east Asia&lt;U+2014&gt;first used in the 5th century.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the Red Sea, on the Indian coast, and as far as the Maldives.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He notes that Roman references by <a href="Procopius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procopius</a> in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in &quot;Indian Seas&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Though Arabian ships of this type have not been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-Tang <em>Ling biao lu yi</em> (&quot;Strange Things Noted in the South&quot;). According to John Guy, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book &quot;describes the ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with the fiber of coir-palms and having their seams caulked rather than using iron nails to secure their planks&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wood-types">Wood types</h3>
<p>Samples of wood from the shipwreck were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products division of the <a href="Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) in Australia.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>There are many types of wood that have been positively identified: teak (<em><a href="Tectona_grandis" title="wikilink">Tectona grandis</a></em>) was used for the through-beams and is resilient to the <a href="Shipworm" title="wikilink">teredo worm</a> (the Teredinidae family), the ceiling was made from a <em><a href="Cupressus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cupressus</a></em> genus which was possibly <em><a href="Cupressus_torulosa" title="wikilink">Cupressus torulosa</a></em>, the stem-post is made of <a href="rosewood" class="uri" title="wikilink">rosewood</a> from the <a href="Fabaceae" title="wikilink">Leguminosae</a> family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the <em><a href="Dalbergia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalbergia</a></em> or <em><a href="Pterocarpus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pterocarpus</a></em> genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an <em><a href="Artocarpus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artocarpus</a></em> genus of the <a href="Moraceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moraceae</a> family, more commonly known as the <a href="Mulberry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mulberry</a> family.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The species used for the hull planks was not positively identified but is thought to be <em><a href="Amoora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amoora</a></em> of the <a href="Meliaceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meliaceae</a> family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of <em>Amoora</em> or of the <em><a href="Afzelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afzelia</a></em> genus of the Fabaceae family.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <em>Afzelia</em> is interesting in that the three main species <em><a href="Afzelia_africana" title="wikilink">A. africana</a></em>, <em><a href="Afzelia_bipindensis" title="wikilink">A. bipindensis</a></em> and <em><a href="Afzelia_pachyloba" title="wikilink">A. pachyloba</a></em> are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the west coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The ship could originally have been said to be of Arabian or Indian origin, as there is little to differentiate between ships of the area during that period, in regard to construction techniques&lt;U+2014&gt;though its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of Africa.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After analysing the hull form, timber species, and construction methods, Ilic concluded that the wreck was of Indian or Arabian origin. India was considered the more probable place of construction but Arabian construction was not ruled out, as the timber used was commonly imported to the Middle East for use in shipbuilding.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Flecker concluded that the wreck was an Arabian ship in his 2010 chapter from the Sackler exhibition catalogue, arguing that &quot;from an analysis of construction methods and materials and hull form, the author has determined that the Belitung wreck is an Arab vessel.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>
<p>Present-day knowledge of the original materials and methods used in construction of this particular Arab dhow stems largely from the shipwreck itself. The <em><a href="Jewel_of_Muscat" title="wikilink">Jewel of Muscat</a></em> reconstruction, a replica made as an exact copy of the wreck, has shown that the ship resembles a <em>baitl qarib</em>, a type of ship still found in Oman today.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Amongst the hull of the shipwreck were large lumps of concretion containing artefacts from the ship's cargo dated to the <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang Dynasty</a> of China around 800 AD, and from where the wreck gets its other names, the &quot;Tang shipwreck&quot; or &quot;Tang treasure ship&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The ship's timbers and artefacts were be shown to the public for the first time in 2011. The world debut exhibition of the collection of artefacts, as well as timbers from the ship, took place in the <a href="ArtScience_Museum" title="wikilink">ArtScience Museum</a>, adjacent to Singapore's <a href="Marina_Bay_Sands" title="wikilink">Marina Bay Sands</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The significance of the discovery of the shipwreck led to the decision to construct the <em>Jewel of Muscat</em> as an exact reconstruction of the shipwrecked dhow.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

According to <em>The New York Times</em>, &quot;a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences &lt;U+2014&gt; including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian&quot; wrote to the head of the Smithsonian Institution, G.Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that &quot;proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution.&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information pertaining to the crew and cargo.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The <em>New York Times</em> article goes on to say that further comments were made by &quot;the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History&quot; all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, &quot;by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian &lt;U+2014&gt; which is a research institution as well as a network of museums &lt;U+2014&gt; would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Proponents of the arguments to display the works claim that the excavation was indeed legal as the work was carried out in accordance with Indonesian law, at the request of the Indonesian government, and in accordance with international laws at the time.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> James P. Delgado, director of maritime heritage at the United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that &quot;allowing any of the finds from an excavation to be sold betrays the most basic aspects of research&quot; with the <em>New York TImes</em> going on to report that, &quot;he [Delgado] wished the Belitung shipwreck had been academically excavated. But unlike some of his colleagues, he said that instead of canceling the exhibition, the Smithsonian could use it to educate the public about the consequences of the commercialization of underwater heritage.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Walterfang has stated that &quot;the overall situation would without doubt be described as 'less than ideal'&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> and that &quot;the Indonesian government, fearful of looting, ordered Seabed Explorations to begin an immediate round-the-clock recovery operation.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="conventions-by-international-organisations">Conventions by international organisations</h3>
<p>The Underwater Archaeology Resolutions that were adopted on 10 September 1993 by the International Congress of Maritime Museums (ICMM) state that:</p>

<p>They also say that, &quot;ICMM members should recognize that artefacts from underwater sites are integral parts of archaeological assemblages, which should remain intact for research and display&quot; and that, &quot;a commercially exploited heritage site is one in which the primary motive for investigation is private financial gain.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage during 15 October &lt;U+2014&gt; 5 November 2001.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Though the rules set out at the meeting do include preserving artefacts <em>in situ</em><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> as the preferable option they go on to say:</p>
