<p><img src="Riverina_NSW.png" title="fig:The Riverina region in relation to New South Wales." alt="The Riverina region in relation to New South Wales." width="350" /> The <strong>Riverina</strong> is an agricultural <a href="List_of_regions_in_Australia" title="wikilink">region</a> of south-western <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> (NSW), <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions due to the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for <a href="irrigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrigation</a>. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. Bordered on the south by the state of <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> and on the east by the <a href="Great_Dividing_Range" title="wikilink">Great Dividing Range</a>, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the <a href="Murray_River" title="wikilink">Murray</a> and <a href="Murrumbidgee_River" title="wikilink">Murrumbidgee</a> drainage zones to their confluence in the west.</p>
<p>Home to <a href="Indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">Aboriginal</a> groups for over 40,000 years, the Riverina was originally settled by <a href="European_ethnic_groups" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> in the mid-19th century as a <a href="grazing" title="wikilink">pastoral</a> region providing <a href="beef" class="uri" title="wikilink">beef</a> and <a href="wool" class="uri" title="wikilink">wool</a> to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as <a href="rice" class="uri" title="wikilink">rice</a> and <a href="List_of_grape_varieties" title="wikilink">wine grapes</a>. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the <a href="federation_of_Australia" title="wikilink">federation of Australian</a> colonies.</p>
<p>Major population and service centres in the Riverina include the cities of <a href="Wagga_Wagga,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Wagga Wagga</a>, <a href="Albury,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Albury</a> and <a href="Griffith,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Griffith</a>. Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of <a href="Charles_Sturt_University" title="wikilink">Charles Sturt University</a>, the only local provider of <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> for the region. Wagga Wagga is home to two major <a href="Australian_Defence_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Defence Force</a> establishments.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>The delineation of the Riverina region by government agencies and other bodies varies, but in common usage it generally comprises the agricultural and <a href="grazing" title="wikilink">pastoral</a> areas of New South Wales, west of the <a href="Great_Dividing_Range" title="wikilink">Great Dividing Range</a> and in the <a href="drainage_basin" title="wikilink">drainage basin</a> of the snow-fed <a href="Murray_River" title="wikilink">Murray</a> and <a href="Murrumbidgee_River" title="wikilink">Murrumbidgee Rivers</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The northern boundary beyond the Riverina is determined by the <a href="Lachlan_River" title="wikilink">Lachlan River</a> catchment area and is referred to as the <a href="Central_West,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Central West</a>. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina borders the state of <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. West of the <a href="confluence_(geography)" title="wikilink">confluence</a> of the Murray and Murrumbidgee is the beginning of the more arid <a href="Far_West,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Far West</a> region.  <img src="BooroorbanNestOldManPlain.JPG" title="fig:|thumb|An eagles nest on The Old Man Plain, an extensive saltbush plain between Hay &amp; Wanganella" alt="|thumb|An eagles nest on The Old Man Plain, an extensive saltbush plain between Hay &amp; Wanganella" /></p>
<p>In general, the Riverina is an <a href="alluvial" class="uri" title="wikilink">alluvial</a> <a href="plain" class="uri" title="wikilink">plain</a> formed by deposition carried from the <a href="Great_Dividing_Range" title="wikilink">Great Dividing Range</a> by streams between 30,000 to 15,000 years ago.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The terrain includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than 200 metres above sea level. The western Riverina consists largely of featureless <a href="saltbush" class="uri" title="wikilink">saltbush</a> plain.</p>
<h3 id="landform-and-hydrology">Landform and hydrology</h3>
<p>The <a href="geology" class="uri" title="wikilink">geology</a> of the Riverina comprises several <a href="trough_(geology)" title="wikilink">troughs</a> and <a href="sedimentary_basin" title="wikilink">sedimentary basins</a>. The western Riverina is presumed to be a continuation of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan <a href="Fold_(geology)" title="wikilink">Fold</a> Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several <a href="mineral" class="uri" title="wikilink">mineral</a> deposit types including <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a>, <a href="petroleum" class="uri" title="wikilink">petroleum</a>, coal seam <a href="methane" class="uri" title="wikilink">methane</a>, <a href="gypsum" class="uri" title="wikilink">gypsum</a>, orogenic gold, <a href="Cobar,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Cobar</a> style <a href="polymetal" title="wikilink">polymetallic</a> systems, heavy <a href="mineral_sands" title="wikilink">mineral sands</a> and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more <a href="soil_salination" title="wikilink">saline</a> grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain.

The Riverina is drained by the large <a href="Murray-Darling_Basin" title="wikilink">Murray-Darling Basin</a>. Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west. As well as the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, other streams include <a href="Billabong_Creek" title="wikilink">Billabong Creek</a> and the <a href="Edward_River" title="wikilink">Edward River</a>, an <a href="anabranch" class="uri" title="wikilink">anabranch</a> of the Murray. Much of the water carried by these streams is diverted. In 2001–2002, 52% of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water runoff was diverted, 77% of which was used for <a href="irrigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrigation</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>The <a href="Bureau_of_Meteorology_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Bureau of Meteorology</a> classify the Riverina in the <em>Hot Dry Zone (with cooler winters)</em> climatic zone. Places in this zone can be very hot in the summer months while in the winter, nights can be very cold.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Mean daily maximum temperatures in the Riverina range from  in January and  in July in <a href="Wagga_Wagga,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Wagga Wagga</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> to  in January and  in July in <a href="Hillston,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Hillston</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Rainfall levels in the Riverina are generally low with the median annual rainfall over most of the region between 250–500 millimetres (mm), rising to between 500–800 mm on the eastern fringe.

The Riverina <a href="bioregion" class="uri" title="wikilink">bioregion</a> is an area of land that comprises part of the larger Riverina area but also extends into Victoria. It has been defined by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service as extending from <a href="Ivanhoe,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Ivanhoe</a> in the Murray Darling Depression Bioregion south to <a href="Bendigo,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Bendigo</a>, and from <a href="Narrandera,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Narrandera</a> in the east to <a href="Balranald,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Balranald</a> in the west. 74.03% of the bioregion is in New South Wales, the remainder in Victoria. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>River channels in the region support River Red Gum (<em><a href="Eucalyptus_camaldulensis" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus camaldulensis</a></em>) and River Cooba (<em><a href="Acacia_stenophylla" title="wikilink">Acacia stenophylla</a></em>) communities. Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (<em><a href="Eucalyptus_largiflorens" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus largiflorens</a></em>) woodlands and a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey. Yellow Box (<em><a href="Eucalyptus_melliodora" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus melliodora</a></em>) and Grey Box (<em><a href="Eucalyptus_microcarpa" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus microcarpa</a></em>) occur along with Cypress Pine (<em><a href="Callitris_glaucophylla" title="wikilink">Callitris glaucophylla</a></em>) on areas rarely subjected to flooding. The area away from the rivers often consists of treeless plains, consisting of various saltbush (<em><a href="Atriplex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atriplex</a></em>) species, Cotton Bush (<em><a href="Maireana_aphylla" title="wikilink">Maireana aphylla</a></em>) and varieties of <em><a href="Danthonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danthonia</a></em> and <em><a href="Austrostipa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austrostipa</a></em> native grasslands.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Significant mammals endemic to forests in the bioregion include various species of glider, such as Sugar Gliders (<em><a href="Petaurus_breviceps" title="wikilink">Petaurus breviceps</a></em>), Feathertail Gliders (<em><a href="Acrobates_pygmaeus" title="wikilink">Acrobates pygmaeus</a></em>) and Squirrel Gliders (<em><a href="Petaurus_norfolcensis" title="wikilink">Petaurus norfolcensis</a></em>) as well as Koalas (<em><a href="Phascolarctos_cinereus" title="wikilink">Phascolarctos cinereus</a></em>) A wide variety of birdlife makes its home in wetlands in the Riverina, including many <a href="Bird_migration" title="wikilink">migratory</a> species. Competition from introduced species and the effect of clearing, grazing and pasture improvement has led to a decline in the diversity of native flora and fauna in the area.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>  </p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><a href="Indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">Aboriginal</a> people are thought to have inhabited the Riverina for at least 40,000 years.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <a href="Wiradjuri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiradjuri</a> people were the original inhabitants of much of south western New South Wales including much of the Riverina region along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Other groups living along the Murrumbidgee included the <a href="Nari-Nari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nari-Nari</a> on the western plains where the towns of <a href="Hay,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Hay</a> and <a href="Balranald,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Balranald</a> would later be founded<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> , the Mudi-Mudi, Gurendji and the Yida-Yida.

<p>The rivers played a leading role in the lifestyle of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. <a href="Murray_cod" title="wikilink">Murray cod</a> and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes.

<h3 id="bushrangers">Bushrangers</h3>
<p>Transport links assisted the development of the Riverina economy, at the same time areas of the region found themselves under threat from robbery and murder by various <a href="bushranger" title="wikilink">bushrangers</a>. Between 1862 and 1865, the eastern Riverina between Wagga Wagga and Albury saw the depredations of <a href="Dan_Morgan_(bushranger)" title="wikilink">Dan &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Morgan</a>. Having previously been convicted of armed robbery, Morgan came to the attention to authorities in the Riverina when he bailed up a police magistrate, Henry Baylis, near <a href="Urana,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Urana</a> in 1863. In 1864, Morgan bailed up Round Hill <a href="sheep_station" title="wikilink">station</a>, a large sheep farm near <a href="Morven,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Morven</a>, killing a station hand. Later that year, the bushranger shot dead a policeman in cold blood near <a href="Tumbarumba,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Tumbarumba</a>. The reward placed on his head reached &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 before, in April 1865, he was shot dead near <a href="Wangaratta,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Wangaratta, Victoria</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>The infamous Australian bushranger, <a href="Ned_Kelly" title="wikilink">Ned Kelly</a>, made possibly his most daring raid in the Riverina, at <a href="Jerilderie,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Jerilderie</a> in 1879. After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly and his gang in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms. Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the <a href="Bank_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bank of New South Wales</a> and hold the town captive for several days. While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a rambling 8,000 word condemnation of the colonial administration in Victoria and specifically the treatment of the <a href="Irish_Australian" title="wikilink">Irish</a>. Being unable to find the local newspaper editor, he left the letter with a member of the bank staff and returned to Victoria &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,000 richer.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="riverina-and-federation">Riverina and Federation</h3>

<p><img src="BerriganFederalHotel.jpg" title="fig:The Federal Hotel in Berrigan, one of a series of hotels built or renamed in the southern Riverina as a result of the Federation campaign" alt="The Federal Hotel in Berrigan, one of a series of hotels built or renamed in the southern Riverina as a result of the Federation campaign" width="250" /> The close geographic and cultural ties between the Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing frustration with inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an <a href="Federation_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Australian federation</a>. This would see the southern Riverina in particular take a leading role in bringing about federation.</p>
<p>Prior to federation, the various Australian colonies could, and often did, charge <a href="tariff" title="wikilink">tariffs</a> on goods from the other colonies, ostensibly for the <a href="Protectionism" title="wikilink">protection</a> of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina, the Murray was, and remains, part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.</p>
<p>In the early 1890s, for mainly patriotic reasons, the <a href="Australian_Natives_Association" title="wikilink">Australian Natives Association</a> helped establish the Federation League, a society dedicated to the creation of a federal nation.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Following a series of addresses by the future <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Edmund_Barton" title="wikilink">Edmund Barton</a> to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> One of these towns, <a href="Corowa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corowa</a>, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, <a href="John_Quick_(politician)" title="wikilink">Dr John Quick</a>, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal <a href="constitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">constitution</a>. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on <a href="1_January" title="wikilink">1 January</a> <a href="1901" class="uri" title="wikilink">1901</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>Development and promotion of the MIA led to large scale settlement on land described by Oxley 100 years earlier as &quot;country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think, have no equal.&quot; Settlers came from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities. In particular, the <a href="Italian_Australian" title="wikilink">Italian</a> community prospered in the Area, owning nearly half of all the farms around Griffith by 1954.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Later, further irrigation was developed for areas in the Murray valley starting with the Wakool Irrigation District in 1932, then the Deniboota and Denimein Irrigation Districts in 1938, the Berriquin Irrigation District in 1939 and the Tullakool Irrigation Area in 1942.
