It is the oldest engineering faculty in <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>. It offers full-time Undergraduate Courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of the Science of Engineering (BSc.Eng.), and several other <a href="Postgraduate_education" title="wikilink">postgraduate degrees</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Efac_Pera_2.JPG" title="fig:Early days of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya" alt="Early days of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya" /> The faculty of engineering has a history of sixty years. But it's roots lie way back in the 19th century. It starts from the development of a Technical School which was founded in Colombo in 1893 to train sub-professional engineering personnel . It was renamed the Ceylon Technical College in 1906. But unfortunately the <a href="British_Ceylon" title="wikilink">colonial authorities</a> did not have a clear policy on technical education, and in consequence the college went through many vicissitudes being nearly downgraded to an <em>Industrial School</em> at one stage.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus, only in 1942 it was able to reach university college rank when it received <em>provisional recognition</em> from the <a href="University_of_London" title="wikilink">University of London</a> to prepare students for the external degree. Due to the prevailing wartime conditions the requirement of an inspection of the teaching facilities was waived.</p>
<p>On 1 July 1942 the <a href="University_of_Ceylon" title="wikilink">University of Ceylon</a>, the first university in the country, was established by the amalgamation of the Ceylon University College and the <a href="Faculty_of_Medicine,_University_of_Colombo" title="wikilink">Ceylon Medical College</a>. At the inception there were four faculties: Arts, Oriental Studies, Science and Medicine. Although the need for <a href="Engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">Engineering</a> was recognized, planning was deferred due to the shortage of funds in the stringent wartime economy. The availability of degree courses at the Ceylon Technical College was also another reason for lowering the priority of engineering. However in December 1949 a crisis erupted at the Ceylon Technical College when the University of London made known its intention of reconsidering the provisional recognition in view of some serious shortcomings in the college. The degree courses were in serious trouble as future recognition appeared to be in doubt. The government responded to the crisis by requesting the University of Ceylon to set up a Faculty of Engineering by 1 July 1950. Ill-prepared though it was, the University accepted the challenge and with this decision the degree courses at the Ceylon Technical College were terminated.</p>
<p>The permanent home of the new Faculty was to be in the residential Campus in Peradeniya, but until the buildings were ready it had to be located in Colombo. For the time being, therefore, it had to make use of the laboratory facilities at the Ceylon Technical College, supplementing them with its own equipment. It had three Departments of study: <a href="Civil_Engineering" title="wikilink">Civil Engineering</a>, <a href="Electrical_Engineering" title="wikilink">Electrical Engineering</a> and <a href="Mechanical_Engineering" title="wikilink">Mechanical Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>The site for the Engineering complex was a 6-hectare block on the left bank of the <a href="Mahaweli_River" title="wikilink">Mahaweli River</a> across which a bridge was built for access to the rest of the Campus. The entire project was planned by the staff of the Faculty and the University architects without any significant expatriate expertise. The laboratories, classrooms, library and other facilities were designed for quick and easy access, and ample provision was made for future expansion. When the project was completed in 1964 the move from Colombo took place. The facilities had a floor area of about 18,500 square meters, and 5,400 square metres have been added since then.</p>
<p>In 1942, when degree courses commenced at the Ceylon Technical College, the number of professional engineers in the country was estimated to be around 210, and 104 graduated in the period 1942-50 when the College had its link with the University of London. On the basis of these figures the intake of freshmen to the Faculty in 1950 was fixed at 25. This figure was steadily increased over the years, reaching 150 in 1964, the year of the move to Peradeniya. On requests from the UGC the intake was raised to 250 in 1978 and to 300 in 1992. From its inception in 1950 to 1971, when a <a href="University_of_Moratuwa" title="wikilink">second Faculty of Engineering</a> was opened at <a href="Moratuwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moratuwa</a>, this Faculty was the only source of supply of graduate engineers in the country. During the period 1950 - 53 when the Faculty undertook the task of completing the instruction of Ceylon Technical College, undergraduates were affected by the termination of the degree courses, 92 graduated with the University of London degree. The University of Ceylon's BSc. Engineering degree was first awarded in 1953, and during the period 1953-93, 5756 students have obtained this degree, including 546 women.</p>

<li>Department of Engineering Mathematics</li>
<li>Department of Mechanical Engineering</li>
<li>Department of Production Engineering</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="admission">Admission</h2>
<p>Almost all the students of the faculty are from <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>. Admission to the faculty of Engineering is subjected to the Sri Lankan government policy of University admission.</p>
<p>Selection of students is done on the basis of merit order on the average Z score obtained by candidates at the <a href="GCE_Advanced_Level_in_Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">GCE Advanced Level</a> examination. District merit criteria is the procedure use to select undergraduates to the faculty. Competition to enter the university is severe.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="undergraduate-studies-in-engineering">Undergraduate Studies in Engineering</h2>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya is one of the three institutes offering full time engineering degrees in the island.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Annual undergraduate entrollment to the engineering faculty is about 420. The Faculty offers a full-time Undergraduate Courses leading to the degree of <a href="Bachelor_of_Engineering" title="wikilink">Bachelor of the Science of Engineering</a> (B.Sc.Eng.). This is of four years duration, the first year being common to all students and the rest devoted to specialisation in on of the branches of engineering. Fields of specialization are determined end of the first year based on students' choices. Preference is given based on each student's standing in the first year examination results. Coursework (laboratory, design and fieldwork) and industrial training form an essential part of the undergraduate course.</p>
<p>Until year 2000 traditional British university education system exsisted where students followed a strict pre-defined curriculum without exceptions. Each year students had to take five to eight courses spanning the entire year. For each of the four years classes (or classifications) were offered strictly based on the students' performance in the exams held at the year end, provided the stiudents had satisfactorily completed the practical assignments related to labotrary/field-activity classes. To get a first class the students were expected to maintain an overall average above 75% in the final examination - no grade point average is reported as found in the present education system. For second upper and lower classes the margines were 65% and 55%, respectively. If the a student scored above 45% he/she passed the academic year without a class, or else had to take the 'repeat-exam' held about three months later or the next year-end examination. However, students were allowed to continue to the next year without retaking classes. Final year examination determined the class (or classification) associated with the degree offered, best being first class. Stundents who elected to take two optional courses during the final year received honours degree - e.g. B.Sc.Eng second class (Hons). The examinations were considered difficult to pass as students were supplied with minimum course related material during the exam contrary to the mdodern examination system, where students are not expected to memorize all the formulae and complete derivations. Students were either allowed to select predefined number of questions to answer by ignoring additional questions provided or expected to answer all the questions. All the questions were written type and no multiple choice quesitons(MCQ) were produced. Usually students were expected to derive an equation or a formula from first principle in the first part of the question and then use that in the following parts. Usually the final part of the question was related to applcaitons of the theory that was under consideration.</p>
<p>Since year 2001 course unit system has been adopted in Peradeniya engineering faculty. This allows students to elect courses of their choice and courses are not expected to be taken in the pre-defined secquence unless a course has pre-requisites. Students have to undergo assessments throughout the year and still each year classes (or classifications) are determined but not based on students' grade point average.</p>
<p>In order to introduce the students to practical engineering problems there are programmes for industrial training during the long vacations. These have been drawn up in colloboration with the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), which finds the places in industry. With changes taking place in both university and industry these programmes require review from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="postgraduate-study">Postgraduate Study</h2>
<p>There are four postgraduate courses offered by the university. The degree of <a href="Master_of_Science_in_Engineering" title="wikilink">Master of the Science of Engineering</a> (MSc.Eng.) is awarded after one year of full-time graduate study.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Postgraduate Courses in special subjects are conducted from time to time and these lead to a Diploma in Engineering. The higher degrees of <a href="Master_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Master of Philosophy</a> (M.Phil.) and <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (PhD) are awarded on the basis of dissertations.The programs are sufficiently flexible in structure to accommodate students with diverse professional backgrounds and varying degrees of financial and time constraints.</p>
