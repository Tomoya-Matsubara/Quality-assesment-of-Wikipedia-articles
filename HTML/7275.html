<h3 id="possible-questions-of-biles-appointment-to-the-supreme-court">Possible Questions of Biles Appointment to the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>The appointment of Daniel Biles has been met with a firestorm of criticism from many judicial conservatives over his lack of judicial experience and also from also many ethics watchdog groups over his campaign contributions to Governor <a href="Kathleen_Sebelius" title="wikilink">Kathleen Sebelius</a> and the Kansas Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Transparency records from KanView show that during the 2008 Fiscal year that Biles was the recipient of over $360,000 of contacts for legal representation for the Kansas Department of Education, Kansas State Lottery, and the Kansas Department of Transportation<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

What was noted that Biles during the 2002 Governor's Campaign gave over $1,000 to Sebelius and his wife gave over $1200 from 2002 to 2006 raising the question if patronage in financial terms to Governor Sebelius played a role in his appointment over sound judicial experience<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
