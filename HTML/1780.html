<p><strong>Zon</strong> was a <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> band from <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> formed in the mid-70's</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Formed in Toronto in 1977 the <a href="Rock_band" title="wikilink">Rock band</a> consisted of <a href="vocalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">vocalist</a> Denton Young, <a href="guitarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitarist</a> Brian Miller, <a href="bassist" class="uri" title="wikilink">bassist</a> Jim Sampson, <a href="drummer" class="uri" title="wikilink">drummer</a> Kim Hunt and <a href="keyboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">keyboard</a> player Howard Helm. They released just 3 albums over 5 years. Don V. Lorusso produced the bands first album called 'Astral Projector', released on blue <a href="vinyl" class="uri" title="wikilink">vinyl</a>. The album became an <a href="FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">FM</a> <a href="radio" class="uri" title="wikilink">radio</a> staple in the late '70's. The album garnered the band a 'Best New Group' <a href="Juno_Award" title="wikilink">Juno Awards</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> nomination. The band would find themselves opening up gigs for the likes of <a href="The_Tubes" title="wikilink">The Tubes</a> at Toronto's <a href="Maple_Leaf_Gardens" title="wikilink">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>, and with <a href="Styx_(band)" title="wikilink">Styx</a> and <a href="Moxy_(band)" title="wikilink">Moxy</a> at <a href="CNE_Stadium" title="wikilink">CNE Stadium</a> getting opening slot encores on both occasions!</p>
<p>1979's 'Back Down To Earth' was produced by Don V. Lorusso and the late <a href="Vancouver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a> keyboard whiz <a href="Dale_Jacobs" title="wikilink">Dale Jacobs</a>. The band played <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> as headliners where a hometown crowd swelled to 17,800 people. A reporter for the <a href="Globe_&amp;_Mail" title="wikilink">Globe &amp; Mail</a>, who had only stayed to see the opening act, wrote a scathing review thinking he had seen Zon. The negative review was the headline of the entertainment page, nationally in Canada. <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> demanded compensation for the impact on Zon's popularity but neither the band, nor the label, ever recovered.</p>
<p>Zon was dropped from CBS after a thorough corporate housecleaning of the A &amp; R Department despite Zon already having their contract picked up for a third album.</p>
<p>The ensuing legal battle took much of the heart out of the band, but they did manage one more album for <a href="Falcon_Records" title="wikilink">Falcon Records</a> called 'I'm Worried About The Boys' produced by then former CBS A &amp; R man Bob Gallo. The record featured a cover version of the <a href="Velvet_Underground" title="wikilink">Velvet Underground</a>'s &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;.</p>
<p>As part of the 1980 tour to support the album, Zon did an opening slot for <a href="Alice_Cooper" title="wikilink">Alice Cooper</a> at Toronto's <a href="CNE" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNE</a> <a href="Stadium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stadium</a>. When Cooper failed to appear minutes before showtime, Denton Young was given the onerous task of telling the audience. A riot ensued and police had to be called out. The band broke-up shortly after despite the 1981 single &quot;For You&quot; reaching #2 on CKOC in <a href="Hamilton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamilton</a> (higher than any of the previous singles on CBS Records).</p>
<h2 id="after-zon">After Zon</h2>
<p>Singer Denton Young most recently popped up on Rik Emmett's solo work; Kim Hunt would go on to join <a href="Hanover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanover</a>, <a href="Urgent_(Canadian_band)" title="wikilink">Urgent</a> and is currently in <a href="Moxy_(band)" title="wikilink">Moxy</a>; Jim Samson is now with <a href="Moxy_(band)" title="wikilink">Moxy</a>; Roddi Chappell is in long running AOR band Lightspeed who released two CDs on Pacemaker in the '90s; Brian Miller works at Toronto's famed 12th Fret guitar store; Howard Helm joined Michael Fury which mutated into Refugee. In 1988 Helm was offered a job as touring keyboardist for Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter. He took the job and spent 4 years on the road touring the world. He is currently writing for <a href="TBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">TBS</a> <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> in <a href="Atlanta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a> and <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal Studios</a> in <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando</a>. He continues to play keyboards in-studio for the likes of bands like Seven Mary Three and others.</p>
<p>At the moment Helm and his former Zon bandmates are contemplating a new studio album to coincide with the re-issues of that band's back catalogue on CD?</p>
