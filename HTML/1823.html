<p><strong><em>American Beauty</em></strong> is a 1999 American drama film directed by <a href="Sam_Mendes" title="wikilink">Sam Mendes</a> and written by <a href="Alan_Ball_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">Alan Ball</a>. <a href="Kevin_Spacey" title="wikilink">Kevin Spacey</a> stars as office worker Lester Burnham, who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (<a href="Mena_Suvari" title="wikilink">Mena Suvari</a>). <a href="Annette_Bening" title="wikilink">Annette Bening</a> co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and <a href="Thora_Birch" title="wikilink">Thora Birch</a> plays their insecure daughter, Jane; <a href="Wes_Bentley" title="wikilink">Wes Bentley</a>, <a href="Chris_Cooper_(actor)" title="wikilink">Chris Cooper</a> and <a href="Allison_Janney" title="wikilink">Allison Janney</a> also feature. The film has been described by academics as a satire of <a href="American_middle_class" title="wikilink">American middle class</a> notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, <a href="Marx&#39;s_theory_of_alienation" title="wikilink">alienation</a>, self-liberation and redemption.</p>
<p>Ball began writing <em>American Beauty</em> as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus around the <a href="Amy_Fisher" title="wikilink">Amy Fisher</a> trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry. The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers <a href="Dan_Jinks" title="wikilink">Dan Jinks</a> and <a href="Bruce_Cohen" title="wikilink">Bruce Cohen</a> took <em>American Beauty</em> to <a href="DreamWorks" class="uri" title="wikilink">DreamWorks</a>; the fledgling film studio bought Ball's script for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15 million production and served as the North American distributor. <em>American Beauty</em> marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals <em><a href="Oliver!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oliver!</a></em> and <em><a href="Cabaret_(musical)" title="wikilink">Cabaret</a></em>, Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several &quot;A-list&quot; directors turned down the opportunity.</p>
<p>Spacey was Mendes' first choice for the role of Lester, even though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks' knowledge. <a href="Principal_photography" title="wikilink">Principal photography</a> took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <a href="backlot" class="uri" title="wikilink">backlot</a> in <a href="Burbank,_California" title="wikilink">Burbank</a>, California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer <a href="Conrad_Hall" title="wikilink">Conrad Hall</a> complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone.</p>
<p>Released in North America on September 15, 1999, <em>American Beauty</em> was positively received by critics and audiences alike; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350 million worldwide. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase <em>American Beauty</em>{{'}}s chances of <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> success; at the <a href="72nd_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">72nd Academy Awards</a> the following year, the film won <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="wikilink">Best Picture</a>, <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="wikilink">Best Director</a>, <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="wikilink">Best Actor</a> (for Spacey), <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay" title="wikilink">Best Original Screenplay</a> and <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography" title="wikilink">Best Cinematography</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Lester Burnham (<a href="Kevin_Spacey" title="wikilink">Kevin Spacey</a>) is a middle-aged magazine writer who despises his job. His wife, Carolyn (<a href="Annette_Bening" title="wikilink">Annette Bening</a>), is an ambitious real-estate broker; their sixteen-year-old daughter, Jane (<a href="Thora_Birch" title="wikilink">Thora Birch</a>), abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are retired <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">United States Marine Corps</a> <a href="Colonel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> Frank Fitts (<a href="Chris_Cooper_(actor)" title="wikilink">Chris Cooper</a>) and his introverted wife, Barbara (<a href="Allison_Janney" title="wikilink">Allison Janney</a>); their teenage son, Ricky (<a href="Wes_Bentley" title="wikilink">Wes Bentley</a>), is a secret marijuana smoker and drug dealer whom the colonel subjects to a strict disciplinarian lifestyle. Ricky, who had been forced into a military academy and mental hospital, spends time recording his surroundings with a camcorder; he keeps dozens of taped videos in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Lester becomes infatuated with Jane's cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes (<a href="Mena_Suvari" title="wikilink">Mena Suvari</a>), after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game. He begins to have sexual fantasies about Angela, during which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane (<a href="Peter_Gallagher" title="wikilink">Peter Gallagher</a>). When Lester is about to be laid off his job he blackmails his boss for $60,000 and quits, taking employment serving fast food. He buys his dream car and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he improved his physique. He begins smoking marijuana bought from Ricky and flirts with Angela whenever she visits Jane. Jane becomes involved with Ricky and they bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag dancing in the wind.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Lester discovers Carolyn's infidelity but reacts indifferently. Buddy ends the affair, saying he is facing an expensive divorce. Frank becomes suspicious of Lester and Ricky's friendship, and finds his son's footage of Lester lifting weights while nude, which Ricky captured by chance. Carolyn becomes distraught, loads a gun and drives home. That night, after watching Ricky and Lester through Lester's garage window, Frank mistakenly concludes the pair are sexually involved. He later beats Ricky and accuses him of being gay. Ricky falsely admits the charge and goads his father into kicking him out of their home. Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City, and tells the vain Angela she is ordinary.</p>
<p>Frank confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him; Lester rebuffs the colonel, who leaves. Lester finds a distraught Angela, who begins to seduce him. After learning that Angela is a virgin, Lester stops and comforts her; the pair instead bond over their shared frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen. A gunshot sounds and blood splatters on the wall. Ricky and Jane find Lester's body. Carolyn is seen crying in the bedroom, and Frank returns home, bloodied, a gun missing from his collection. Lester's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life; he says that despite his death he is happy, as there's so much beauty in the world.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="themes-and-analysis">Themes and analysis</h2>
<h3 id="multiple-interpretations">Multiple interpretations</h3>
<p>Academics have offered many possible readings of <em>American Beauty</em>; film critics are similarly divided, not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Described by many as about &quot;the meaning of life&quot; or &quot;gender identification&quot; or &quot;the hollow existence of the American suburbs&quot;,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: &quot;a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories ... it was about imprisonment ... loneliness [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The literary critic and author <a href="Wayne_C._Booth" title="wikilink">Wayne C. Booth</a> concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: &quot;[<em>American Beauty</em>] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds'; but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester's or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live ...&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center&lt;U+2014&gt;a controlling voice who &quot;[unites] all of the choices&quot;.{{#tag:ref|Some postmodernist readings would posit no need for an identified voice; see <a href="Death_of_the_Author" title="wikilink">Death of the Author</a>.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He contends that in <em>American Beauty</em>{{'}}s case it is neither Mendes nor Ball.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was &quot;strongly influential&quot; on set,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> he often had to accept deviations from his vision,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> With &quot;innumerable voices intruding on the original author's,&quot; Booth says, those who interpret <em>American Beauty</em> &quot;have forgotten to probe for the elusive center&quot;. According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy &quot;that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, &quot;reiterating rituals that hardly please him&quot;.

<p>When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> By confronting the issue and Carolyn's &quot;superficial investments in others&quot;, Lester is trying to &quot;regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> His final turning point comes when he and Angela almost have sex;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He holds her close and &quot;wraps her up&quot;. Mendes called it &quot;the most satisfying end to [Lester's] journey there could possibly have been&quot;. With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a &quot;mythical quest&quot;. After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks &quot;to meet his fate&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is &quot;the culmination of the theme&quot; of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Munt</a> argues that <em>American Beauty</em> uses its &quot;art house&quot; trappings to direct its message of non-conformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a &quot;clich&lt;U+00E9&gt; of bourgeois preoccupation ... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film's thematic center is its direction to the audience to &quot;look closer&quot;. The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission that he will soon die, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, &quot;from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? ... if he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? ... There is also the question of how Lester has died&lt;U+2014&gt;or will die.&quot; Anker believes the preceding scene&lt;U+2014&gt;Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father&lt;U+2014&gt;adds further mystery.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside &quot;to view the film and its philosophical issues&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, <em>American Beauty</em> satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a &quot;willing devotee of the popular media's exultation of pubescent male sexuality as a route to personal wholeness&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in &quot;<a href="House_Beautiful" title="wikilink">house beautiful</a>&quot; domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a &quot;fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Burnhams are unaware that they are &quot;materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically&quot; who expect the &quot;rudiments of American beauty&quot; to give them happiness. Anker argues that &quot;they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes ... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The film presents Ricky as its &quot;visionary ... its spiritual and mystical center&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was &quot;an entire life behind things&quot;; he feels that &quot;sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in.&quot; Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the &quot;cultural dross&quot;, has &quot;[grasped] the radiant splendor of the created world&quot; to see God.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so Lester sees himself, Angela and his family &quot;for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are&quot;. He looks at a picture of his family in happier times,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with &quot;wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;he has finally seen the world as it is.<ref name="anker 347<U+2013>348&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>According to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and &quot;[defines] Lester's arc&quot;. First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The <a href="Rosa_&#39;American_Beauty&#39;" title="wikilink">American Beauty rose</a> is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a &quot;fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade for suburban success&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify &quot;a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Carolyn feels that &quot;as long as there can be roses, all is well&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> She cuts the roses and puts them in vases,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> where they adorn her &quot;meretricious vision of what makes for beauty&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and begin to die.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The roses in the vase in the Angela&lt;U+2013&gt;Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses&lt;U+2014&gt;and thus Carolyn&lt;U+2014&gt;out of the shot.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Lester's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed via rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The constant use of red &quot;lulls [the audience] subliminally&quot; into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sexuality-and-repression">Sexuality and repression</h3>
<p>Pennington argues that <em>American Beauty</em> defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from &quot;cold perfectionist&quot; to a more carefree soul who &quot;[sings] happily along with&quot; the music in her car.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Col.

<p><em>American Beauty</em> follows a traditional narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Dr Jacqueline Furby says that the plot &quot;occupies ... no time [or] all time&quot;, citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it &quot;stretches on forever like an ocean of time&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Furby argues that a &quot;rhythm of repetition&quot; forms the core of the film's structure.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> For example, two scenes see the Burnhams' sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other.

<p>According to Drew Miller of <em><a href="Stylus_Magazine" title="wikilink">Stylus</a></em>, the soundtrack &quot;[gives] unconscious voice&quot; to the characters' psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music &quot;accompanies and gives context to&quot; Lester's attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the <a href="counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="wikilink">counterculture of the 1960s</a> combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music.{{#tag:ref|Another example comes with the songs that Carolyn picks to accompany the Burnhams' dinners&lt;U+2014&gt;upbeat &quot;<a href="elevator_music" title="wikilink">elevator music</a>&quot; which is later replaced with more discordant tunes that reflect the &quot;escalating tension&quot; at the table.

The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a &quot;depressed military palette&quot;.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Mendes' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided &quot;a sparse, almost surreal feeling&lt;U+2014&gt;a bright, crisp, hard edged, near <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Magritte" title="wikilink">Magritte</a>-like take on American suburbia&quot;; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes &quot;more fluid and graceful&quot;,<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> and Mendes made minimal use of <a href="steadicam" title="wikilink">steadicams</a>, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table.{{#tag:ref|The shot references a similar one in <em><a href="Ordinary_People" title="wikilink">Ordinary People</a></em> (1980). Mendes included several such homages to other films; family photographs in the characters' homes were inserted to give them a sense of history, but also as a nod to the way <a href="Terrence_Malick" title="wikilink">Terrence Malick</a> used still photographs in <em><a href="Badlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badlands</a></em> (1973).<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> A shot of Lester's jogging was a homage to <em><a href="Marathon_Man_(film)" title="wikilink">Marathon Man</a></em> (1976) and Mendes watched several films to help improve his ability to evoke a &quot;heightened sense of style&quot;: <em><a href="The_King_of_Comedy_(1983_film)" title="wikilink">The King of Comedy</a></em> (1983), <em><a href="All_That_Jazz_(film)" title="wikilink">All That Jazz</a></em> (1979) and <em><a href="Rosemary&#39;s_Baby_(film)" title="wikilink">Rosemary's Baby</a></em> (1968).<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col.

He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> It took Mendes a long time to get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> For the plastic bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air.

He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>Mendes avoided using <a href="close-up" title="wikilink">close-ups</a>, as he believed the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a  screen.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Spielberg&lt;U+2014&gt;who visited the set a few times&lt;U+2014&gt;also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a &quot;great idea&quot; toward the end of a long working day.

<p>Mendes encouraged some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, &quot;I wanted that not just because it was funny ... but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [Spacey] is so in control&lt;U+2014&gt;I wanted him to break through.&quot; Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot ten times.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> The production used small amounts of <a href="computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">computer-generated imagery</a>.

Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Mendes realized during editing that the film was different to the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a &quot;much more whimsical ... kaleidoscopic&quot; film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against <a href="chroma_key" title="wikilink">bluescreen</a>, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;like a <a href="Coen_brothers" title="wikilink">Coen brothers</a> movie&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair were not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening&lt;U+2014&gt;and when the full scene plays out later&lt;U+2014&gt;Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> The subsequent shot&lt;U+2014&gt;an aerial view of the neighborhood&lt;U+2014&gt;was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a></p>
<p>Mendes spent more time re-cutting the first ten minutes than the rest of the film taken together.

Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film &quot;into an episode of <em><a href="NYPD_Blue" title="wikilink">NYPD Blue</a></em>&quot;. Instead, he wanted the ending to be &quot;a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution&quot;.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they &quot;didn't really register&quot;. He and Mendes argued,<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that &quot;for all its darkness had a really romantic heart&quot;.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

Hall and Mendes would first discuss the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by &quot;painting in&quot; the blacks and whites, before adding <a href="fill_light" title="wikilink">fill light</a>, which he reflected from <a href="rigid_panel" title="wikilink">beadboard</a> or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> Hall shot <em>American Beauty</em> in a <a href="Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="wikilink">2.39:1 aspect ratio</a> in the <a href="Super_35" title="wikilink">Super 35</a> format, using <a href="List_of_motion_picture_film_stocks#VISION_color_negative_(ECN-2_process_1996&lt;U+2013&gt;2002)" title="wikilink">Kodak Vision 500T 5279</a> <a href="35_mm_film" title="wikilink">35 mm film stock</a>.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> He shot the whole film at the same <a href="T-stops" title="wikilink">T-stop</a> (T1.9);<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> He used <a href="Panavision_cameras" title="wikilink">Panavision Platinum</a> cameras with the company's Primo series of <a href="prime_lens" title="wikilink">prime</a> and <a href="zoom_lens" title="wikilink">zoom lenses</a>. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and <a href="List_of_motion_picture_film_stocks#EXR_color_negative_(ECN-2_process_1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1996)" title="wikilink">EXR 5248</a> stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8 inch <a href="Tiffen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiffen</a> Black ProMist <a href="Photographic_filter" title="wikilink">filter</a> for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its <a href="anamorphic_format" title="wikilink">anamorphic</a> release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the <a href="Photon_diffusion" title="wikilink">diffusion</a> from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35&lt;U+2013&gt;anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<p>A shot where Lester and Ricky share a <a href="joint_(cannabis)" title="wikilink">cannabis joint</a> behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot &quot;worked perfectly for the tone of the scene&quot;.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

<p>Writing in <em>Variety</em>, Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble &quot;could not be better&quot;; he praised Spacey's &quot;handling of innuendo, subtle sarcasm and blunt talk&quot; and the way he imbued Lester with &quot;genuine feeling&quot;.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> <a href="Janet_Maslin" title="wikilink">Janet Maslin</a> in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> said Spacey was at his &quot;wittiest and most agile&quot; to date,<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> and <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> of the <em><a href="Chicago_Sun-Times" title="wikilink">Chicago Sun-Times</a></em> singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who &quot;does reckless and foolish things [but who] doesn't deceive himself&quot;.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> Kevin Jackson of <em><a href="Sight_&amp;_Sound" title="wikilink">Sight &amp; Sound</a></em> said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of &quot;both sap and hero&quot;.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> Writing in <em><a href="Film_Quarterly" title="wikilink">Film Quarterly</a></em>, Gary Hentzi praised the actors,<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their &quot;fantasy figure&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to &quot;finance [his] own projects&quot;.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her &quot;painfully familiar&quot; attempts to &quot;live up to an unworthy image of herself&quot;.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a> Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> <a href="Kenneth_Turan" title="wikilink">Kenneth Turan</a> of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> said the actors coped &quot;faultlessly&quot; with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance &quot;the energy that drives the film&quot;, saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester's not always being sympathetic. &quot;Against considerable odds, we do like [these characters],&quot; Turan concluded.<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a></p>
<p>Maslin felt that Mendes directed with &quot;terrific visual flair&quot;, saying his minimalist style balanced &quot;the mordant and bright&quot; and that he evoked the &quot;delicate, eroticized power-playing vignettes&quot; of his theater work.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> Jackson said Mendes' theatrical roots rarely showed, and that the &quot;most remarkable&quot; aspect was that Spacey's performance did not overshadow the film. He said that Mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble's strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully.<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> McCarthy believed <em>American Beauty</em> a &quot;stunning card of introduction&quot; for film d&lt;U+00E9&gt;butantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes' &quot;sure hand&quot; was &quot;as precise and controlled&quot; as his theater work. McCarthy cited Hall's involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was &quot;unsurpassed&quot; at conveying the themes of a work.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> Turan agreed that Mendes' choice of collaborators was &quot;shrewd&quot;, naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that <em>American Beauty</em> may have benefited from Mendes' inexperience, as his &quot;anything's possible daring&quot; made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes' accomplishment was to &quot;capture and enhance [the] <a href="dualism" title="wikilink">duality</a>&quot; of Ball's script&lt;U+2014&gt;the simultaneously &quot;caricatured ... and painfully real&quot; characters.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball's choices, admitted the film showed off their &quot;considerable talents&quot;.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a></p>
<p>Turan cited Ball's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> McCarthy said the script was &quot;as fresh and distinctive&quot; as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue &quot;tart&quot; and said the characters&lt;U+2014&gt;Carolyn excepted&lt;U+2014&gt;were &quot;deeply drawn&quot;. One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked &quot;hoary <a href="Sigmund_Freud#Freud&#39;s_ideas" title="wikilink">Freudianism</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> Jackson said the film transcended its clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;d setup to become a &quot;wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy&quot;. He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with &quot;unexpected nuance&quot;.<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating &quot;ironic counterpoint[s]&quot; to the story.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> Hentzi concluded that <em>American Beauty</em> was &quot;vital but uneven&quot;; he felt the film's examination of &quot;the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives&quot; was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside &quot;the most enduring literary treatments&quot; of the theme, such as <em><a href="Lolita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lolita</a></em>. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were &quot;hackneyed&quot;.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a &quot;starting point&quot; from which to tell its &quot;subtle and acutely judged tale&quot;.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> Maslin agreed; she said that while it &quot;takes aim at targets that are none too fresh&quot;, and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own &quot;corrosive novelty&quot;.<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> Ebert awarded <em>American Beauty</em> four stars out of four,<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a> and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex and surprising, concluding it was &quot;a hell of a picture&quot;.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a></p>
<p>A few months after the film's release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press,<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> and the years since have seen its critical regard wane.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a><a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> In 2005, <em><a href="Premiere_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Premiere</a></em> named <em>American Beauty</em> as one of 20 &quot;most overrated movies of all time&quot;;<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a> Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, &quot;I thought some of it was entirely justified&lt;U+2014&gt;it was a little overpraised at the time.&quot;<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a></p>

<p><em>American Beauty</em> was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> The <a href="Chicago_Film_Critics_Association" title="wikilink">Chicago Film Critics Association</a> and the <a href="Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association" title="wikilink">Broadcast Film Critics Association</a> named the film the best of 1999, but although the <a href="New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards" title="wikilink">New York Film Critics Circle</a>, the <a href="National_Society_of_Film_Critics" title="wikilink">National Society of Film Critics</a> and the <a href="Los_Angeles_Film_Critics_Association" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Film Critics Association</a> recognized <em>American Beauty</em>,<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a> they gave their top awards to other films.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested <em>American Beauty</em> was the underdog in the race for Best Picture;<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a> however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, <em>American Beauty</em> won <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Drama" title="wikilink">Best Film</a>, <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Director" title="wikilink">Best Director</a> and <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Screenplay" title="wikilink">Best Screenplay</a>.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a></p>
<p>As the nominations for the <a href="72nd_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">72nd Academy Awards</a> approached, a frontrunner had not emerged.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a> DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for <em>American Beauty</em> five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although <a href="advertising_mail" title="wikilink">direct mail</a> campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in &quot;casual, comfortable settings&quot; in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="wikilink">Best Picture</a> the previous year, <em><a href="Saving_Private_Ryan" title="wikilink">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>, lost to <em><a href="Shakespeare_in_Love" title="wikilink">Shakespeare in Love</a></em>, so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to &quot;think small&quot;. Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of <em>American Beauty</em>, to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the <a href="British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="wikilink">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a>. Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in <a href="Beverly_Hills" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;home to many voters&lt;U+2014&gt;in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen <em>American Beauty</em> to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took Ball to the <a href="Santa_Barbara_International_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Santa Barbara International Film Festival</a>, where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of <a href="Anthony_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Anthony Hopkins</a>, meeting several voters who were in attendance.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a></p>
