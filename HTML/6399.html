<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Mack Ray Edwards was born in <a href="Arkansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a>. He moved to Los Angeles County in 1941. As a heavy equipment operator contracted by <a href="Caltrans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caltrans</a>, he worked on freeways. The body of one of his victims was found underneath the <a href="Santa_Ana_Freeway" title="wikilink">Santa Ana Freeway</a>, and he claimed to have disposed another of his victims under the <a href="Ventura_Freeway" title="wikilink">Ventura Freeway</a>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Edwards killed three children from 1953 to 1956, and three more in 1968 and 1969. In 1970, Edwards and a teenage male accomplice kidnapped three girls from their home in <a href="Sylmar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sylmar</a>. When the girls escaped, Edwards surrendered to police and confessed to <a href="child_molestation" title="wikilink">molesting</a> and murdering six children. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After three bodies were recovered, Edwards pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and was <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">sentenced to death</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="October_30" title="wikilink">October 30</a>, <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a>, following two unsuccessful attempts, Edwards committed <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> by <a href="hanging" title="wikilink">hanging himself</a> with a television cord in his cell in <a href="San_Quentin" title="wikilink">San Quentin</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="victims">Victims</h2>
<h3 id="known-victims">Known Victims</h3>
<p>Edwards was convicted of the murders of three children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stella Darlene Nolan, age 8, of <a href="Compton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Compton</a>, who disappeared <a href="June_20" title="wikilink">June 20</a>, <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>.</li>
<li>Gary Rochet, age 16, of <a href="Granada_Hills" title="wikilink">Granada Hills</a>, who was found after having been shot to death on <a href="November_26" title="wikilink">November 26</a>, <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>.</li>
<li>Donald Allen Todd, age 13, of <a href="Pacoima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pacoima</a>, who disappeared <a href="May_16" title="wikilink">May 16</a>, <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edwards confessed to three additional killings. Because the bodies of the victims were not recovered, he was never officially charged with these murders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don Baker, 13, and Brenda Howell, age 11, of <a href="Azusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azusa</a>, who disappeared <a href="August_6" title="wikilink">August 6</a>, <a href="1956" class="uri" title="wikilink">1956</a>. Howell was Edwards' sister-in-law.</li>
<li>Roger Madison, 16, of Sylmar, disappeared <a href="December_16" title="wikilink">December 16</a>, <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-victims">Possible Victims</h3>
<p>Edwards may have committed other murders, but his own account was inconsistent: while in prison he claimed to have killed 18 children, <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> but in an interview with the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> he said the number was only six.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The 12-year span between Baker's and Howell's disappearances and Rochet's shooting has led investigators to suspect Edwards may have claimed more victims in between. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>As of March 2007, the <a href="Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Police Department</a> is investigating the possibility of Edwards' involvement in the disappearance of Tommy Bowman, 8, of <a href="Redondo_Beach" title="wikilink">Redondo Beach</a>, who disappeared in <a href="Pasadena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pasadena</a> on <a href="March_23" title="wikilink">March 23</a>, <a href="1957" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957</a>. Author Weston DeWalt was researching the Bowman disappearance when he noticed the similarity between a photo of Edwards and a sketch of Bowman's abductor. DeWalt was later shown a letter from Edwards to his wife in which Edwards states that he &quot;left out&quot; Tommy Bowman from his confession to police.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Edwards is also considered a suspect in the disappearances of Bruce Kremen of <a href="Granada_Hills" title="wikilink">Granada Hills</a> and Karen Lynn Tompkins and Dorothy Gale Brown of <a href="Torrance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torrance</a>. Kremen, 6, disappeared from a <a href="YMCA" class="uri" title="wikilink">YMCA</a> camp in <a href="Angeles_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Angeles National Forest</a> on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a>, <a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Tompkins, 11, disappeared on <a href="August_18" title="wikilink">August 18</a>, <a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a>. Brown, also 11, disappeared on <a href="July_3" title="wikilink">July 3</a>, <a href="1962" class="uri" title="wikilink">1962</a>. She had been molested and drowned. Her body was recovered from the ocean off of <a href="Marina_Del_Rey" title="wikilink">Marina Del Rey</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
