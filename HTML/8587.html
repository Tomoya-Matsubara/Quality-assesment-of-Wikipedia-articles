The kingdoms of Uisnech and Mide are not shown; they lie underneath the words &quot;Southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill&quot;." /> <strong>Domnall mac Murchado</strong> (died <a href="20_November" title="wikilink">20 November</a> <a href="763" class="uri" title="wikilink">763</a>), called <strong>Domnall Midi</strong> (Donald of Meath), was <a href="High_King_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">High King of Ireland</a>. He belonged to the <a href="Clann_Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in" title="wikilink">Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in</a> branch of the <a href="U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill" title="wikilink">U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill</a>. Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in's pre-eminence among the southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill, which would last until the rise of <a href="Brian_B&lt;U+00F3&gt;ruma" title="wikilink">Brian B&lt;U+00F3&gt;ruma</a> and the end of the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill dominance in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, dates from his lifetime.</p>
<p>Domnall was chief of Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in for almost fifty years, and High King of Ireland for twenty. In spite of this, and his importance as a dynast, the <a href="Irish_annals" title="wikilink">Irish annals</a> contain relatively few reports of his activities. He was a patron of the <a href="Columba" title="wikilink">Columban</a> churches, particularly <a href="Durrow,_County_Offaly" title="wikilink">Durrow</a>, where he is buried.</p>
<h2 id="origins-and-background">Origins and background</h2>
<p>Domnall was a son of <a href="Murchad_mac_Diarmato" title="wikilink">Murchad mac Diarmato</a>. He had at least one sibling, a brother named Coirpre who died in 749, and it is likely that the Bressal mac Murchado who was killed in 764 was also his brother. Domnall's father ruled as <a href="king_of_Uisnech" title="wikilink">king of Uisnech</a> from the death of his father, <a href="Diarmait_Dian" title="wikilink">Diarmait Dian</a>, in 689 until his own death in 715. He was killed by <a href="Conall_Grant" title="wikilink">Conall Grant</a> of the <a href="S&lt;U+00ED&gt;l_n&lt;U+00C1&gt;edo_Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ine" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00ED&gt;l n&lt;U+00C1&gt;edo Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ine</a> branch of the southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill. A year earlier Murchad had driven out Conall's nephew <a href="Fogartach_mac_N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill" title="wikilink">Fogartach mac N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill</a>, probably the chief king among the southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill, who was exiled to <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Britain</a>. The notice of Murchad's death calls him &quot;king of the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill&quot;, and this is understood as meaning that he was the southern deputy of then-High King <a href="Fergal_mac_M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ele_D&lt;U+00FA&gt;in" title="wikilink">Fergal mac M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ele D&lt;U+00FA&gt;in</a> of the northern <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_nE&lt;U+00F3&gt;gain" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nE&lt;U+00F3&gt;gain</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="king-of-uisnech-king-of-mide">King of Uisnech, King of Mide</h2>
<p>According to later king lists such as those in the <em><a href="Book_of_Leinster" title="wikilink">Book of Leinster</a></em>, Domnall succeeded his father as <a href="king_of_Uisnech" title="wikilink">king of Uisnech</a> on the latter's death. If this is correct, the <a href="Irish_annals" title="wikilink">Irish annals</a> take no notice of him, and it is not until 730 that he is first mentioned.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During this time, the internecine conflict within the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;l n&lt;U+00C1&gt;edo Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ine continued. Fergal mac M&lt;U+00E1&gt;ele D&lt;U+00FA&gt;in had died in battle in <a href="Leinster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leinster</a> in 722. Fogartach mac N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill, who had returned to Ireland in 716 and was once again chief king among the southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill, and latterly Fergal's deputy, succeeded him. Fogartach was killed in battle against his S&lt;U+00ED&gt;l n&lt;U+00C1&gt;edo Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ine kinsman <a href="Cin&lt;U+00E1&gt;ed_mac_&lt;U+00CD&gt;rgalaig" title="wikilink">Cin&lt;U+00E1&gt;ed mac &lt;U+00CD&gt;rgalaig</a> in 724.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Cin&lt;U+00E1&gt;ed was killed in 728 fighting against <a href="Flaithbertach_mac_Loingsig" title="wikilink">Flaithbertach mac Loingsig</a> of the northern <a href="Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l_Conaill" title="wikilink">Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Conaill</a> who became High King after this victory.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 730s war broke out among the northern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill. Flaithbertach was defeated in 732 by Fergal's elder son <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed_All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a> and the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Conaill were again defeated by &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed in 733 when Fergus, son of <a href="Congal_Cendmagair" title="wikilink">Congal Cendmagair</a>, was killed.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Flaithbertach was again defeated by &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed in 734. The <em><a href="Annals_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Annals of Ulster</a></em>, which rarely record the beginnings of the reigns of high kings in this period, record that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed was inaugurated later in 734. Flaithbertach had been deposed, although he survived and entered religion, dying in 765, having outlived two successors.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps taking advantage of this strife, the <a href="King_of_Munster" title="wikilink">King of Munster</a>, <a href="Cathal_mac_Finguine" title="wikilink">Cathal mac Finguine</a>, invaded the midlands in 733. Cathal encamped at <a href="Tailtiu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tailtiu</a>, where the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill high kings traditionally held their main <a href="&lt;U+00F3&gt;enach" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00F3&gt;enach</a>. He was attacked there by Domnall and driven off although he later defeated the minor U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill kindred of <a href="Clann_Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in_Bicc" title="wikilink">Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in Bicc</a> at the <a href="Hill_of_Ward" title="wikilink">Hill of Ward</a>, the site of another major U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill &lt;U+00F3&gt;enach.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's reign was remembered as a time of war.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He began by attacking his traditional enemies, the <a href="Ulaid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulaid</a>, in 735. <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed_R&lt;U+00F3&gt;in" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed R&lt;U+00F3&gt;in</a>, the <a href="King_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">King of Ulster</a>, was killed at a battle near <a href="Faughart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Faughart</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The war among the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;l n&lt;U+00C1&gt;edo Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ine continued in 737 and that same year &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed met with Cathal mac Finguine at <a href="Terryglass" class="uri" title="wikilink">Terryglass</a>. Exactly what was agreed there is unknown, but the annals also state that the law of <a href="Saint_Patrick" title="wikilink">Saint Patrick</a> was in force throughout Ireland.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> It may be that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed and Cathal agreed on an alliance against <a href="Leinster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leinster</a>. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed's father Fergal had been killed campaigning there, and the annals are full of Cathal's generally unsuccessful campaigns against the Leinstermen. In the following &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed and Cathal separately attacked Leinster. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed's invasion led to the battle of &lt;U+00C1&gt;th Senaig, fought on <a href="14_September" title="wikilink">14 September</a> <a href="738" class="uri" title="wikilink">738</a> near <a href="Ballyshannon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballyshannon</a>, <a href="County_Kildare" title="wikilink">County Kildare</a>, also called the battle of the groans. This was a crushing defeat for Leinster. Their king, <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed_mac_Colggen" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed mac Colggen</a>, was killed, as was <a href="Bran_Becc_mac_Murchado" title="wikilink">Bran Becc mac Murchado</a>. The <em>Annals of Ulster</em> say: &quot;so many fell in this great battle that we find no comparable slaughter in a single onslaught and fierce conflict throughout all preceding ages.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Later Cathal campaigned in Leinster and apparently took hostages and tribute from the new king, perhaps <a href="F&lt;U+00E1&gt;el&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_mac_Murchado" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00E1&gt;el&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Murchado</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 739 the <em>Annals of Ulster</em> record that some of Domnall's household were burned to death in a banqueting hall at the unindentified <em>Bodbr&lt;U+00E1&gt;ith</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The enemy are not named.

<h2 id="king-of-tara">King of Tara</h2>
<p>In 743 Domnall defeated and killed &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and a number of kings of the <a href="Airg&lt;U+00ED&gt;alla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Airg&lt;U+00ED&gt;alla</a>, perhaps at <em>Mag Sered</em> near <a href="Kells" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kells</a>, although some annals place the battle in modern <a href="County_Longford" title="wikilink">County Longford</a>, either location suggesting that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed was the aggressor.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The annals offer no explanation as to why the two were at war, but it has been suggested that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed's expansion into the lands of the <a href="Conailli_Muirthemne" title="wikilink">Conailli Muirthemne</a> (in modern <a href="County_Louth" title="wikilink">County Louth</a>) or the killing of <a href="Conaing_mac_Amalgado" title="wikilink">Conaing mac Amalgado</a>, king of Brega, supposedly strangled by &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed in 742, may have been connected to Domnall's return.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Having defeated &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed, the <em>Annals of Ulster</em> state that Domnall again entered the religious life in 744.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> When Flaithbertach's son &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed Muinderg died in 747, the <em>Annals of Ulster</em> call him &quot;king of the North&quot;, suggesting that he was Domnall's deputy among the northern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Domnall seems also to have had a deputy in the south. His distant kinsman Fallomon mac Con Congalt of Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in Bicc may have been <a href="king_of_Mide" title="wikilink">king of Mide</a> in 733, and is definitely styled as such at his death in 766.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Other than this, almost nothing is recorded of Domnall during the twenty years in which he is reckoned to have been High King of Ireland. Unlike &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, he maintained good relations with the <a href="U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_D&lt;U+00FA&gt;nlainge" title="wikilink">U&lt;U+00ED&gt; D&lt;U+00FA&gt;nlainge</a> kings of <a href="Leinster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leinster</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 753 he is said to have imposed the &quot;law of <a href="Columba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Columba</a>&quot; on behalf of <a href="Sl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ib&lt;U+00E9&gt;ne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ib&lt;U+00E9&gt;ne</a>, <a href="Abbot_of_Iona" title="wikilink">Abbot of Iona</a>. Domnall's support for Iona, a policy followed by his descendants, would eventually see the principal Columban church move to Kells during the <a href="Viking_Age" title="wikilink">Viking Age</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>There is only one report of Domnall at war, this in 756. The <em>Annals of Ulster</em> report that Domnall led an army from Leinster into Conailli Muirthemne. This again suggests that he saw the presence of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nE&lt;U+00F3&gt;gain on the eastern coast as a threat to his family's power and also underlines the good relations he enjoyed with the kings of Leinster.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Domnall died in <a href="763_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">763</a> and was buried at the Columban monastery of <a href="Durrow,_County_Offaly" title="wikilink">Durrow</a> in present-day <a href="County_Offaly" title="wikilink">County Offaly</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Although he enjoyed good relations with Iona and was seemingly devout, he was not well-regarded by all Irish churchmen. The <em><a href="F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lire_&lt;U+00D3&gt;engusso" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lire &lt;U+00D3&gt;engusso</a></em>, written at <a href="Tallaght" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tallaght</a> in the borderlands of Leinster, apparently includes him among the oppressive secular rulers whom the authors held in contempt.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="successors-and-descendants">Successors and descendants</h2>
<p>According to the lists of High Kings and the evidence of the annals, Domnall was followed as High King by Niall Frossach, &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed All&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's younger brother.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The succession to the leadership of Clann Cholm&lt;U+00E1&gt;in was disputed.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Domnall had several sons and at least one daughter.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His only recorded wife is Ailb&lt;U+00ED&gt;ne ingen Ailello.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> His son <a href="Donnchad_Midi" title="wikilink">Donnchad Midi</a> is also counted as a High King.
