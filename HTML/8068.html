<p>The church is <a href="cruciform" class="uri" title="wikilink">cruciform</a> in <a href="floor_plan" title="wikilink">plan</a>, and is able to seat 1200. An active place of worship, with hundreds of congregation members and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, it is used for religious services, secular civic ceremonies, concerts and lectures. The choir performs in the abbey and elsewhere. There is a heritage museum in the vaults.</p>
<p>The abbey is a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> particularly noted for its <a href="fan_vaulting" title="wikilink">fan vaulting</a> ceiling. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a>. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders.</p>

<p>Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> following his death in 1087.

With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, it was felt that a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Saint Peter</a> and <a href="Paul_the_Apostle" title="wikilink">Saint Paul</a>, but only the <a href="ambulatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">ambulatory</a> was complete when he died in December 1122.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He was buried in the cathedral.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was <a href="Adelard_of_Bath" title="wikilink">Adelard of Bath</a>; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> but work continued under <a href="Godfrey_of_Bath" title="wikilink">Godfrey</a>, the new bishop, until about 1156; the completed building was approximately  long.

<p>When <a href="Oliver_King" title="wikilink">Oliver King</a>, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495&lt;U+2013&gt;1503, visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He also described lax discipline, idleness and a group of monks &quot;all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He took a year to consider what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Work probably began the following spring. Bishop King planned a smaller church, covering the area of the Norman nave only.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He did not live to see the result, but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the <a href="Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries" title="wikilink">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in 1539.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The new church is not a typical example of the <a href="Perpendicular_(architecture)" title="wikilink">Perpendicular</a> form of <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic architecture</a>; the low aisles and <a href="Arcade_(architecture)" title="wikilink">nave arcades</a> and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was to serve as a monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time.

The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The compasses of the manuals were extended, one and a half octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland; further repairs were effected by <a href="Flight_&amp;_Robson" title="wikilink">Flight &amp; Robson</a> in 1826.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This instrument was removed first to the <a href="Bishop&#39;s_Palace,_Wells" title="wikilink">Bishop's Palace at Wells</a> in 1836,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> then to <a href="Church_of_St_Mary,_Yatton" title="wikilink">St Mary's Church</a>, <a href="Yatton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yatton</a>, where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>The abbey's next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North <a href="Transept" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transept</a> by William Hill &amp; Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> It was mostly removed to the <a href="Church_of_St_Peter_&amp;_St_Paul,_Cromer" title="wikilink">Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul</a>, <a href="Cromer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cromer</a> in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>A new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman &amp; Beard of <a href="Norwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norwich</a>. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South <a href="crossing_(architecture)" title="wikilink">crossing</a> arches, with the <a href="organ_console" title="wikilink">console</a> standing on the floor next to the north-west <a href="pier_(architecture)" title="wikilink">pier</a> of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by <a href="Brian_Oliver_(architect)" title="wikilink">Brian Oliver</a> of Bath, but were never executed.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Norman &amp; Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by <a href="Thomas_Graham_Jackson" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Jackson</a> in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> It was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by <a href="William_Hill_&amp;_Son_and_Norman_and_Beard_Ltd." title="wikilink">Hill, Norman and Beard</a> in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the <a href="organ_console" title="wikilink">console</a>, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence &lt;U+2013&gt; the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972 &lt;U+2013&gt; and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.</p>
<p>The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by <a href="Klais_Orgelbau" title="wikilink">Klais Orgelbau</a> of <a href="Bonn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonn</a>, retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case. New 75 percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in <a href="Saxmundham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saxmundham</a>, <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>, was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has <a href="Tracker_action" title="wikilink">tracker key action</a> on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.</p>
<h4 id="continuo-organ">Continuo organ</h4>
<p>A four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by <a href="Northampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northampton</a>-based <a href="organ_builder" title="wikilink">organ builder</a> <a href="Kenneth_Tickell" title="wikilink">Kenneth Tickell</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three <a href="Pitch_(music)" title="wikilink">pitches</a>: A=440 Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415 Hz and A=486 Hz. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="choir">Choir</h2>
<p>The abbey has sections for boys, girls and men. As well as singing at the abbey, they also tour to cathedrals in the UK and Europe. The choir has broadcast <a href="Evening_Prayer_(Anglican)" title="wikilink">Choral Evensong</a> on <a href="BBC_Radio_3" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 3</a>,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and has made several recordings. It performed at the <a href="The_Three_Tenors" title="wikilink">Three Tenors</a> concert for the opening of the <a href="Thermae_Bath_Spa" title="wikilink">Thermae Bath Spa</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The abbey is also used as a venue for visiting choirs and, from its inception in 1947, the <a href="City_of_Bath_Bach_Choir" title="wikilink">City of Bath Bach Choir</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="heritage-vaults-museum">Heritage Vaults Museum</h2>
<p>The Bath Abbey Heritage Vaults Museum is located in the restored 18th-century cellars, and features artifacts and exhibits about the abbey's history. Displays include the different buildings on the site and their uses, the abbey's impact on the community, the construction, architecture and sculptures of the buildings, artifacts and sculptures, and the role of the abbey in present times.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The museum opened in 1994,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> but is currently closed for redevelopment.</p>
