It demanded the dissolution of the cabinet Mubarak appointed on the 29 January, the suspension of the parliament elected in late 2010 in a poll that was widely suspected of being rigged, the creation of a transitional presidential council made up of four civilians and one member of the military, the formation of a transitional government to prepare for an election to take place within nine months and a body to draft a new democratic constitution, freedom for the media and syndicates and for the formation of political parties, and the scrapping of military and emergency courts.

<p>Military rulers called for an end to the strikes and protests. Thousands of state employees, including police, transit workers, and ambulance drivers, protested for better pay.

<p>On the 18 February, Muslim cleric <a href="Yusuf_al-Qaradawi" title="wikilink">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> arrived in Egypt after his exile in <a href="Qatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qatar</a> and led the &quot;Victory Day&quot; Friday sermon in Tahrir Square, which was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. Men, who appeared to be Qaradawi's guards, barred <a href="Wael_Ghonim" title="wikilink">Wael Ghonim</a> from joining him on stage.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> On that same day, Wael Ghonim wrote the following on his Twitter: &quot;I loved Sheikh Qaradawi Khutbah today.

<p>On the 20 February, the constitutional reform committee stated that its work was almost done,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and also announced that the caretaker government would soon be reshuffled.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> On the 21 February, <a href="David_Cameron" title="wikilink">David Cameron</a>, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, became the first world leader to visit Egypt since Mubarak was ousted as the president. A news blackout was lifted as the prime minister landed in Cairo for a brief five-hour stopover, which had been hastily added to the start of a planned tour of the Middle East.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>A government reshuffle took place on the 22 February, but the defense, interior, foreign, finance, and justice ministries remained unchanged. New ministers included <a href="Yehia_el-Gamal" title="wikilink">Yehia el-Gamal</a> as deputy prime minister, the <a href="New_Wafd_Party" title="wikilink">New Wafd Party</a>'s <a href="Monir_Fakhri_Abdel_Nour" title="wikilink">Monir Fakhri Abdel Nour</a> as tourism minister, the <a href="Tagammu_Party" title="wikilink">Tagammu Party</a>'s <a href="Gowdat_Abdel-Khaleq" title="wikilink">Gowdat Abdel-Khaleq</a> as minister of social solidarity and social justice, and <a href="Ismail_Ibrahim_Fahmy" title="wikilink">Ismail Ibrahim Fahmy</a> as the new labor minister. The changes were not well-received by the public, due to the fact that most of Mubarak's former supporters remained in the cabinet, and there were renewed calls for a demonstration to demand the resignation of the interim government.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Protesters were also set to return to Tahrir Square to keep up the pressure on the interim government.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="march">March</h2>

<p>Before any large protests against him were planned, <a href="Ahmed_Shafik" title="wikilink">Ahmed Shafik</a> stepped down as Prime Minister and was replaced by <a href="Essam_Sharaf" title="wikilink">Essam Sharaf</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Sharaf returned to <a href="Tahrir_Square" title="wikilink">Tahrir Square</a>, which he had also visited during the revolution, to address the Friday mass rally.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The foreign, justice, interior, and oil ministers resigned and three new ministers were named: General and former governor of <a href="Minya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minya</a>, <a href="Mansour_El_Essawi" title="wikilink">Mansour El Essawi</a>, became interior minister; <a href="Mohamed_Abdel_Aziz_Al-Guindy" title="wikilink">Mohamed Abdel Aziz Al-Guindy</a> became justice minister; and former judge <a href="Nabil_Elaraby" title="wikilink">Nabil Elaraby</a> was appointed foreign minister. Secretary General of the <a href="New_Wafd_Party" title="wikilink">New Wafd Party</a>, <a href="Monir_Fakhri_Abdel_Nour" title="wikilink">Monir Fakhri Abdel Nour</a>, remained tourism minister.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> State television aired footage of the ceremony showing the prime minister and his Cabinet taking the oath before Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, who heads the ruling military council.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 5 March, three weeks after Hosni Mubarak was ousted as President, Egyptians turned their anger toward his internal security apparatus by storming the agency's main headquarters and other offices in order to seize documents that would provide evidence of human rights abuses as well as preventing said documents from being destroyed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Following rumors that officials were destroying evidence, 200 protesters stormed the secret police headquarters in Cairo. The closing of the agency has been a key demand of the protesters but one which had not been heeded. Human rights abuses, including torture, were alleged to have been carried out inside it. The protesters stated that they stormed the building to secure evidence as they feared that it might be destroyed.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The SSIS was announced dissolved on 15 March 2011, with a new <a href="National_Security_Force" title="wikilink">National Security Force</a> replacing it.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>A group of youths who participated in the protests announced the formation of the <a href="Party_of_Youths_for_Change" title="wikilink">Party of Youths for Change</a> on the 6 March 2011.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Mohamed_ElBaradei" title="wikilink">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> stated on the 9 March 2011 that he would run in the presidential elections.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 19 March, the <a href="Egyptian_constitutional_referendum,_2011" title="wikilink">constitutional referendum</a> was held, with millions of Egyptians turning up to vote on nine proposed amendments to the constitution.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Eager for their first free vote, Egyptians formed long lines outside polling centers to cast their ballots on constitutional amendments that were sponsored by the ruling military.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In the lead up to the referendum, there was still dispute amongst the political movements and parties in Egypt about whether they should approve or reject the proposed constitutional amendments. 16 of those political parties and movements, including The Alliance of Women's Organizations, announced that they would reject the proposed amendments and call for the creation of a new constitution. The movements also renewed their calls for protests against the amendments to be held. Supporters of the amendments include the <a href="Muslim_Brotherhood" title="wikilink">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, the Wasat Party, and the Labor Party.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The proposed amendments were limited to nine articles, which many deemed to be insufficient as they failed to limit the power of the president, whilst others argued that the amendments were only a temporary measure and as such did not need to include all the changes that were requested, as the Constitution was to be completely redrafted after the parliamentary and presidential elections. This point has proven to be the most contentious with those who oppose the amendments. They claim that a redrafted Constitution will not be representative<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> with the Egyptian presidential candidate <a href="Mohamed_ElBaradei" title="wikilink">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> calling on all Egyptians to reject the proposed constitutional amendments, saying that a &quot;Yes&quot; vote will &quot;provide a parliament not representative of the people, composed mainly of members of the National Democratic Party and benefiting businessmen, the opportunity to uphold a Constitution which is also not representative of the people, and this will take us backwards to a great extent.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> ElBaradei was assaulted when he showed up at a school in Moqattam to vote.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The final results of the referendum were announced the next day: 77.2% of Egyptians voted &quot;YES&quot; to constitutional amendments, while 22.8% voted &quot;NO&quot;. In total, 18,537,954 Egyptians voted out of around 45 million eligible voters, making the turnout 41%.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>On 1 April, protesters called for a &quot;Save the Revolution&quot; day in which thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square after Friday prayers demanded that the ruling military council move faster to dismantle lingering aspects of the old regime; it was the largest protest since Mubarak's resignation.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>On 3 April, the Muslim Brotherhood called on its members to participate in the demonstrations in Tahrir Square on 8 April. Having withheld support for demonstrations held on 1 April because they coincided with <a href="Orphans&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">Orphans' Day</a>, the Brotherhood called for a large turnout to pressure the government to pursue cases against members of the old regime who remained in positions of influence after the revolution. The Brotherhood also suggested the name &quot;Friday of Purging&quot; for the event.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The next day, employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Amonsito Textile Company demonstrated outside cabinet offices.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>On 7 April, the National Association for Change seemed to accept the Brotherhood's proposal, calling for the &quot;Friday of Prosecution and Purging&quot;, a million-man march on Tahrir Square, on 8 April. The NAC also proposed holding a mock &quot;people's trial&quot; of the regime figures for whom they demand the prosecution and/or removal of. While Friday protests in Tahrir Square had been a weekly event, million-man protests had not been seen for some time.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The following day, protesters called for a &quot;Friday of Cleansing&quot; in which hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square again. They criticised the ruling SCAF for not following through on the protesters' previous demands. They called for the resignation of the remaining Mybarak-era figures and the removal of Egypt&lt;U+2019&gt;s public prosecutor due to the slow pace of investigations of corrupt former officials.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>On 9 April, the military used force to break up a camp that protesters had set up in Tahrir Square, as tensions also continued to build between the protesters and the military leadership that were running the country in the interim.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>On 12 April, Hosni Mubarak was questioned in hospital by prosecutors.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The following day the country's Prosecutor General ordered the detention of Mubarak and his two children, <a href="Alaa_Mubarak" title="wikilink">Alaa Mubarak</a> and <a href="Gamal_Mubarak" title="wikilink">Gamal Mubarak</a>, for 15 days. A statement from the Attorney General Egyptian published on its <em>Facebook</em> page said that the arrest warrant was issued after the prosecution presented the charges against them and in accordance with the development of the criminal investigations around the rioting that led to the fall of the regime.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>On the 6 June, crowds of Egyptians dressed in black held demonstrations to honour <a href="Khaled_Said" title="wikilink">Khaled Said</a>, a young man from Alexandria who was beaten to death in 2010 in a savage attack which was blamed on police.

The protesters neither held pictures or banners of Said; they only carried the Egyptian flag. They then marched to Said&lt;U+2019&gt;s family&lt;U+2019&gt;s home in Cleopatra. By the time they arrived there, more people joined, and the number of protesters reached about 1,500.

<p>On the 12 June, an accused Israeli spy, Ilan Grapel, was arrested by Egyptian authorities who said that Grapel was sent to Egypt to build a team that was &lt;U+201C&gt;trying to gather information and data and to monitor the events of the 25 January revolution.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The authorities also said that Grapel tried to incite violence amongst Egyptian protestors, hoping to spark a face-off with the military &lt;U+201C&gt;and spread chaos in the Egyptian public and harm the state's political, economic, and social interests.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Grapel appears to be the same man who told Haaretz that he moved to Israel three years before its 2006 war with Lebanon and ended up enlisting in the Israeli Defense Force. Israel, however, denies the reports, stating that &lt;U+201C&gt;There is no such thing, no Israeli agent has been arrested in Egypt. These reports are false.&lt;U+201D&gt; Friends and relatives of Grapel said that he is a law student in Atlanta with an avid interest in the Middle East, and not a Mossad agent out to sabotage Egypt&lt;U+2019&gt;s revolution, as Egyptian authorities have charged. His mother said he arrived in Cairo in May, countering implications that he was involved in protests as early as February. The arrest of 27-year-old Ilan Grapel has sparked fears in Israel that relations with Egypt will sour now that Hosni Mubarak has been deposed.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 19 June, the military prosecution released the editor-in-chief of <a href="Al-Fagr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Fagr</a>, Adel Hammouda, and journalist Rasha Azab without bail pending further investigation. They were both interrogated on charges of publishing false news that disturbed the peace and negligence in the editorial process. Hammouda was released at around 13 pm, while Azab was released at around 16:30 pm after which she immediately led chants of &lt;U+201C&gt;down with military rule.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Azab had written an article about a meeting between SCAF and prominent members of an advocacy group against military trials for civilians called &lt;U+201C&gt;No to Military Trials&lt;U+201D&gt; in which group members provided SCAF with proof and evidence of military violations against civilians. Azab said that Major General Hassan El-Roweiny was astonished when he saw the pictures and testimonies. She added that El-Roweiny apologized to one of the female witnesses for being violated in military prison, adding that individual actions don&lt;U+2019&gt;t represent the morals or principles of the army.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 20 June, Mubarak's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said that in 2010 the former president underwent &quot;critical surgery&quot; in Heidelberg, Germany to remove his gallbladder and part of his pancreas which were cancerous. el-Deeb told The Associated Press that &quot;there is evidence suggesting that there is a recurrence of cancer and that it has reached the stomach,&quot;. He called Mubarak's condition &quot;horrible&quot; and said the former leader &quot;doesn't eat and he loses consciousness quite often.&quot; Mubarak is hospitalized in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where he has been living since he was removed from power.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 21 June, Egypt's military rulers launched an online poll to test the popularity of potential presidential candidates, a move that could be aimed at judging public opinion for former officials who were trying to run for positions of parliament again. The list includes at least four ex-military officers as well as Islamists, judges, diplomats and others. Most have declared that they will run, including two former officers.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 22 June, Egypt's cabinet approved a budget for the 2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2012 fiscal year, boosting spending in social programs to meet the growing demands from the people after the uprising. The budget totals &lt;U+00A3&gt;490.6 billion ($83 billion), reflecting a spending increase of 14.7% over the current fiscal year, while revenues are forecast at $59 billion.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> On the same day, leaders of the youth wing of the Muslim Brotherhood have split with their elders to form an independent political party. This has deepened the fractures within the group as some of its prominent members have moved towards a more centrist and liberal version of Islamist politics. The new group, the <a href="Egyptian_Current_Party" title="wikilink">Egyptian Current Party</a>, is expected to advocate the separation of religion from politics, the protection of individual freedoms and the embrace of Islamic morals and culture without the enforcement of Islamic religious law. Its founders, including Islam Lotfy, Mohamed el-Kasaas and Mohamed Abbas, were amongst the young leaders of the Egyptian revolution and broke with the Brotherhood to help lead the first day of protests that brought down Hosni Mubarak.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 26 June, <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a> and <a href="John_Kerry" title="wikilink">John Kerry</a> visited Egypt at the head of a U.S. business delegation. Both politicians said that it was in America&lt;U+2019&gt;s national security interests to see that the uprising succeeded. They said that Washington was not interested in dictating policy to Egypt. Instead, the focus was on finding ways to help the Arab world&lt;U+2019&gt;s most populous nation boost its economy and address the needs of its people.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 28 June, Egyptian security forces clashed with around 5,000 protesters in central Cairo. According to witnesses and medical officials, dozens of demonstrators were injured. Clouds of tear gas engulfed Tahrir Square as the security forces battled to regain control of the central plaza from the demonstrators, many of whom had family members who were killed during the revolution. The families were frustrated with what they perceived to be the slow prosecution of security officers who were believed to be responsible for the deaths of some 850 protesters during the 18-day uprising in February. As Tuesday's clashes moved into early Wednesday morning, rocks and shattered glass littered the streets around Tahrir, as protesters chanted &quot;Down with the military junta&quot;. The demonstrators used motorcycles to ferry the injured to safety.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> According to the Health Ministry some 1,036 people were injured, among them at least 40 policemen. Early the next day there were still some demonstrators who were hurling stones at police near the ministry as commuters went to work. <a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>A Facebook page entitled &quot;The Second Egyptian Revolution of Rage&quot; read: &quot;Seeing that the situation, under the leadership of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, is only going from bad to worse, and since the council has proven from day one that public pressure is the most effective policy for achieving the demands of the legitimate revolution, we have decided to take to the streets and squares [once again] and demonstrate throughout Egypt until our demands are met...&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> On the 1 July, tens of thousands of protesters gathered for what they termed the &quot;Friday of Retribution&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> in Suez, Alexandria and Tahrir Square in Cairo to voice frustrations with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for what they perceived to be the slow pace of change five months after Mubarak's ousting.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 4 July, an explosion at the <a href="Arab_Gas_Pipeline" title="wikilink">pipeline</a> near <a href="Nagah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nagah</a> in the <a href="Sinai_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Sinai Peninsula</a> halted natural gas supplies to Israel and Jordan. This was the third attack on Egyptian gas pipelines since Mubarak was removed from power.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> There was also a failed attempt to attack the pipeline in March.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>On the 8 July, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered for what they called the &quot;Friday of Determination&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> or the &quot;March of the Million&quot; in Suez, Alexandria, Cairo and other cities. They demanded immediate reforms and swifter <a href="Trials_and_judicial_hearings_following_the_2011_Egyptian_revolution" title="wikilink">prosecution of former officials</a> from the ousted government. Revolutionaries in Tahrir square also began another sit-in which is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Most of Egypt's political parties and coalitions supported widespread calls for the protest to be staged across Egypt.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The protesters hoped to start a &quot;second revolution&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The main demand of these groups is to combine efforts toward achieving the goals of the revolution, including: <a href="Human_rights_in_Egypt_under_the_Supreme_Council_of_the_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">banning the trial of civilians by military courts</a>; setting a minimum wage; bringing Mubarak, his sons and the senior officials to justice quickly; banning former National Democratic Party (NDP) members from political activity for five years; releasing all political prisoners; purging the police, the legal system, the media, the universities and the banks of members of the former regime; electing new municipal councils; stopping the exportation of natural gas to Israel;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> the arrest and trial of those responsible for killing protesters and restructuring the ministry of interior. An employee of the <a href="Suez_Canal_University" title="wikilink">Suez Canal University</a> said that, in <a href="Ismailiya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ismailiya</a>, there were also protests for higher wages and stable employment contracts.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Protesters also called for the removal of <a href="Mohamed_Hussein_Tantawi" title="wikilink">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> who was said to be emblematic of the old regime.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Several stages have been set up by the <a href="Coalition_of_the_Youth_of_the_Revolution" title="wikilink">Revolution Youth Coalition</a> (a coalition of liberal parties and movements), the Muslim Brotherhood, the Wafd party and leftist parties in order to organise the protests. As the Muslim Brotherhood&lt;U+2019&gt;s stage was the highest and largest, many protesters complained that they were attempting to gain an unfair advantage over the other political parties. These accusations were also compounded by the Muslim Brotherhood's opposition to a sit-in called by other political groups to pressure the Supreme Council of Armed Forces into meeting their demands. Though the Muslim Brotherhood decided to join the protests only two days before the event, it said that it would avoid the sit-in and leave by 17:00. The event was used to rally support for the various groups by organizing their own tents and passing out paraphernalia.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>On 9 July, Minister of Interior <a href="Mansour_Essawy" title="wikilink">Mansour Essawy</a> sacked the head of the Suez Security Police Osama El-Taweel and appointed Adel Abd El-Hamid as his replacement following clashes between families of those killed during the revolution and the Suez police. The clashes, in turn, followed accusations that the head of the Suez police had helped the police officers accused of killing protesters to escape trial after a court ruling released the officers on bail.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Prime Minister Essam Sharaf also responded to the protests, saying that any member of the security forces who was accused of killing protesters would be sacked: &quot;I have issued new instructions as a matter of urgency for the minister of interior to suspend any officers implicated in the killing of protesters. I have also demanded a swift return to the highest levels of security on the streets of Egypt to make them safe again and give our citizens the dignity they deserve.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> On the night of 10 July, gunmen <a href="Arab_Gas_Pipeline" title="wikilink">blew up</a> an Egyptian <a href="natural_gas" title="wikilink">natural gas</a> pipeline to Israel and Jordan in the town of <a href="El-Arish" class="uri" title="wikilink">El-Arish</a> in the <a href="Sinai_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Sinai Peninsula</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> This is the fourth time this has occurred this year and the second time in less than a week</p>
<p>On 11 July, Prime Minister Essam Sharaf made a televised statement reassuring protesters that the government would respond to public demands and also included a timeline in which these demands would be met. The changes included a new cabinet to be formed within one week and a change in provincial governors before the end of the month. The protesters responded with calls for a million-man march the following day and continuation of their sit-in in Tahrir Square. The Muslim Brotherhood responded that they will not participate in the sit-in. The next morning the SCAF issued a statement,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> which was perceived as aggressive.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>On 13 July, state television reported that Egypt's government had met a key demand of protesters by firing nearly 700 top police officers in order to cleanse the discredited and widely unpopular force.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> It was also reported that 37 of the dismissed officers face charges of killing protesters. Among those dismissed were 505 major-generals, including 10 of the interior minister's top assistants, 82 colonels and 82 brigadiers.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>On 14 July, Mubarak told prosecutors that he did not order security forces to open fire on protesters during the initial uprising in February. Transcripts of prosecutors questioning Mubarak were published in two Egyptian newspapers, and judicial officials confirmed the authenticity of the documents.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Mubarak said he issued clear instructions for police not to use force against the protesters. He also denied charges that he ordered or had knowledge of security forces firing on the demonstrators.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>On 16 July, Maj. Gen. Tarek el-Mahdi briefly visited a protest camp in Tahrir Square but left after protesters, some holding shoes in anger, booed him off a stage. He had come to persuade a dozen demonstrators to end a hunger strike which had begun several days ago. El-Mahdi later told state television that he was disappointed that a small crowd of protesters managed to drive him out of the square before he could reach the tent housing the hunger strikers.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Prime Minister Essam Sharaf also accepted the resignation of Foreign Minister Mohammed el-Orabi. He then appointed two new deputies, one of which was prominent economist and former head of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Hazem el-Biblawi.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>On 17 July, Sharaf named 12 new Cabinet members. State television dubbed the new government lineup the &quot;Revolution Cabinet.&quot; Most of the ministers were newcomers as the government sought to placate further criticism by the protesters. Despite the cabinet reshuffle, many of the protesters said that they had no intention of calling off their week-old sit-in.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> One of the prominent members of the &quot;Revolution Cabinet&quot; is the Chief of Antiquities <a href="Zahi_Hawass" title="wikilink">Zahi Hawass</a>. Hawass is a prominant member of Egypts archaeological community, but has been the target of protests himself. These protests were begun by archaeology students who accused him of falsely claiming publicity for himself and corruption. Sharaf also accepted the resignation of Finance Minister Samir Radwan (the reason for his resignation was due to the fact that his new budget was deemed by many protestors to be too conservative in dealing with the poverty which had been one of the main catalysts of the uprising) and the foreign minister, who was replaced by the former ambassador to Saudia Arabia, Mohammed Kamel Omar. Radwan's position was taken by prominent economist Hazem el-Biblawi, who had also been appointed deputy prime minister. There were also changes in the ministries of transport, military production, higher education, communication, agriculture, health, religious endowments, local development, trade and industry and civil aviation, with ministers being replaced.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>On 21 July, the SCAF announced that it would bar foreign monitors in the upcoming <a href="Egyptian_parliamentary_election,_2011" title="wikilink">parliamentary election</a> because of what it claimed was the preservation of Egyptian sovereingty.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

Many in the crowd were thought by protesters to be thugs but some residents of the Abbassiya district were fearful protests in their neighborhood were obstructing business and normalcy. State media said the civilians fighting with the demonstrators were from &quot;people's committees&quot; protecting the neighborhood and the army had maintained all self-restraint, blaming the violence on protesters. Some Abbasiya residents appeared to believe protesters were seeking to create rifts between the army and the people.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Military police, armed with Tasers and batons, fired in the air to stop the demonstrators from approaching the Defense Ministry.
