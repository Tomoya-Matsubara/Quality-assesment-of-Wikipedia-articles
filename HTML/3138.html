<p><strong>Physical therapy</strong> (or <strong>physiotherapy</strong>), often abbreviated <strong>PT</strong>, is a <a href="health_care" title="wikilink">health care</a> profession primarily concerned with the remediation of impairments and disabilities and the promotion of mobility, functional ability, quality of life and movement potential through examination, evaluation, diagnosis and physical intervention carried out by <strong><a href="physical_therapists" title="wikilink">physical therapists</a></strong> (known as <strong><a href="physiotherapists" class="uri" title="wikilink">physiotherapists</a></strong> in most countries) and <strong>physical therapist assistants</strong> (known as <strong>physical rehabilitation therapists</strong> or <strong>physiotherapy assistants</strong> in some countries). In addition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research, education, consultation, and administration. Definitions and licensing requirements in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> vary among jurisdictions, as each state has enacted its own <a href="physical_therapy_practice_act" title="wikilink">physical therapy practice act</a> defining the profession within its jurisdiction, but the <a href="American_Physical_Therapy_Association" title="wikilink">American Physical Therapy Association</a> (APTA) has also drafted a model definition in order to limit this variation, and the APTA is also responsible for accrediting <a href="physical_therapy_education" title="wikilink">physical therapy education</a> curricula throughout the <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">United States of America</a>. In many settings, physical therapy services may be provided alongside, or in conjunction with, other <a href="Medicine" title="wikilink">medical</a> or <a href="Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation" title="wikilink">rehabilitation</a> services.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Physical therapy involves the interaction between therapist, patients or clients, other health care professionals, families, care givers, and communities in a process where movement potential is assessed and diagnosed and goals are agreed upon.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Physical therapy is performed by a therapist and sometimes services are provided by a physical therapist assistant (PTA) acting under their direction. Physical therapists and <a href="occupational_therapists" title="wikilink">occupational therapists</a> often work together in conjunction to provide treatment for patients. In some cases, physical rehabilitation technicians may provide physiotherapy services.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>PTs are healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat individuals of all ages, from newborns to the very oldest, who have medical problems or other health-related conditions, illnesses, or injuries that limit their abilities to move and perform functional activities as well as they would like in their daily lives.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> PTs use an individual's <a href="Medical_history" title="wikilink">history</a> and <a href="physical_examination" title="wikilink">physical examination</a> to arrive at a <a href="medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnosis</a> and establish a management plan and, when necessary, incorporate the results of laboratory and imaging studies. Electrodiagnostic testing (e.g., <a href="electromyograms" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromyograms</a> and nerve conduction velocity testing) may also be of assistance.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> PT management commonly includes prescription of or assistance with specific exercises, manual therapy, education, manipulation and other interventions. In addition, PTs work with individuals to prevent the loss of mobility before it occurs by developing fitness and wellness-oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles, providing services to individuals and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. This includes providing services in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by aging, injury, disease or environmental factors. Functional movement is central to what it means to be <a href="healthy" class="uri" title="wikilink">healthy</a>.</p>
<p>Physical therapy has many specialties including <a href="sports" class="uri" title="wikilink">sports</a>, <a href="wound_care" title="wikilink">wound care</a>, <a href="Electromyography" title="wikilink">EMG</a>, <a href="cardiopulmonary" class="uri" title="wikilink">cardiopulmonary</a>, <a href="geriatrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">geriatrics</a>, <a href="neurologic" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurologic</a>, <a href="orthopaedic" class="uri" title="wikilink">orthopaedic</a> and <a href="pediatrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">pediatrics</a>. PTs practice in many settings, such as <a href="outpatient_clinic" title="wikilink">outpatient clinics</a> or offices, health and wellness clinics, <a href="rehabilitation_hospital" title="wikilink">rehabilitation hospitals</a> facilities, skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities, private homes, education and research centers, <a href="schools" class="uri" title="wikilink">schools</a>, <a href="hospices" class="uri" title="wikilink">hospices</a>, industrial and this workplaces or other occupational environments, <a href="health_club" title="wikilink">fitness centers</a> and <a href="sports_training" title="wikilink">sports training</a> facilities.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Physical therapists also practice in non-patient care roles such as health policy,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> health insurance, health care administration and as health care executives.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Physical therapists are involved in the medical-legal field serving as experts, performing peer review and <a href="independent_medical_examination" title="wikilink">independent medical examinations</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

The Swedish word for physical therapist is <em>sjukgymnast</em> = someone involved in gymnastics for those who are ill. In 1887, PTs were given official registration by Sweden&lt;U+2019&gt;s National Board of Health and Welfare. Other countries soon followed. In 1894 four nurses in Great Britain formed the <a href="Chartered_Society_of_Physiotherapy" title="wikilink">Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The School of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago in New Zealand in 1913,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the United States' 1914 <a href="Reed_College" title="wikilink">Reed College</a> in Portland, Oregon, which graduated &quot;reconstruction aides.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Modern physical therapy was established in Britain towards the end of the 19th century. Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education, massage, and remedial exercise. These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of 1916. During the First World War women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers, and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized. In 1918 the term &quot;Reconstruction Aide&quot; was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy. The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., following the outbreak of World War I.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement. The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March 1921 in &quot;The PT Review.&quot; In the same year, Mary McMillan organized the Physical Therapy Association (now called the <a href="American_Physical_Therapy_Association" title="wikilink">American Physical Therapy Association</a> (APTA). In 1924, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for <a href="polio" class="uri" title="wikilink">polio</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Treatment through the 1940s primarily consisted of <a href="exercise" class="uri" title="wikilink">exercise</a>, massage, and <a href="traction_(orthopedics)" title="wikilink">traction</a>. Manipulative procedures to the spine and extremity joints began to be practiced, especially in the British Commonwealth countries, in the early 1950s.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Later that decade, physical therapists started to move beyond hospital-based practice to outpatient orthopedic clinics, public schools, colleges/universities health-centres, geriatric settings (skilled nursing facilities), rehabilitation centers and medical centers. In 1921 in the United States physical therapists formed the first professional association called the American Women's Physical Therapeutic Association. This gave birth to what is known today as the APTA (American Physical Therapy Association), and currently represents approximately 76,000 members throughout the United States. The APTA defines physical therapy as: &quot;clinical applications in the restoration, maintenance, and promotion of optimal physical function.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Specialization for physical therapy in the U.S. occurred in 1974, with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specializing in orthopaedics. In the same year, the <a href="International_Federation_of_Orthopaedic_Manipulative_Physical_Therapists" title="wikilink">International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists</a> was formed,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> which has ever since played an important role in advancing manual therapy worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>Educational criteria for physical therapy providers vary from state to state and from country to country, and among various levels of professional responsibility. Most <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. states</a> have <a href="physical_therapy_practice_act" title="wikilink">physical therapy practice acts</a> that recognize both physical therapists (PT) and physical therapist assistants (PTA), and some jurisdictions also recognize physical therapy technicians (PT Techs) or aides.</p>
<h3 id="physical-therapists">Physical Therapists</h3>
<p>The primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT), who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairments, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients. Currently, most Physical Therapist education curricula in the United States culminate in a <a href="Doctor_of_Physical_Therapy" title="wikilink">Doctor of Physical Therapy</a> (DPT) degree,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> but many currently practicing PTs hold a <a href="Master_of_Physical_Therapy" title="wikilink">Master of Physical Therapy</a> degree and some hold a <a href="Bachelor&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">Bachelor's degree</a>. The World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) recognizes there is considerable diversity in the social, economic, cultural, and political environments in which physical therapist education is conducted throughout the world. WCPT recommends physical therapist entry-level educational programs be based on university or university-level studies, of a minimum of four years, independently validated and accredited as being at a standard that accords graduates full statutory and professional recognition.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> WCPT acknowledges there is innovation and variation in program delivery and in entry-level qualifications, including first university degrees (Bachelors/Baccalaureate/Licensed or equivalent), Masters and Doctorate entry qualifications. What is expected is that any program should deliver a curriculum that will enable physical therapists to attain the knowledge, skills, and attributes described in these guidelines. Professional education prepares physical therapists to be autonomous practitioners, that may work in collaboration with other members of the health care team. Curricula in the United States are accredited by the <a href="Commission_on_Accreditation_in_Physical_Therapy_Education" title="wikilink">Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education</a> (CAPTE). As of 2011, APTA reports that 222 out of 227 entry-level professional degree programs accredited in the United States are at the doctoral level.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 25,660 students currently enrolled in 210 accredited <a href="List_of_Physical_Therapy_Schools_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">PT programs in the United States</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The physical therapist professional curriculum includes content and learning experiences in the clinical sciences (e.g., content about the cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular systems and the medical and surgical conditions frequently seen by physical therapists).</p>
<p>Curricula for the Physical Therapist professional degree include:</p>

<h4 id="in-canada">In Canada</h4>
<p>In the province of Quebec, prospective physical therapists are required to have completed a <a href="Diploma_of_Collegial_Studies" title="wikilink">college diploma</a> in either health sciences, which lasts on average two years, or physical rehabilitation technology, which lasts at least three years, to apply to a physiotherapy program or <a href="athletic_therapy" title="wikilink">athletic therapy</a> program in university. Following admission, physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation. The B.Sc. usually requires three years to complete. Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master's degree in physical therapy, which normally requires one and a half to two years of study. Graduates who obtain their M.Sc. must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth&lt;U+00E9&gt;rapie du Qu&lt;U+00E9&gt;bec (OPPQ). Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences, sports medicine, kinesiology, and physiology.</p>
<h3 id="physical-therapist-assistants">Physical Therapist Assistants</h3>
<p>Physical therapist assistants may deliver treatments and physical interventions for patients and clients under a care plan established by and under the supervision of a physical therapist. Physical therapist assistants in the United States are currently trained under <a href="associate_degree" title="wikilink">associate of applied sciences</a> curricula specific to the profession, as outlined and accredited by CAPTE. As of August 2011, there were 276 accredited two-year (<a href="Associate_degree" title="wikilink">Associate degree</a>) programs for physical therapist assistants In the United States of America.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 10,598 students currently enrolled in 280 accredited PTA programs in the United States.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
