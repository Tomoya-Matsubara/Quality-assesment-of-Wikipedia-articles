<p>The <strong>Imperial Japanese Navy</strong> (<strong>IJN</strong>) (<a href="Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;jitai" title="wikilink"></a>: &lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+65E5&gt;&lt;U+672C&gt;&lt;U+5E1D&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt; <a href="Shinjitai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shinjitai</a>: &lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+65E5&gt;&lt;U+672C&gt;&lt;U+5E1D&gt;&lt;U+56FD&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt; <em></em> or &lt;U+65E5&gt;&lt;U+672C&gt;&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt; <em>Nippon Kaigun</em>), officially <strong>Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire</strong>, also known as the <strong>Japanese Navy</strong> was the <a href="navy" class="uri" title="wikilink">navy</a> of the <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Empire of Japan</a> from 1869 until 1947, when it was dissolved following Japan's constitutional <a href="Article_9_of_the_Constitution_of_Japan" title="wikilink">renunciation of the use of force</a> as a means of settling international disputes. It was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 behind the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> and <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was supported by the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service</a> for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet. It was a major force in the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific War</a>.</p>
<p>The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy trace back to early interactions with nations on the <a href="Asia" title="wikilink">Asian continent</a>, beginning in the early <a href="history_of_Japan#Feudal_Japan" title="wikilink">medieval period</a> and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of <a href="cultural_diffusion" title="wikilink">cultural exchange</a> with <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> <a href="power_(international)" title="wikilink">powers</a> during the <a href="Age_of_Discovery" title="wikilink">Age of Discovery</a>. After two centuries of stagnation during the country's ensuing <a href="Sakoku" title="wikilink">seclusion policy</a> under the <a href="shogun" title="wikilink">shoguns</a> of the <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Edo period</a>, Japan's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by <a href="Convention_of_Kanagawa" title="wikilink">American intervention</a> in 1854. This eventually led to the <a href="Meiji_Restoration" title="wikilink">Meiji Restoration</a>. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the <a href="Emperor_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Emperor</a> came a period of frantic <a href="modernization" class="uri" title="wikilink">modernization</a> and <a href="industrialization" class="uri" title="wikilink">industrialization</a>. The navy's history of successes, sometimes against much more powerful foes as in the 1895 <a href="First_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Sino-Japanese war</a> and the 1905 <a href="Russo-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Russo-Japanese War</a>, ended in almost complete annihilation during the concluding days of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The IJN was officially dissolved in 1947.</p>

<p><a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the <a href="Sengoku_period" title="wikilink">Warring States period</a>, when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time, Japan may have developed one of the first <a href="Ironclad_warship" title="wikilink">ironclad</a> warships, when <a href="Oda_Nobunaga" title="wikilink">Oda Nobunaga</a>, a <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> <a href="daimyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">daimyo</a>, had six iron-covered <a href="Atakebune" title="wikilink">Oatakebune</a> made in 1576.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1588, <a href="Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="wikilink">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> issued a ban on Wak&lt;U+014D&gt; piracy; the pirates then became vassals of Hideyoshi, and comprised the naval force used in the <a href="Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592-1598)" title="wikilink">Japanese invasion of Korea</a>. It has been stated Admiral Yi built the first combat ironclad seabound, to wreak havoc on the Japanese supply ships during the Imjin Waeran War of 1592&lt;U+2013&gt;97.</p>
<p>Japan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the <a href="Nanban_trade_period" title="wikilink">Nanban trade period</a>. In 1613, the Daimyo of <a href="Sendai,_Miyagi" title="wikilink">Sendai</a>, in agreement with the <a href="Tokugawa_shogunate" title="wikilink">Tokugawa</a> <a href="Shogun" title="wikilink">Bakufu</a>, built <a href="Japanese_warship_San_Juan_Bautista" title="wikilink"><em>Date Maru</em></a>, a 500 ton <a href="galleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">galleon</a>-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of <a href="Hasekura_Tsunenaga" title="wikilink">Hasekura Tsunenaga</a> to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. From 1604, about 350 <a href="Red_seal_ship" title="wikilink">Red seal ships</a>, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, were also commissioned by the Bakufu, mainly for <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asian</a> trade.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1640, for more than 200 years Japan chose &quot;<em><a href="sakoku" class="uri" title="wikilink">sakoku</a></em>&quot; (seclusion), which forbade contacts with the West, eradicated <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death. Contacts were maintained through the Dutch enclave of <a href="Dejima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dejima</a> however, allowing for the transfer of a vast amount of knowledge related to the Western technological and <a href="scientific_revolution" title="wikilink">scientific revolution</a>. This study of Western sciences, called &quot;<em><a href="rangaku" class="uri" title="wikilink">rangaku</a></em>&quot;, also allowed Japan to remain updated in areas relevant to naval sciences, such as <a href="cartography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cartography</a>, <a href="optics" class="uri" title="wikilink">optics</a> or mechanical sciences. The full study of Western <a href="shipbuilding" class="uri" title="wikilink">shipbuilding</a> techniques resumed in the 1840s during the <a href="Late_Tokugawa_shogunate" title="wikilink">Late Tokugawa shogunate</a> (<em>Bakumatsu</em>).</p>

<p>As soon as Japan agreed to open up to foreign influence, the Tokugawa shogun government initiated an active policy of assimilation of Western naval technologies. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the Shogunate acquired its first steam warship, <em>Kank&lt;U+014D&gt; Maru</em>, which was used for training, and established the <a href="Nagasaki_Naval_Training_Center" title="wikilink">Nagasaki Naval Training Center</a>. In 1857, it acquired its first screw-driven steam warship, the <a href="Japanese_warship_Kanrin_Maru" title="wikilink"><em>Kanrin Maru</em></a>. In 1859, the Naval Training Center was transferred to <a href="Tsukiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tsukiji</a> in <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>.

<p>By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Tokugawa navy was already the largest of Eastern Asia, organized around eight Western-style steam warships and the flagship <a href="Japanese_battleship_Kaiy&lt;U+014D&gt;_Maru" title="wikilink"><em>Kaiy&lt;U+014D&gt; Maru</em></a>, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the <a href="Boshin_War" title="wikilink">Boshin War</a>, under the command of Admiral Enomoto.

<p>On <a href="26_March" title="wikilink">26 March</a> <a href="1868" class="uri" title="wikilink">1868</a>, the first Naval Review was held in Japan (in <a href="Osaka_Bay" title="wikilink">Osaka Bay</a>), with 6 ships from the private domainal navies of <a href="Saga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saga</a>, <a href="Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ch&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;</a>, <a href="Satsuma_han" title="wikilink">Satsuma</a>, <a href="Kurume" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kurume</a>, <a href="Kumamoto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kumamoto</a> and <a href="Hiroshima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hiroshima</a> participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2252 tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the Boshin War.</p>
<p>In July 1869, the private domanial navies were abolished, and their 11 ships were added to the 7 surviving vessels of the defunct Tokugawa <em>bakufu</em> navy to form the core of the new Imperial Japanese Navy. In February 1872, the Ministry of Military Affairs was replaced by a separate Army Ministry (&lt;U+9678&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt;&lt;U+7701&gt;) and Navy Ministry (&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt;&lt;U+7701&gt;). In October 1873, <a href="Katsu_Kaishu" title="wikilink">Katsu Kaishu</a> became Navy Minister. The new government drafted an ambitious plan to create a Navy with 200 ships organized into 10 fleets. It was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources.</p>

<p>During the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its &quot;<a href="Jeune_Ecole" title="wikilink">Jeune Ecole</a>&quot; (&quot;young school&quot;) doctrine, favoring small, fast warships, especially <a href="Cruiser_(warship)" title="wikilink">cruisers</a> and <a href="torpedo_boat" title="wikilink">torpedo boats</a>, against bigger units. The choice of France may also have been influenced by the Minister of the Japanese Navy (&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt;&lt;U+537F&gt;), who happened to be <a href="Enomoto_Takeaki" title="wikilink">Enomoto Takeaki</a> at that time (Navy Minister 1880&lt;U+2013&gt;1885), a former ally of the French during the Boshin War.</p>
<p>The <em>Meiji</em> government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats. The naval successes of the <a href="French_Navy" title="wikilink">French Navy</a> against China in the <a href="Sino-French_War" title="wikilink">Sino-French War</a> of 1883&lt;U+2013&gt;85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan. In 1885, the new Navy slogan became <em>Kaikoku Nippon</em> (Jp:&lt;U+6D77&gt;&lt;U+56FD&gt;&lt;U+65E5&gt;&lt;U+672C&gt;, lit. &quot;Maritime Japan&quot;).</p>
<p>In 1885, the leading French Navy engineer <a href="Louis-Emile_Bertin" title="wikilink">Emile Bertin</a> was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of <a href="Kure,_Hiroshima" title="wikilink">Kure</a> and <a href="Sasebo,_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">Sasebo</a>. He developed the <em>Sanseikan</em> class of cruisers; 3 units featuring a single powerful main gun, the 12.6in (320 mm) <a href="Canet_gun" title="wikilink">Canet gun</a>. Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than twenty units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of <a href="Yokosuka,_Kanagawa" title="wikilink">Yokosuka</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>This period also allowed Japan &quot;to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in <a href="torpedo" title="wikilink">torpedoes</a>, torpedo-boats and <a href="Naval_mine" title="wikilink">mines</a>, of which the French at the time were probably the world's best exponents&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a &quot;Torpedo Training Center&quot; at Yokosuka in 1886.</p>
<p>These ships, ordered during the fiscal years 1885 and 1886, were the last major orders placed with France. The unexplained sinking of <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Unebi" title="wikilink"><em>Unebi</em></a> <em>en route</em> from France to Japan in December 1886, created diplomatic frictions and doubts about the French designs.</p>

Following a strategy of &quot;Copy, improve, innovate&quot;,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> foreign ships of various designs were usually analysed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements.

<p>Following a further request to contribute to the conflict, and the advent of <a href="unrestricted_submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> by Germany, the Imperial Navy in March 1917 sent a special force of destroyers to the Mediterranean. This force, consisting of one armoured cruiser, <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Akashi" title="wikilink"><em>Akashi</em></a>, as <a href="flotilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">flotilla</a> leader, and eight of the Navy's newest destroyers (<a href="Japanese_destroyer_Ume" title="wikilink"><em>Ume</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Kusunoki" title="wikilink"><em>Kusunoki</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Kaede" title="wikilink"><em>Kaede</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Katsura" title="wikilink"><em>Katsura</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Kashiwa" title="wikilink"><em>Kashiwa</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Matsu" title="wikilink"><em>Matsu</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Matsu" title="wikilink"><em>Matsu</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Sugi" title="wikilink"><em>Sugi</em></a>, and <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Sakaki" title="wikilink"><em>Sakaki</em></a>), under Admiral Sat&lt;U+014D&gt; K&lt;U+014D&gt;z&lt;U+014D&gt;, was based in <a href="Malta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malta</a> and efficiently protected allied shipping between <a href="Marseille" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marseille</a>, <a href="Taranto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taranto</a>, and ports in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> until the end of the War. In June, <em>Akashi</em> was replaced by <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Izumo" title="wikilink"><em>Izumo</em></a>, and four more destroyers were added (<em>Kashi</em>, <em>Hinoki</em>, <em>Momo</em>, and <em>Yanagi</em>). They were later joined by the cruiser <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Nisshin" title="wikilink"><em>Nisshin</em></a>. By the end of the war, the Japanese had escorted 788 allied transports. One destroyer, <em>Sakaki</em>, was torpedoed by an Austrian submarine with the loss of 59 officers and men.</p>
<p>In 1918, ships such as <a href="Japanese_cruiser_Azuma" title="wikilink"><em>Azuma</em></a> were assigned to <a href="convoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">convoy</a> escort in the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a> between <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a> and the <a href="Suez_Canal" title="wikilink">Suez Canal</a> as part of Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s contribution to the war effort under the <a href="Anglo-Japanese_alliance" title="wikilink">Anglo-Japanese alliance</a>.</p>
<p>After the conflict, the Japanese Navy received seven German submarines as spoils of war, which were brought to Japan and analysed, contributing greatly to the development of the Japanese submarine industry.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="interwar-years">Interwar years</h2>
<p>In the years before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> the IJN began to structure itself specifically to fight the United States. A long stretch of <a href="militarism" title="wikilink">militaristic</a> expansion and the start of the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_war" title="wikilink">Second Sino-Japanese war</a> in 1937 had alienated the United States, which was seen as a rival of Japan.</p>

<p>The Imperial Japanese Navy was faced, before and during World War II, with considerable challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy. To achieve Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s expansionist policies, IJN had to secure and protect distant sources of raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials), controlled by foreign countries (Britain, France, and <a href="Netherlands#Naming_conventions" title="wikilink">the Netherlands</a>). To achieve this goal, she had to build large warships capable of long range.</p>
<p>This was in conflict with Japan's doctrine of &quot;decisive battle&quot; (&lt;U+8266&gt;&lt;U+968A&gt;&lt;U+6C7A&gt;&lt;U+6226&gt;, <em><a href="Kantai_Kessen" title="wikilink">Kantai Kessen</a></em>, which did not require long range),<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> in which IJN would allow the U.S. to sail across the Pacific, using submarines to weaken it, then engage the U.S. Navy in a &quot;decisive battle area&quot;, near Japan, after inflicting such <a href="attrition" class="uri" title="wikilink">attrition</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This is in keeping with the theory of <a href="Alfred_T._Mahan" title="wikilink">Alfred T. Mahan</a>, to which every major navy subscribed before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, in which wars would be decided by engagements between opposing surface fleets<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> (as they had been for over 300 years). It was the basis for Japan's demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the <a href="Washington_Naval_Conference" title="wikilink">Washington Naval Conference</a>, which would give Japan superiority in the &quot;decisive battle area&quot;, and the U.S.'s insistence on a 60% ratio, which meant parity.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Japan, unlike other navies, clung to it even after it had been demonstrated to be obsolete.</p>
<p>It was also in conflict with her past experience. Japan's numerical and industrial inferiority led her to seek technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), qualitative superiority (better training), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in her previous conflicts). She failed to take account of the fact her opponents in the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific War</a> did not face the political and geographical constraints of her previous wars, nor did she allow for losses in ships and crews.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>During the interwar, Japan took the lead in many areas of warship development:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1921 it launched the <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier_H&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink"><em>H&lt;U+014D&gt;sh&lt;U+014D&gt;</em></a>, the first purpose-designed <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">aircraft carrier</a> in the world to be completed,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers second to none.</li>
<li>In keeping with its doctrine, the Imperial Navy was the first navy in the World to mount 14-in (356 mm) guns (in <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Kong&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink">Kong&lt;U+014D&gt;</a></em>), 16-in (406 mm) guns (in <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Nagato" title="wikilink">Nagato</a></em>), and the only Navy ever to mount <a href="18.1&quot;/45" title="wikilink">18.1-in (460 mm) guns</a> (in the <em><a href="Yamato_class_battleship" title="wikilink">Yamato</a>-class ships</em>).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></li>
<li>In 1928, she launched the innovative <em><a href="Fubuki_class_destroyer" title="wikilink">Fubuki</a></em>-class <a href="destroyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">destroyer</a>, introducing enclosed dual 5-inch turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire. The new destroyer design was soon emulated by other navies. The <em>Fubuki</em>s also featured the first <a href="torpedo_tube" title="wikilink">torpedo tubes</a> enclosed in <a href="splinter" title="wikilink">splinterproof</a> <a href="turret" title="wikilink">turrets</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></li>
<li>Japan developed the 24-inch (610 mm) oxygen fuelled <a href="Type_93_torpedo" title="wikilink">Type 93</a> torpedo, generally recognized as the best torpedo in the world, to the end of World War II.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></li>

<p>By 1921, Japan's naval expenditure reached nearly 32% of the national budget. By 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy possessed 10 battleships, 10 aircraft carriers, 38 cruisers (heavy and light), 112 destroyers, 65 submarines, and various auxiliary ships.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Japan at times continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas in which the IJN was inexperienced in, such as naval aviation. In 1918 Japan invited the <a href="French_Military_Mission_to_Japan_(1918-1919)" title="wikilink">French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)</a>, composed of 50 members and equipped with several of the newest types of airplanes to establish the fundamentals of Japanese naval aviation (the planes were several <a href="Salmson_2" title="wikilink">Salmson 2A</a>2, <a href="Nieuport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nieuport</a>, <a href="Spad_XIII" title="wikilink">Spad XIII</a>, two <a href="Breguet_XIV" title="wikilink">Breguet XIV</a>, as well as <a href="Caquot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caquot</a> <a href="dirigible" title="wikilink">dirigibles</a>). In 1921, Japan hosted for a year and a half the <a href="Sempill_Mission" title="wikilink">Sempill Mission</a>, a group of British instructors who were able to train and advise the Imperial Japanese Navy on several new aircraft such as the <a href="Gloster_Aircraft_Company" title="wikilink">Gloster</a> <a href="Gloster_Sparrowhawk" title="wikilink">Sparrowhawk</a>, and on various techniques such as torpedo bombing and flight control.</p>

<p>During the pre-war years, two schools of thought battled over whether the Navy should be organized around powerful battleships, ultimately able to defeat American ones in Japanese waters, or around aircraft carriers. Neither really prevailed, and both lines of ships were developed, with the result neither solution displayed overwhelming strength over the American adversary. A consistent weakness of Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate too much armament, and too much engine power, in comparison to ship size (a side-effect of the Washington Treaty), leading to shortcomings in stability, protection and structural strength.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This was a failing of Japanese naval architects, reflecting her industrial and engineering weakness.</p>
<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>

<p><img src="IJN_Izumo_in_Shanghai.jpg" title="fig:Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser Izumo in Shanghai in 1937." alt="Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser Izumo in Shanghai in 1937." /> The Imperial Japanese Navy of World War II was administered by the <a href="Ministry_of_the_Navy_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Ministry of the Navy of Japan</a> and controlled by the Chief of the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy_General_Staff" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff</a> at <a href="Imperial_General_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Imperial General Headquarters</a>. In order to combat the numerically superior American navy, the IJN devoted large amounts of resources to creating a force superior in quality to any navy at the time. Consequently, at the beginning of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Japan probably had the most sophisticated Navy in the world.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Betting on the speedy success of aggressive tactics (stemming from Mahanian doctrine and the lure of &quot;decisive battle&quot;), Japan did not invest significantly on defensive organization: she needed to protect her long shipping lines against enemy submarines, which she never managed to do, particularly under-investing in the vital role of <a href="antisubmarine_warfare" title="wikilink">antisubmarine warfare</a> (both escort ships and <a href="escort_aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">escort aircraft carriers</a>), and in the specialized training and organization to support it.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>IJN enjoyed spectacular success during the first part of the hostilities, but American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through technological upgrades to its air and naval forces and a vastly stronger industrial output. Japan's reluctance to use their <a href="submarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarine</a> fleet for commerce raiding and failure to secure their communications also hastened her defeat. During the last phase of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including a variety of <a href="Japanese_Special_Attack_Units" title="wikilink">Special Attack Units</a> (popularly called <em><a href="kamikaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">kamikaze</a></em>).</p>
<h3 id="battleships">Battleships</h3>

</figure>
<p>Japan continued to attribute considerable prestige to <a href="battleship" title="wikilink">battleships</a> and endeavoured to build the largest and most powerful ships of the period. <a href="Japanese_battleship_Yamato" title="wikilink"><em>Yamato</em></a>, the largest and most heavily-armed battleship in history, was launched in 1941.</p>
<p>The second half of World War II saw the last battleship duels. In the <a href="Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" title="wikilink">Battle of Guadalcanal</a> on <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a> <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, the United States battleships <a href="USS_South_Dakota_(BB-57)" title="wikilink"><em>South Dakota</em></a> and <a href="USS_Washington_(BB-56)" title="wikilink"><em>Washington</em></a> fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship <a href="Japanese_battleship_Kirishima" title="wikilink"><em>Kirishima</em></a>. In the <a href="Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" title="wikilink">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> on <a href="25_October" title="wikilink">25 October</a> <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a> six battleships, led by Admiral <a href="Jesse_B._Oldendorf" title="wikilink">Jesse Oldendorf</a> of the <a href="U.S._7th_Fleet" title="wikilink">U.S. 7th Fleet</a> fired upon and claimed credit for sinking Admiral <a href="Shoji_Nishimura" title="wikilink">Shoji Nishimura</a>'s battleships <a href="Japanese_battleship_Yamashiro" title="wikilink"><em>Yamashiro</em></a> and <a href="Japanese_battleship_Fus&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink"><em>Fus&lt;U+014D&gt;</em></a> during the <a href="Battle_of_Surigao_Strait" title="wikilink">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>; in fact, both battleships were fatally crippled by destroyer attacks before being brought under fire by Oldendorf's old battleships.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <a href="Battle_off_Samar" title="wikilink">Battle off Samar</a> on <a href="25_October" title="wikilink">25 October</a> <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a> during the <a href="Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" title="wikilink">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> showed battleships could still be useful. Only the indecision of Admiral <a href="Takeo_Kurita" title="wikilink">Takeo Kurita</a> and the fight by American destroyers and <a href="destroyer_escort" title="wikilink">destroyer escorts</a> saved the American aircraft carriers of &quot;<a href="Taffy_3" title="wikilink">Taffy 3</a>&quot; from destruction by the gunfire of <em>Yamato</em>, <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Kong&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink">Kong&lt;U+014D&gt;</a></em>, <em>Haruna</em>, and <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Nagato" title="wikilink">Nagato</a></em> and their cruiser escort. Miraculously for the Americans, only <a href="USS_Gambier_Bay_(CVE-73)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Gambier Bay</em></a>, along with two destroyers and one destroyer escort, were lost in this action.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the maturity of air power spelled doom for the battleship. Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. <em>Yamato</em> and <a href="Japanese_battleship_Musashi" title="wikilink"><em>Musashi</em></a> were sunk by air attacks long before coming in gun range of the American fleet. As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, such as the Japanese <a href="Super_Yamato_class" title="wikilink">Super <em>Yamato</em> class</a>, were cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-carriers">Aircraft carriers</h3>
<p>In the 1920s, the <em>Kaga</em> (originally laid down as a battleship) and a similar ship, the <em>Akagi</em> (originally laid down as a battlecruiser) were converted to aircraft carriers to satisfy the terms of the <a href="Washington_Naval_Treaty" title="wikilink">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>By 1935-1938, senior IJN admirals believed the aircraft carrier to be the equal of the capital ship. <em>Akagi</em> and <em>Kaga</em> received extensive rebuilds to improve aircraft handling capacity. Japan put particular emphasis on <a href="aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a>. The Imperial Japanese Navy started the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific War</a> with 10 aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were seven American aircraft carriers at the beginning of hostilities, only three operating in the Pacific; and eight British aircraft carriers, of which a single one operated in the Indian Ocean. The IJN's two <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;kaku" title="wikilink"><em>Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;kaku</em></a>-class carriers were superior to any carrier in the world, until the wartime appearance of the American <a href="Essex_class_aircraft_carrier" title="wikilink"><em>Essex</em></a>-class.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A large number of these Japanese carriers were of small size, however, in accordance with the limitations placed upon the Navy by the London and Washington Naval Conferences.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="Battle_of_Midway" title="wikilink">Battle of Midway</a>, in which four Japanese fleet carriers were sunk, the Japanese Navy suddenly found itself short of fleet carriers (as well as trained aircrews), resulting in an ambitious set of projects to convert commercial and military vessels into escort carriers, such as the <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiy&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink"><em>Hiy&lt;U+014D&gt;</em></a>. Another conversion project, <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Shinano" title="wikilink"><em>Shinano</em></a>, was based on an incomplete <em>Yamato</em>-class super battleship and became the largest-displacement carrier of World War II. The IJN also attempted to build a number of fleet carriers, though most of these projects were not completed by the end of the war. One exception being the <a href="Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Taih&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink"><em>Taih&lt;U+014D&gt;</em></a>, which was the first and only Japanese carrier with an armored flight deck and first to incorporate a closed hurricane bow.</p>

<p>Japan began the war with a highly competent naval air force designed around some of the best airplanes in the world: the <a href="A6M_Zero" title="wikilink">Zero</a> was considered the best carrier aircraft of the beginning of the war, the <a href="Mitsubishi_G3M" title="wikilink">Mitsubishi G3M</a> bomber was remarkable for its range and speed, and the <a href="Kawanishi_H8K" title="wikilink">Kawanishi H8K</a> was world's best flying boat.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Japanese pilot corps at the beginning of the war were of high caliber as compared to their contemporaries around the world due to intense training and frontline experience in the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Sino-Japanese War</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Navy also had a competent tactical bombing force based around the Mitsubishi G3M and <a href="Mitsubishi_G4M" title="wikilink">G4M</a> bombers, which astonished the world by being the first planes to sink enemy capital ships underway, claiming battleship <a href="Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" title="wikilink"><em>Prince of Wales</em></a> and the battlecruiser <a href="Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" title="wikilink"><em>Repulse</em></a>.</p>
<p>As the war dragged on, the Allies found weaknesses in Japanese Naval Aviation. Though most Japanese aircraft were characterized by great operating ranges, they had very little in the way of defensive armament and armor. As a result, the more numerous, heavily armed and armored American aircraft were able to develop techniques that nullified the advantages of the Japanese aircraft. Although there were delays in engine development, several new competitive designs were developed during the war, but industrial weaknesses, lack of raw materials and disorganization due to Allied bombing raids hampered their mass-production. Furthermore, the IJN didn't have an efficient process for rapid training of aviators, as two years of training were usually considered necessary for a carrier flyer. Therefore, they weren't able to effectively replace seasoned pilots lost through attrition following their initial successes in the Pacific campaign. The IJN pilots' later inexperience was especially evident during the <a href="Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea" title="wikilink">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>, when their aircraft were shot down in droves by the American naval pilots in what the Americans later called the &quot;<a href="Great_Marianas_Turkey_Shoot#Japanese_raids:_The_Great_Marianas_Turkey_Shoot" title="wikilink">Great Marianas Turkey Shoot</a>.&quot; Following the <a href="Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" title="wikilink">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, the Japanese Navy increasingly opted towards deploying aircraft in the <em>kamikaze</em> role.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the conflict, several competitive plane designs were developed, such as the 1943 <a href="Kawanishi_N1K-J" title="wikilink">Shiden</a>, but such planes were produced too late and in insufficient numbers (415 units for the Shiden) to affect the outcome of the war.

These jet designs were partially based on technology received from Nazi Germany, usually in the form of a few drawings only, <em>Kikka</em> being based on the <a href="Messerschmitt_Me_262" title="wikilink">Messerschmitt Me 262</a> and the J8M on the <a href="Messerschmitt_Me_163" title="wikilink">Messerschmitt Me 163</a>), so Japanese manufacturers had to play a key role in the final engineering. These developments also happened too late in the conflict to have any influence on the outcome. The <em>Kikka</em> only flew once before the end of the war.<br />

<p>Japan had by far the most varied fleet of <a href="submarines" class="uri" title="wikilink">submarines</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, including manned torpedoes (<em><a href="Kaiten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiten</a></em>), midget submarines (<a href="Ko-hyoteki_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Ko-hyoteki</em></a>, <a href="Kairyu_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Kairyu</em></a>), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines (many for use by the Army), long-range fleet submarines (many of which carried an aircraft), submarines with the highest submerged speeds of the conflict (<a href="I-200_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Senkou I-200</em></a>), and submarines that could carry multiple bombers (World War II's largest submarine, the <a href="I-400_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Sentoku I-400</em></a>). These submarines were also equipped with the most advanced torpedo of the conflict, the Type 95 torpedo, a 21&quot; (533 mm) version of the famous 24&quot; (61cm) Type 91.</p>
<p>A plane from one such long-range fleet submarine, <em><a href="I-25_(submarine)" title="wikilink">I-25</a></em>, conducted what is still the only aerial bombing attack on the continental United States when Warrant Flying Officer <a href="Nobuo_Fujita" title="wikilink">Nobuo Fujita</a> attempted to start massive forest fires in the Pacific Northwest outside the town of <a href="Brookings,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Brookings</a>, <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> on September 9th, 1942. Other submarines undertook trans-oceanic missions to German-occupied Europe, such as <a href="Japanese_submarine_I-30" title="wikilink"><em>I-30</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_submarine_I-8" title="wikilink"><em>I-8</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_submarine_I-34" title="wikilink"><em>I-34</em></a>, <a href="Japanese_submarine_I-29" title="wikilink"><em>I-29</em></a> and <em><a href="Japanese_submarine_I-52" title="wikilink">I-52</a></em>, in one case flying a Japanese <a href="seaplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">seaplane</a> over France in a propaganda coup.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In May 1942, <a href="Ko-hyoteki_class_submarine" title="wikilink">Type A</a> midget submarines were used in the <a href="Attack_on_Sydney_Harbour" title="wikilink">Attack on Sydney Harbour</a>, and the <a href="Battle_of_Madagascar" title="wikilink">Battle of Madagascar</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, despite their technical prowesses, Japanese submarines were relatively unsuccessful. They were often used in offensive roles against warships (<em>per</em> Mahanian doctrine), which were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships. In 1942, Japanese submarines managed to sink two fleet carriers, one cruiser, and a few destroyers and other warships, and damage several others. They were not able to sustain these results afterwards, as Allied fleets were reinforced and started using better anti-submarine tactics. By the end of the war, submarines were instead often used to transport supplies to island garrisons. During the war, Japan managed to sink about 1 million tons of merchant shipping (184 ships), compared to 1.5 million tons for Britain (493 ships), 4.65 million tons for the US (1079 ships)<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and 14.3 million tons for Germany (2840 ships).</p>
<p>Early models were not very maneuverable under water, could not dive very deep, and lacked <a href="radar" class="uri" title="wikilink">radar</a>. Later in the war, units fitted with radar were in some instances sunk due to the ability of US radar sets to detect their emissions. For example, <a href="USS_Batfish_(SS-310)" title="wikilink"><em>Batfish</em></a> (SS-310) sank three such in the span of four days. After the end of the conflict, several of Japan's most original submarines were sent to Hawaii for inspection in &quot;Operation Road's End&quot; (<a href="I-400_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>I-400</em></a>, <em>I-401</em>, <a href="I-200_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>I-201</em></a> and <em>I-203</em>) before being scuttled by the U.S. Navy in 1946 when the Soviets demanded access to the submarines as well.</p>

<p><img src="Kamikaze_zero.jpg" title="fig:A kamikaze Mitsubishi Zero, about to hit the USS Missouri." alt="A kamikaze Mitsubishi Zero, about to hit the USS Missouri." />  At the end of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, numerous <a href="Japanese_Special_Attack_Units" title="wikilink">Special Attack Units</a> (Japanese: &lt;U+7279&gt;&lt;U+5225&gt;&lt;U+653B&gt;&lt;U+6483&gt;&lt;U+968A&gt;, <em>tokubetsu k&lt;U+014D&gt;geki tai</em>, also abbreviated to &lt;U+7279&gt;&lt;U+653B&gt;&lt;U+968A&gt;, <em>tokk&lt;U+014D&gt;tai</em>) were developed for suicide missions, in a desperate move to compensate for the annihilation of the main fleet. These units included <em><a href="Kamikaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamikaze</a></em> (&quot;Divine Wind&quot;) bombers, <em><a href="Shinyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shinyo</a></em> (&quot;Sea Quake&quot;) suicide boats, <em><a href="Kairyu_class_submarine" title="wikilink">Kairyu</a></em> (&quot;Sea Dragon&quot;) suicide <a href="midget_submarine" title="wikilink">midget submarines</a>, <em><a href="Kaiten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiten</a></em> (&quot;Turn of Heaven&quot;) suicide <a href="torpedoes" class="uri" title="wikilink">torpedoes</a>, and <em><a href="Fukuryu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fukuryu</a></em> (&quot;Crouching Dragon&quot;) suicide scuba divers who would swim under boats and use explosives mounted on bamboo poles to destroy both the boat and themselves. Kamikaze planes were particularly effective during the defense of <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>, in which 1465 planes were expended to damage around 250 American warships.</p>
<p>A considerable number of Special Attack Units were built and stored in coastal hideouts for the desperate defense of the Home islands, with the potential to destroy or damage thousands of enemy warships.</p>

Also in English: <a href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/mth.html">3</a>: <em>&quot;Iron clad ships, however, were not new to Japan and Hideyoshi; <a href="Oda_Nobunaga" title="wikilink">Oda Nobunaga</a>, in fact, had many iron clad ships in his fleet.&quot;</em> (referring to the anteriority of Japanese ironclads (1578) to the Korean <a href="Turtle_ship" title="wikilink">Turtle ships</a> (1592)). In Western sources, Japanese ironclads are described in CR Boxer &quot;The Christian Century in Japan 1549–1650&quot;, p122, quoting the account of the Italian Jesuit Organtino visiting Japan in 1578. Nobunaga's ironclad fleet is also described in &quot;A History of Japan, 1334–1615&quot;, Georges Samson, p309 ISBN 0-8047-0525-9. Korea's &quot;ironclad Turtle ships&quot; were invented by Admiral <a href="Yi_Sun-sin" title="wikilink">Yi Sun-sin</a>, and are first documented in 1592. Incidentally, Korea's iron plates only covered the roof (to prevent intrusion), and not the sides of their ships. The first Western ironclads date to 1859 with the French <a href="FS_La_Gloire_(1858-1883)" title="wikilink"><em>Gloire</em></a> (&quot;Steam, Steel and Shellfire&quot;).<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
