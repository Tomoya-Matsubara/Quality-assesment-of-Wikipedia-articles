<p>Cotton production is an important economic factor in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> as the country leads worldwide in <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> exportation. The US is ranked third in production, behind (1) China and (2) India.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Almost all of the cotton fiber growth and production occurs in southern and western states, dominated by <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, and <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>. More than 99 percent of the cotton grown in the US is of the <a href="Gossypium_hirsutum" title="wikilink">Upland</a> variety, with the rest being <a href="Gossypium_barbadense" title="wikilink">American Pima</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cotton production is a $25 billion-per-year industry in the United States, employing over 200,000 people in total,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as against growth of forty billion pounds a year from 77 million acres of land covering more than eighty counties.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The final estimate of cotton production for the year the 2012 in the US is reported at 17.31 million bales, <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> with the corresponding figures for China being 35 million bales and for India, 26.5 million bales.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Cotton farming in the United States is synonymous with the <a href="African-American_history_of_agriculture_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">African-American history</a> in the country. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms, and 2 in 3 black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming. Cotton farming was one of the major areas of racial tension in its history, where many whites expressed concerns about the mass employment of blacks in the industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners. Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the north in particular, and often strikes by black cotton farmers often broke out. Although the industry was badly affected by falling prices and pests in the early 1920s, the main reason is undoubtedly the mechanization of agriculture in explaining why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the &quot;<a href="Second_Great_Migration_(African_American)" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a>&quot; as mechanization of agriculture was introduced, leaving many unemployed.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The <a href="Hopson_Planting_Company" title="wikilink">Hopson Planting Company</a> produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted, harvested and baled by machinery in 1944.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>


<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Imported from Europe, cotton has an ancient history of over 5000 years, and is also traced to <a href="Alexander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexander</a> carrying cotton cloth on his shoulders while returning from India.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> were observed growing cotton by the Coronado expedition in the early 1540s.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This also ushered the slave trade to meet the growing need for labour to grow cotton, a labour intensive crop and a cash crop of immense economic worth. And in the American South an entire civilization was based the &quot;King Cotton&quot;. As the chief crop, the southern part of USA prospered thanks to the slavery centric civilization. Over the centuries cotton became a staple crop in American agriculture. The cotton farming also subsidized in the country by U.S. government, as a trade policy, specifically to the &lt;U+201C&gt;corporate agribusiness&lt;U+201D&gt; almost ruined the economy of people in many under developed countries such as <a href="Mali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mali</a> and many other developing countries (in view of low profits in the light of stiff competition from the US the workers could hardly make both ends meet to survive with cotton sales).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

While it was recorded in Florida in 1556 and in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, it is believed that cotton has been planted and cultured in the US since 1621.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Plantation owners brought mass supplies of labour from Africa and the Caribbean and Mexico to farm the fields during cotton harvests.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Black women and children were also employed in the industry.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Cotton farming became a major area of racial conflict in the history of the United States, particularly during the 19th-century. Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the north, and many white Democrats were concerned about how many of them were being employed in the US cotton industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> They urged white farmers in the south to take control of the industry, which from time to time resulted in strikes by black cotton pickers; for instance blacks led by the <a href="Colored_Farmer&#39;s_Association" title="wikilink">Colored Farmer's Association</a> (CFA) strikers from <a href="Memphis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> organized a strike in <a href="Lee_County,_Arkansas" title="wikilink">Lee County, Arkansas</a> in 1891, which resulted in much violence.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Black cotton farmers were very important to entrepreneurs which emerged during industrialization in the United States, particularly <a href="Henry_Ford" title="wikilink">Henry Ford</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="th-century">20th century</h3>
<p>The conditions for black cotton farmers gradually improved during the 20th century. <a href="Ralph_J._Bunche" title="wikilink">Ralph J. Bunche</a>, an expert in Negro suffrage in the United States, observed in 1940 that &quot;many thousands of black cotton farmers each year now go to the polls, stand in line with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, in order to determine government policy toward cotton production control.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> However, discrimination towards blacks continued as it did in the rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out. On 25 September 1961 Herbert Lee, a black cotton farmer and voter-registration organizer, was shot on the head by a white State legislator in <a href="Liberty,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Liberty, Missouri</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Yet the cotton industry continued to be very important for blacks in the southern United States, much more so than for whites. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> 3 out of every 4 black farm operators earned at least 40% of their income from cotton farming during this period.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Studies conducted during the same period indicated that 2 in 3 black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The introduction of modern textile machinery such as spinning jenny, power loom, and cotton gin brought in more profits, and cotton towns, &lt;U+201C&gt;more benign than the British&lt;U+201D&gt; came to be established in the country. Following the end of slavery in the southern states, and with immigrants taking control of cotton farming, the <a href="boll_weevil" title="wikilink">boll weevil</a>, an imported variety from Mexico, brought in the 1920s, became popular. The fashion cloth of the <a href="Jeans" title="wikilink">blue jeans</a> furthered boom of cotton for 3 decades. Adoption of chemical pesticides to reduce diseases and thus increase yield of the crop further boosted production. Further innovations in the form of <a href="genetic_engineering" title="wikilink">genetic engineering</a> and of <a href="nanotechnology" class="uri" title="wikilink">nanotechnology</a> are an encouraging development for the growth of cotton.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>  The average production of <a href="Gossypium" title="wikilink">lint</a> per acre in 1914 was estimated by the <a href="USDA" title="wikilink">United States Department of Agriculture</a> to be 209 pounds, a nominal change from 1911 when it was 208 pounds. In the early 1910s, the average yield per acre varied between states: North Carolina (290 pounds), Missouri (279 pounds), South Carolina (255 pounds), Georgia (239 pounds); the yield in California (500 pounds) was attributed to growth on irrigated land.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By 1929, the cotton ranches of California were the largest in the US (by acreage, production, and number of employees).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> By the 1950s, the mechanical picker had gained appeal and affordability throughout the US cotton growing area.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The cotton industry in the United States hit a crisis in the early 1920s. Cotton and tobacco prices collapsed in 1920 following overproduction and the boll weevil pest wiped out the sea island cotton crop in 1921. Annual production slumped from 1,365,000 bales in the 1910s to 801,000 in the 1920s.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In South Carolina, <a href="Williamsburg_County" title="wikilink">Williamsburg County</a> production fell from 37,000 bales in 1920 to 2,700 bales in 1922 and one farmer in <a href="McCormick_County" title="wikilink">McCormick County</a> produced 65 bales in 1921 and just 6 in 1922.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> As a result of the devastating harvest of 1922, some 50,000 black cotton workers left South Carolina, and by the 1930s the state population had declined some 15%, largely due to cotton stagnation.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Although the industry was badly affected by falling prices and pests in the early 1920s, the main reason is undoubtedly the mechanization of agriculture in explaining why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the &quot;<a href="Second_Great_Migration" title="wikilink">Great Migration</a>&quot; as mechanization of agriculture was introduced, leaving many unemployed.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The <a href="Hopson_Planting_Company" title="wikilink">Hopson Planting Company</a> produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted, harvested and baled by machinery in 1944.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="recent-period">Recent period</h3>
<p>In 2012, production totaled 17,314,800 bales, with 12,314,400 acres planted. The average price was US$0.71 per pound with a crop value of US$5.97 billion.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A report published in May 2012 by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service ranked the highest cotton producing states as Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, Missouri, Alabama, California, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="exports">Exports</h2>
<p>The United States is the world's top exporter of cotton, shipping some 12 million bales per annum.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Four out of the top five importers of US-produced cotton are in North America; the principal destination is the state of <a href="Honduras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honduras</a>, with about 33% of the total, although this has been in decline slightly over recent years. The next most important importer is <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, with about 18%, a figure which has been broadly stable, and then the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a>, although exports have declined as a proportion of the total in recent years. China imported about 11% of US cotton last year, which was a sharp increase over previous seasons, allowing it to overtake <a href="El_Salvador" title="wikilink">El Salvador</a>, which has consistently imported about 8-9% of the total.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Cotton exports to China grew from a value of $46 million in 2000 to more than $2 billion in 2010.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="texas">Texas</h3>
<p>Texas produces more cotton than any other state in the US. With eight production regions around Texas, it is the state's leading cash crop. Texas produces approximately 25% of the country's cotton crop on more than 6,000,000 acres, the equivalent of over  of cotton fields.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Texas Cotton Producers includes 9 certified cotton grower organizations; it address national and statewide cotton grower issues, such as the national farm bill and environmental legislation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <img src="CottonModuleLoading.JPG" title="fig:Loading cotton module in California (2002)" alt="Loading cotton module in California (2002)" /></p>
<h3 id="california">California</h3>
<p>California&lt;U+2019&gt;s cotton is mostly grown in seven counties within the <a href="San_Joaquin_Valley" title="wikilink">San Joaquin Valley</a>, though <a href="Imperial_Valley" title="wikilink">Imperial Valley</a> and <a href="Palo_Verde_Valley" title="wikilink">Palo Verde Valley</a> also have acres planted. In the 1990s cotton was also planted in the <a href="Sacramento_Valley" title="wikilink">Sacramento Valley</a>. California is the largest producer of Pima cotton in the U.S. The California cotton industry provides more than 20,000 jobs in the state and generates revenues in excess of $3.5 billion annually.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arizona">Arizona</h3>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th century, federal agricultural engineers worked in the <a href="Arizona_Territory" title="wikilink">Arizona Territory</a> on an experimental farm in <a href="Sacaton,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Sacaton</a>. It was here that <a href="Pima_people" title="wikilink">Pima Indians</a> cultivated various cotton hybrids seeking ideal traits. By the early 1900s, the botanist <a href="Thomas_Henry_Kearney" title="wikilink">Thomas Henry Kearney</a> (1874-1956) created a long staple cotton which was named Pima after the Indians who grew it. In 1910, it was released into the marketplace. While in 1987, Arizona was producing 66% of the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pima cotton, it has dropped to only 2% in recent years.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <img src="Case_IH_cotton_harvester,_rear_view.jpg" title="fig:Cotton harvester in Mississippi (2007)" alt="Cotton harvester in Mississippi (2007)" /></p>
