<h3 id="section-4">2006</h3>

Monfils was given a wildcard into the doubles event, but became more interested and inquired about getting a singles wildcard into the main draw. However, he received an entry into the qualifying singles (which he won). Monfils competed in the main draw of this <a href="Paddle_tennis" title="wikilink">Paddle tennis</a> tournament and surprised everyone when he ousted world no. 1 paddle tennis player <a href="Scott_Freedman" title="wikilink">Scott Freedman</a> and eventually went on to win the whole tournament.</p>
<p>Later on in 2006, Monfils reached the semifinals of the Rome <a href="Tennis_Masters_Series" title="wikilink">Tennis Masters Series</a>, before losing to eventual champion <a href="Rafael_Nadal" title="wikilink">Rafael Nadal</a>. En route to the semifinals, Monfils defeated former world no. 1 <a href="Andy_Roddick" title="wikilink">Andy Roddick</a>. He then entered the <a href="2006_Hamburg_Masters" title="wikilink">Hamburg Masters</a> event, where he lost in straight sets to fellow teenager <a href="Andy_Murray" title="wikilink">Andy Murray</a> in the first round. After that, he faced Murray once more, this time in the first round of the French Open. After a gruelling five&lt;U+2013&gt;set battle, Monfils emerged victorious. Monfils then proceeded to play the Belgian <a href="Dick_Norman" title="wikilink">Dick Norman</a> in the second round. Once again, the match went to five sets, and Monfils got the better of his formidable opponent. Monfils then faced his toughest opponent yet, the American <a href="James_Blake" title="wikilink">James Blake</a>. Blake was the favourite for the win, as he was eighth seed, while Monfils was 25th seed. However, Monfils defeated Blake in another five-set match. Monfils described this run as a marathon. Blake said of Monfils that 'he was the fastest man on the tour'. The fourth round was Monfils' last, as he lost to <a href="Novak_Djokovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Novak Djokovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> in straight sets. Monfils said after the match: 'I am disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity, but you can expect me to return next year'. Monfils then left the court to a standing ovation.</p>
<p>As a result of his progress at the French Open, Monfils moved up five positions to reach a career high of no. 23. This also made him the no. 1 player in France, two positions ahead of S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Grosjean.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Monfils then entered the <a href="Stella_Artois_Championships" title="wikilink">Stella Artois Championships</a>, where he won his first-round match against <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen_Melzer" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Melzer</a>.

Though the odds were against his, Monfils triumphed in straight sets, 7&lt;U+2013&gt;6, 7&lt;U+2013&gt;5. His quarterfinal draw was with <a href="James_Blake" title="wikilink">James Blake</a>, whom he had met earlier at the French Open. This time Blake succeeded. After having lost a set, Monfils retired as a result of a back injury. This injury effectively ruled him out of the Nottingham championships the following week.</p>
<p>At the <a href="2006_Wimbledon_Championships" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a>, Monfils suffered a surprising first-round exit when defeated by <a href="Igor_Kunitsyn" title="wikilink">Igor Kunitsyn</a>.
