However, hydroelectric power has a long history in Russia, dating back to the Soviet era. The rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the Soviet Union began in 1930, when the total installed capacity equaled 600,000 kWh.

<p>The construction of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the Russian Federation.
