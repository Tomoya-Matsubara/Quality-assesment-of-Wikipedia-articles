<p>Alitena has been an important Roman Catholic center in northern Ethiopia as early as 1845, when disciples of <a href="Justin_de_Jacobis" title="wikilink">Justin de Jacobis</a> converted some of the local residents from the <a href="Ethiopian_Church" title="wikilink">Ethiopian Church</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At Easter 1847 the Catholic missionaries de Jacobis and <a href="Guglielmo_Massaia" title="wikilink">Guglielmo Massaia</a>, together with four Ethiopian priests recently ordained by them, celebrated mass there in 1847. Although lacking churches, de Jacobis was fond of the people there, and considered Alitena as a possible place of refuge if there should be persecutions against the Catholics. Since 1934 the <a href="Lazarist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lazarist</a> Mission in Tigray had its main center at Alitena.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
