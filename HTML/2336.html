<p>The <strong>East Washington Avenue Bridge</strong> refers to the bridges that have connected East Washington Avenue over the <a href="Pequonnock_River" title="wikilink">Pequonnock River</a> in <a href="Bridgeport,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>. Records state that a bridge was first constructed on the site in 1836, but no description of the bridge has been found. The second bridge was a truss swing design and underwent heavy repair and modernization in 1893. The third design was a movable Strauss underneath-counter weight deck-girder <a href="bascule_bridge" title="wikilink">bascule bridge</a>. The plans were were drafted by James A. McElroy, using <a href="Joseph_B._Strauss" title="wikilink">Joseph B. Strauss</a>'s design in 1916. However, construction was delayed for years because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds. The bridge was completed by Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging when the <a href="State_of_Connecticut" title="wikilink">State of Connecticut</a> appropriated $350,000 to erect the bridge. Completed in 1925, the bridge underwent several modifications throughout its service life. On July 26, 1983, the bridge was closed after it was found to be in danger of collapse. It reopened after repair, but was closed in the 1990s before being replaced with a modern bascule bridge in 1998. In 2010, the report listed the deck and superstructure conditions as &quot;Good&quot; and the substructure condition as &quot;Satisfactory&quot;.</p>

<p>The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an area that was previously known as Pembroke, the name stemming from the 1650s, that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield, which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1821, it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright; with the intention of selling housing lots. The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one quarter of a mile to the south, but it was changed through public opposition, and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The design of the second East Washington Avenue Bridge is unknown, but the survey in 1916 for its replacement documented a cantilever through truss swing that was .<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The bridge was heavily repaired and remodeled in 1893, around this same period a trolley line was added.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Two decades later, the bridge needed to be replaced and restrictions were made to extend the service life of the bridge, with trolleys, then heavy trucks being banned. The bridge's service life ended in 1917 with its closure.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The City of Bridgeport appointed a bridge commission to replace the aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7, 1915.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The commission chose a <a href="Joseph_B._Strauss" title="wikilink">Joseph B.

The completed bridge included an operator's house and a public toilet building.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The bridge, costing over $550,000 in total, was turned over to the city on October 14, 1925.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
