<p><strong>Idi Amin Dada</strong> (c. <a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a>–<a href="16_August" title="wikilink">16 August</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>) was an <a href="commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">army officer</a> and <a href="President_of_Uganda" title="wikilink">President of Uganda</a> (1971&lt;U+2013&gt;1979). His tenure witnessed much <a href="sectarian_violence" title="wikilink">sectarian violence</a>, including the persecution of the <a href="Acholi_people" title="wikilink">Acholi</a>, <a href="Lango" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lango</a>, <a href="India" title="wikilink">Indian</a> and other ethnic groups, as well as <a href="hindu" title="wikilink">Hindus</a> and <a href="christian" title="wikilink">Christians</a> in <a href="Uganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uganda</a>. The death toll during Amin's regime probably will never be accurately known. An estimate from the <a href="International_Commission_of_Jurists" title="wikilink">International Commission of Jurists</a> is that it was not less than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. Another estimate, compiled by exile organizations with the help of <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a>, put the number killed at 500,000.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>He gave himself the title &quot;<a href="Excellency" title="wikilink">His Excellency</a> <a href="President_of_Uganda" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="President_for_Life" title="wikilink">for Life</a>, <a href="Field_Marshal_(Uganda)" title="wikilink">Field Marshal</a> Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC (for &quot;Victorious Cross&quot;), <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">DSO</a>, <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">MC</a>, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and <a href="Conqueror" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conqueror</a> of the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a> in <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> in General and <a href="Uganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uganda</a> in Particular.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Idi Amin never wrote an autobiography nor authorized any official biography to be written. There is some disagreement as to when and where he was born. Biographical sources usually hold that he was born in <a href="Koboko_District" title="wikilink">Koboko</a>, <a href="West_Nile_sub-region" title="wikilink">West Nile Province</a>, in 1924 or 1925.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to the Ugandan researcher Fred Guweddeko of <a href="Makerere_University" title="wikilink">Makerere University</a>, Idi Amin was born <strong>Idi Awo-Ongo Angoo</strong> in <a href="Kampala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kampala</a> on <a href="17_May" title="wikilink">17 May</a> <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>, fathered by Andreas Nyabire (1889&lt;U+2013&gt;1976). Nyabire was an ethnic <a href="Kakwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kakwa</a> and <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> who converted to <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a> in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Other sources say that Dada was not his father's name, but a nickname Amin acquired during his military career.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Abandoned by his father, Idi Amin grew up with his maternal family. His mother, according to Guweddeko, was called Assa Aatte (1904&lt;U+2013&gt;1970), an ethnic <a href="Lugbara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugbara</a> and a traditional herbalist who among others treated members of <a href="Buganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buganda</a> royalty. He joined an Islamic school in <a href="Bombo,_Uganda" title="wikilink">Bombo</a> in 1941, where he excelled in reciting the <a href="Qur&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qur'an</a>. After a few years he left the school, and did odd jobs before being recruited to the army by a British colonial army officer.</p>
<h2 id="military-career">Military career</h2>
<p>Amin joined the <a href="King&#39;s_African_Rifles" title="wikilink">King's African Rifles</a> (KAR) of the British colonial army in <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a> as part of the laundry and kitchen army staff whilst undergoing training. In <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a> as a <a href="Private_(rank)" title="wikilink">private</a> he transferred to Kenya for infantry service. Amin claimed to have served with the KAR regiment in the <a href="Burma_Campaign" title="wikilink">Burma Campaign</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, but this is disputed as records indicate he was first enlisted after the war was concluded.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>He served in the 21st KAR infantry brigade <a href="Gilgil,_Kenya" title="wikilink">Gilgil</a>, <a href="Kenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenya</a>, until <a href="1949" class="uri" title="wikilink">1949</a> when his unit was deployed in <a href="Somalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> to fight the Somali <a href="Shifta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shifta</a> rebels who were raiding cattle.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In <a href="1952" class="uri" title="wikilink">1952</a> his battalion was deployed against the <a href="Mau_Mau" title="wikilink">Mau Mau</a>. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in <a href="1953" class="uri" title="wikilink">1953</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>, Amin was made <em><a href="effendi" class="uri" title="wikilink">effendi</a></em> (warrant officer), the highest rank possible for a <a href="Black_African" title="wikilink">Black African</a> in the colonial British army. Disputably, his nickname &quot;Dada&quot; was acquired while serving in Kenya; every time he was caught with a woman in his tent, he pleaded that she was his &quot;<em>dada</em>&quot; (<a href="Swahili_language" title="wikilink">Swahili</a> for sister), in order to be let off the hook by his commanders.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Amin returned to Uganda in 1954. In <a href="1961" class="uri" title="wikilink">1961</a>, with Ugandan independence two years away, he became one of the first two Ugandans to become commissioned officers with the rank of <a href="Lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lieutenant</a>. He was then assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Karamojong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karamojong</a> and Kenya&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Turkana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkana</a> <a href="nomad" title="wikilink">nomads</a>. It is alleged that in order to disarm the Karamojong and Turkana, Idi Amin's platoon threatened to castrate the nomads unless they revealed where they had hidden their spears.</p>
<p>During his time in the army, Amin exercised his physical strength as a sportsman, and held Uganda's <a href="light_heavyweight" title="wikilink">light heavyweight</a> <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a> championship from <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a> to <a href="1960" class="uri" title="wikilink">1960</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="promotion-in-the-military">Promotion in the military</h2>
<p>After independence in October 1962, <a href="Milton_Obote" title="wikilink">Milton Obote</a>, Uganda's first <a href="prime_minister" title="wikilink">prime minister</a>, rewarded Idi Amin for his loyalty by promoting him to captain in 1963 and deputy commander of the army in 1964.</p>
<p>In <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a>, Obote and Amin were implicated in a deal to smuggle gold, coffee, and ivory out of the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. A parliamentary investigation demanded by President <a href="Mutesa_II_of_Buganda" title="wikilink">Mutesa</a> (also the <em><a href="Kabaka_of_Buganda" title="wikilink">Kabaka</a></em> (King) of <a href="Buganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buganda</a>), put Obote on the defensive.</p>
<p>In <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, Obote promoted Amin to general and commander of the Ugandan army, had five ministers arrested, suspended the 1962 constitution, and declared himself the new president. The same year Mutesa was forced into exile in Britain where he remained until his death in 1969.</p>
<p>Amin began recruiting members of <a href="Kakwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kakwa</a>, <a href="Lugbara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugbara</a> and other ethnic groups from the <a href="West_Nile_sub-region" title="wikilink">West Nile</a> area bordering <a href="Sudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudan</a>. <a href="Nubians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nubians</a> were also recruited into the army. The Nubians in question had been resident in Uganda since the early 20th century, having been brought from Sudan to serve the colonial army. In Uganda, Nubians were commonly perceived as Sudanese foreigners, and erroneously referred to as <a href="Anyanya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anyanya</a> (Anyanya were southern Sudanese rebels of the <a href="First_Sudanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">First Sudanese Civil War</a> and were not involved in Uganda). Allegations still persist that Idi Amin's army consisted substantially of Sudanese soldiers — a misconception resulting from the reality that many ethnic groups in Northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and Sudan.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="seizure-of-power">Seizure of power</h2>
<p>After hearing that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup</a> on <a href="25_January" title="wikilink">25 January</a> <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a>, when Obote was attending a <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> summit meeting in <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>Idi Amin was initially welcomed both within Uganda and by the international community. In an internal memo, the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="Foreign_Office" title="wikilink">Foreign Office</a> described him as &quot;A splendid type and a good <a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a> player&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He gave former king and president Mutesa, who had died in exile, a state burial in April, 1971, freed many political prisoners, and disbanded the secret police, the General Service Unit.</p>
<h2 id="aminu2019s-rule">Amin&lt;U+2019&gt;s rule</h2>


<p>When he gained power, Amin promised to hold elections within months. Shortly after taking power, however, Amin established the so-called &quot;State Research Bureau&quot;, which were actually his own brand of <a href="death_squads" title="wikilink">death squads</a> to hunt down and murder Obote's supporters, as well as much of the <a href="intelligentsia" class="uri" title="wikilink">intelligentsia</a>, whom he distrusted. Military leaders who had not supported the coup were executed, many by <a href="beheading" class="uri" title="wikilink">beheading</a>.</p>
<p>Obote took refuge in <a href="Tanzania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanzania</a>, from where he attempted to regain the country through a military invasion in September 1972, without success. Obote supporters within the Ugandan army, mainly from the <a href="Acholi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Acholi</a> and <a href="Lango" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lango</a> tribes, were also involved in the invasion. Amin retaliated by bombing Tanzanian towns, and purging the army of Acholi and Lango officers. The ethnic violence grew to include the whole of the army, and then Ugandan civilians. As the violence increased, Amin became more and more paranoid, fearing a coup within his own government. The Nile Mansions Hotel in Kampala became infamous as Amin's interrogation and torture centre.</p>
<p>On <a href="4_August" title="wikilink">4 August</a> <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>, Amin gave Uganda's 50,000 Asians (mostly Indians of <a href="Gujarati_people" title="wikilink">Gujarati</a> origin) 90 days to leave the country, following an alleged dream in which, he claimed, God told him to expel them. Their expulsion resulted in a significant decline in Uganda's Hindu and Muslim population.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Many Asians owned big businesses in Uganda and many Indians were born in the country, their ancestors having come from India to Uganda when the country was still a British colony. Those who remained were deported from the cities to the countryside, although most Asians were granted asylum in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ugandan soldiers during this period engaged in theft and violence against the Asians with impunity.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>, Amin severed diplomatic relations with <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, while turning to <a href="Muammar_al-Qaddafi" title="wikilink">Muammar al-Qaddafi</a> of <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a>, as well as the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, for support.</p>
<p>In <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a>, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> closed its embassy in <a href="Kampala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kampala</a> and in 1976 the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> closed its <a href="High_Commissioner" title="wikilink">High Commission</a> in Uganda.</p>
<p>Uganda under Amin had embarked on a large military buildup, which raised concerns in <a href="Nairobi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nairobi</a>. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet</a>-made arms en route to Uganda at the port of <a href="Mombasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mombasa</a>.</p>
<p>The tension reached its climax in February of 1976 when President Amin suddenly announced that he would investigate the possibility that large parts of <a href="southern_Sudan" title="wikilink">southern Sudan</a> and western and central Kenya, up to within 32 km of Nairobi, were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The Kenyan government response came two days later in a stern statement that said Kenya would not part with &quot;a single inch of territory&quot;. Amin finally backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and armored personnel carriers in defensive positions along the Kenya-Uganda border.</p>
<p>Amin also had strong ties to the <a href="Palestine_Liberation_Organisation" title="wikilink">Palestine Liberation Organisation</a> (PLO). The Israeli embassy was offered to them as headquarters; and <a href="Flight_139" title="wikilink">Flight 139</a>, the <a href="Air_France" title="wikilink">Air France</a> <a href="Airbus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Airbus</a> hijacked from <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> on <a href="27_June" title="wikilink">27 June</a> <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>, was invited by Amin to stop at <a href="Entebbe_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Entebbe International Airport</a> in the city of <a href="Entebbe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Entebbe</a>, 32 km from <a href="Kampala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kampala</a>. The hijackers demanded the release of 53 PLO and <a href="Red_Army_Faction" title="wikilink">Red Army Faction</a> prisoners in return for the 256 hostages and were assisted by Amin's troops. Amin visited the hostages more than once. The hijackers agreed to the release of non-Jewish and non-Israeli passengers and a transport plane, arranged by Amin, had taken off and landed in Europe. The Israeli and Jewish hostages stayed behind. Additionally, the Air France crew refused release so long as some of their passengers were still being held. At midnight on <a href="3_July" title="wikilink">3 July</a> <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>, Israeli commandos attacked the airport and freed all but four of the hostages. (One was killed by the Israeli forces, two by Ugandan soldiers, while another, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, who had been taken to a hospital before the rescue, was killed under Amin's direct orders by two army officers after the hostage rescue). One Israeli commando was also killed, <a href="Jonathan_Netanyahu" title="wikilink">Jonathan Netanyahu</a>, the brother of the future Israeli Prime Minister, <a href="Benjamin_Netanyahu" title="wikilink">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. In the operation, Uganda's air force was badly crippled, as its <a href="fighter_jet" title="wikilink">fighter jets</a> were destroyed. </p>
<p>Partly on the basis of his &quot;visions&quot; and erratic behavior, Idi Amin is often alleged to have suffered from <a href="syphilis" title="wikilink">neurosyphilis</a>: Deborah Hayden makes the case for this hypothesis in her <em>Pox: Genius, Madness and the Mysteries of Syphilis.</em> Also promoting this theory is one of Amin's physicians, who claimed he administered treatments for syphilis to Amin.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Conversely, it has been said that his blood was checked repeatedly for signs of syphilis whilst British doctors held significant roles at Mulago Hospital, the teaching hospital of Makerere Medical School and that no positive results were ever obtained. The prevailing wisdom at the time — 1971/1972 — was that this was a myth originating with the Israelis. Medically, if he were suffering from tertiary syphilis, he would have progressed to overt General Paralysis of the Insane long before he disappeared from scrutiny in his Arabian exile. An alternative explanation of his behaviour could be that he was a simple, poorly-educated Kakwa tribesman who got completely out of his depth in handling power. He was certainly beholden to many of his Army officers, for which reason he could not discipline them when they took the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>Among the most prominent people killed by Idi Amin were: <a href="Benedicto_Kiwanuka" title="wikilink">Benedicto Kiwanuka</a>, the former Prime Minister and later Chief Justice; <a href="Janani_Luwum" title="wikilink">Janani Luwum</a>, the <a href="Anglican_Church" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> <a href="Archbishop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Archbishop</a>; <a href="Joseph_Mubiru" title="wikilink">Joseph Mubiru</a>, the former Governor of <a href="Bank_of_Uganda" title="wikilink">the Central Bank</a>; Frank Kalimuzo, the Vice Chancellor of <a href="Makerere_University" title="wikilink">Makerere University</a>; and Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright. Amin also murdered an Irish missionary.</p>
<p>As the years went on, Amin became increasingly erratic and outspoken. For example, he had his tunics specially lengthened so that he could wear many fake and undeserved <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> medals , including the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a> and <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a>, or rather, facsimile of them. He granted himself a number of grandiose titles, including &quot;King of <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>, after Britain broke diplomatic relations with his regime, Amin declared he had beaten the British and conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). Radio Uganda then read out the whole of his new title (&quot;His Excellency Al-Hadji Field Marshal Dr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Life President of the Republic of Uganda&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>). Amin created a series of Ugandan honors in 1972, including the Order of Uganda, two of the original recipients being British doctors, the Professor of Surgery, Sir Ian McAdam, and Consultant Physician, Dr, David Barkham. Both were expelled at the time of the Asian expulsion, allegedly for spreading what Amin termed &quot;political gonorrhoea.&quot; He awarded himself the highest Ugandan military award, the VC, the initials designating the Victorious Cross, a deliberate play on the British <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a>.</p>
<p>Amin was fond of racing cars (of which he owned several), <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a>, and <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disney</a> cartoons. Many foreign journalists considered him a somewhat comical and <a href="eccentricity_(behaviour)" title="wikilink">eccentric</a> figure; he was widely <a href="caricature" title="wikilink">caricatured</a> in <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">the west</a> as a murderous <a href="buffoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">buffoon</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>, however, the first in-depth and from-the-inside expos&lt;U+00E9&gt; of how murderous Amin's rule actually was became known. <a href="Henry_Kyemba" title="wikilink">Henry Kyemba</a>, Amin's Health Minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, had used travel for a <a href="World_Health_Organisation" title="wikilink">World Health Organisation</a> conference as a means of defecting after coming to fear for his own safety in Uganda. Resettled in Britain, Kyemba wrote and published <em>A State of Blood,</em> an account of Amin and his rule that destroyed any lingering comic or eccentric image still harboured about Amin.</p>
<h2 id="deposition-and-exile">Deposition and exile</h2>

<p>In October 1978, Amin ordered the invasion of <a href="Tanzania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanzania</a> while at the same time attempting to cover up an army <a href="mutiny" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutiny</a>. With the help of Libyan troops, Amin tried to annex the northern Tanzanian province of <a href="Kagera_Region" title="wikilink">Kagera</a>. Tanzania, under <a href="President_of_Tanzania" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Julius_Nyerere" title="wikilink">Julius Nyerere</a>, declared war on Uganda, then began a counterattack, enlisting the country's population of Ugandan exiles.</p>
<p>On <a href="11_April" title="wikilink">11 April</a> <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a>, Amin was forced to flee the capital, <a href="Kampala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kampala</a>, when the Tanzanian army, aided by Ugandan exiles who had united as the <a href="Uganda_National_Liberation_Army" title="wikilink">Uganda National Liberation Army</a>, <a href="The_liberation_of_Kampala" title="wikilink">took the city</a>. Amin fled to exile, first to <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a>, departing Uganda in a <a href="Bell_UH-1" title="wikilink">Bell UH-1</a> registered 5X-UWG, where sources are divided on whether he remained until December 1979 or early 1980, before finding final asylum in <a href="Saudi_Arabia" title="wikilink">Saudi Arabia</a>. He opened a bank account in <a href="Jeddah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jeddah</a> and resided there, subsisting on a government stipend. The new Ugandan government chose to keep him exiled, saying that Amin would face war crimes charges if he ever returned. The Saudi motive was to silence him because of the harm they believed he was doing to <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1989, Amin, who had always held that Uganda needed him, and who never expressed remorse for the abuses of his regime,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> attempted to return to Uganda, apparently to lead an armed group organised by Col. <a href="Juma_Oris" title="wikilink">Juma Oris</a>. He went as far as <a href="Kinshasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kinshasa</a>, <a href="Zaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zaire</a> (now the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>), where Zairian President <a href="Mobutu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mobutu</a> forced him to return to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On <a href="20_July" title="wikilink">20 July</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, one of his wives, Madina, reported that he was near death in a coma at the King Faisal specialist hospital in Jeddah. She pleaded with Ugandan president <a href="Yoweri_Museveni" title="wikilink">Yoweri Museveni</a> that he might be allowed to return to die in his native land. The only response she received from Museveni was a message saying that if Amin returned to Uganda, he would have to &quot;answer for his sins.&quot;</p>
<p>Idi Amin died in Saudi Arabia on <a href="16_August" title="wikilink">16 August</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, and was buried in Ruwais cemetery in <a href="Jeddah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jeddah</a>.
