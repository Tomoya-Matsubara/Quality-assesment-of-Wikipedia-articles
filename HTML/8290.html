It is normally divided into three periods: Western Han (202 BCE &lt;U+2013&gt; 9 CE), the <a href="Xin_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Xin Dynasty</a> (9&lt;U+2013&gt;23 CE), and Eastern Han (25&lt;U+2013&gt;220 CE). The Xin Dynasty, established by the former regent <a href="Wang_Mang" title="wikilink">Wang Mang</a>, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from <a href="Chang&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chang'an</a> to <a href="Luoyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a>. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Major features of the Han economy were: significant <a href="population_growth" title="wikilink">population growth</a>, increasing urbanization, unprecedented growth of industry and trade and government experimentation with <a href="nationalization" class="uri" title="wikilink">nationalization</a>. In this era, the levels of minting and circulation of <a href="Ancient_Chinese_coinage" title="wikilink">coin currency</a> grew significantly, forming the foundation of a stable <a href="monetary_system" title="wikilink">monetary system</a>. The <a href="Silk_Road" title="wikilink">Silk Road</a> facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with <a href="Foreign_relations_of_Imperial_China" title="wikilink">foreign countries</a> across <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a>, many of which were previously unknown to the <a href="Chinese_people" title="wikilink">people of ancient China</a>. The imperial capitals of both Western-Han (Chang'an), and of Eastern-Han (Luoyang), were among the largest cities in the world at the time, in both population and area. Here, government workshops manufactured furnishings for the <a href="Chinese_Palaces" title="wikilink">palaces</a> of the <a href="Emperor_of_China" title="wikilink">emperor</a> and produced goods for the common people. The government oversaw the construction of roads and bridges, which facilitated official government business and encouraged commercial growth. Under Han rule, industrialists, wholesalers and merchants&lt;U+2014&gt;from minor shopkeepers to wealthy businessmen&lt;U+2014&gt;could engage in a wide range of enterprises and trade in the domestic, public, and even military spheres.</p>
<p>In the early Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but they began to rely more heavily upon commercial exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying <a href="Tenant_farmer" title="wikilink">tenants</a> of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential <a href="Four_occupations" title="wikilink">nobles, landowners, and merchants</a>. The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. <a href="Emperor_Wu_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Wu's</a> (r. 141&lt;U+2013&gt;87 BCE) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BCE severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The wealthy landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants&lt;U+2014&gt;upon whom the government relied for tax revenues&lt;U+2014&gt;military manpower, and public works labor. By the 180s CE, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.</p>

<p><img src="Nswag,_dinastia_han,_cavallo_e_cavaliere.JPG" title="fig:A Han tomb pottery cavalry figurine" alt="A Han tomb pottery cavalry figurine" /> Two forms of mass <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a> existed during the Han period. These were civilian conscription (<em>gengzu</em> &lt;U+66F4&gt;&lt;U+5352&gt;) and military conscription (<em>zhengzu</em> &lt;U+6B63&gt;&lt;U+5352&gt;). In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes, all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty-six were required to undertake mandatory conscription duties for one month of each year. These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three years male peasants were drafted to serve in the military, where they were assigned to <a href="infantry" class="uri" title="wikilink">infantry</a>, <a href="Horses_in_East_Asian_warfare" title="wikilink">cavalry</a>, or <a href="Naval_history_of_China" title="wikilink">navy</a> service.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local <a href="militia" title="wikilink">militias</a>, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (<em>Nanjun</em> &lt;U+5357&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt;), while the Northern Army (<em>Beijun</em> &lt;U+5317&gt;&lt;U+8ECD&gt;) was a <a href="standing_army" title="wikilink">standing army</a> composed of paid career soldiers.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Eastern Han, peasants could avoid the month of annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in commutation (<em>gengfu</em> &lt;U+66F4&gt;&lt;U+8CE6&gt;). This development went hand-in-hand with the increasing use of hired labor by the government.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>The grain trade was a profitable private enterprise during the early Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the <em>equable marketing system</em> (also known as the <em>ever-normal granary system</em>) in 110 BCE.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The system was designed by civil servant <a href="Sang_Hongyang" title="wikilink">Sang Hongyang</a> (d. 80 BCE)&lt;U+2014&gt;who was previously a merchant.

<p>Ebrey argues that although most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent <a href="laissez-faire" class="uri" title="wikilink">laissez-faire</a> policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The Eastern Han central government lost an important source of revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers.

<p>The establishment of the <a href="Silk_Road" title="wikilink">Silk Road</a> occurred during Wu's reign, owing to the efforts of the diplomat <a href="Zhang_Qian" title="wikilink">Zhang Qian</a>.

<p>Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 A.D. claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
