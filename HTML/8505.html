Its aims are to discourage the use of private vehicles, to reduce congestion, and to raise funds for investment in public transport. The zone came into operation in parts of <a href="Central_London" title="wikilink">Central London</a> on <a href="17_February" title="wikilink">17 February</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> and it was extended into parts of <a href="West_London" title="wikilink">West London</a> on <a href="19_February" title="wikilink">19 February</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>. Although not the first scheme of its kind in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, it was the largest when it was introduced, and it remains one of the largest in the world. Worldwide, several cities have referenced the London scheme when considering their own possible schemes. A payment of <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>8 is required for each day a chargeable vehicle enters or travels within the zone between 7 am and 6 pm; a fine is imposed for non-payment.</p>
<p>The organisation responsible for the charge is <a href="Transport_for_London" title="wikilink">Transport for London</a> (TfL); <a href="Capita_Group" title="wikilink">Capita Group</a> operates the scheme under contract. The system is run on a generally automatic basis using <a href="CCTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">CCTV</a> and <a href="Automatic_Number_Plate_Recognition" title="wikilink">Automatic Number Plate Recognition</a>.</p>
<p>The congestion charge has been controversial, with reported effects not only on traffic levels but on business activity and the local environment. The revenue raised from the charge has not matched the amounts predicted. The subject of political debate, the charge has been an issue during <a href="Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">London mayoral</a> elections.</p>

<p>TfL can and does suspend the congestion charge either in a small local area to cope with incidents and if directed so by a <a href="police_officer" title="wikilink">police officer</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The congestion charge was suspended on <a href="7_July" title="wikilink">7 July</a> and <a href="8_July" title="wikilink">8 July</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, in response to the <a href="7_July_2005_London_bombings" title="wikilink">terrorist attacks on London Transport</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>While private drivers are obliged to pay the charge either the day before, on the day or on the following day, whether they are seen to enter the zone or not, the same does not apply to fleets of business vehicles. A business can register a group of vehicles with TfL, and is charged &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 per visit for all vehicles in the fleet detected by the cameras. In May 2005, businessman Miguel Camacho set up fivepounds.co.uk, whose sole function was to sign up private drivers to their &quot;fleet&quot;, thus offering the convenience of not having to pay the charge pro-actively, avoiding fines in the case of a forgotten journey and also potentially getting a &quot;free journey&quot; if undetected by the cameras. TfL, which obtains nearly half of its net revenue from fines, moved quickly to quash the loophole, by demanding that fleet operators provide V5 <a href="log_book" title="wikilink">log books</a> for each vehicle in their fleet. Fivepounds went out of business on <a href="26_February" title="wikilink">26 February</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="penalties-and-avoidance">Penalties and avoidance</h3>
<p>Failure to pay results in a fine of &lt;U+00A3&gt;100, reduced to &lt;U+00A3&gt;50 if paid within 14 days, but increased to &lt;U+00A3&gt;150 if unpaid after 28 days.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Although avoidance has become more sophisticated, compliance with the scheme and terms of payment has improved over the last few years, as is evidenced by the income from penalties dropping by approximately a quarter between 2005 and 2007. However, even after charges were increased, enforcement charges still make up a significant proportion of the net revenues.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Several newspapers have reported that copied <a href="British_car_number_plates" title="wikilink">number plates</a> are being used to avoid the congestion charge, resulting in vehicle owners receiving penalty notices for failure to pay when their vehicles have not been inside the zone. TfL has stated it is keeping a database of these numbers and that they will trigger an alert.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, TfL was informed by the website Clean Green Cars that owners of luxury cars were registering their vehicles as minicabs in order to use the exemption for these vehicles. TfL responded that it carried out regular checks to confirm that cars were being used for the purposes they were registered for. It is not known how many vehicles have been registered in this way.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Drivers of foreign-registered vehicles are not exempt from the charge but the current lack of an international legal framework for the assessment and collection of traffic fines makes enforcement and recovery difficult. In 2005, <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> obtained documentation under the <a href="Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000" title="wikilink">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> which showed that out of 65,534 tickets issued to non UK registered vehicles, only 1,993 had been collected.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 2005, it was revealed that several London <a href="embassy" title="wikilink">embassies</a> were not paying the charge as they considered it to be a tax, which they are protected from paying under the <a href="Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations" title="wikilink">Vienna Convention</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Although some embassies agree to pay the charge,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> the US embassy currently owes &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.6 million (approximately $3 million) in fines for non-payment.

<h3 id="operations-and-technology">Operations and technology</h3>
<p>Whilst TfL is responsible for the scheme, the operation is sub-contracted to an outside company. From the scheme's inception, Capita Group has been responsible for its day-to-day operation under a five-year contract worth around &lt;U+00A3&gt;230m.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Having been threatened with the termination of the contract by Livingstone for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Capita has employed sub-contractors including <a href="Mastek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mastek</a>, based in <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a>, <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, who are responsible for much of the Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread around the globe of sub-contractors and because some data protection regulations vary from country to country, the scheme has prompted concerns about privacy from technology specialists.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Transport for London have announced that from 2009 <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a> will operate the charge, along with the <a href="London_low_emission_zone" title="wikilink">low emission zone</a> under contract.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The scheme makes use of <a href="Closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">CCTV</a> cameras to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% accuracy rate through <a href="automatic_number_plate_recognition" title="wikilink">automatic number plate recognition</a> (ANPR) technology.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> There are also a number of mobile camera units which may be deployed anywhere in the zone. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured on camera. The cameras take two still pictures in colour and black and white and use <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a> technology to identify the number plates. These identified numbers are checked against the list of <a href="payee" title="wikilink">payees</a> overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked by humans.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered owner of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the <a href="Driver_and_Vehicle_Licensing_Agency" title="wikilink">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (DVLA), based in <a href="Swansea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swansea</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The cameras can be fooled by <a href="tail_gating" title="wikilink">tail gating</a> or switching lanes at the correct time.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Cc-london-sign-out.jpg" title="fig:Signs indicate the boundary of the congestion charge area." alt="Signs indicate the boundary of the congestion charge area." /> Historically, private <a href="toll_roads" title="wikilink">toll roads</a>, funded by <a href="turnpike_trust" title="wikilink">turnpike trusts</a>, were common from the late 1600s until the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1888" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1888</a> passed ownership and responsibility to <a href="county_councils" title="wikilink">county</a> and <a href="county_borough" title="wikilink">county borough</a> councils.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> As a result the use of roads in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> is generally free of charge, subject to the payment of the <a href="road_fund_licence" title="wikilink">road fund licence</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, there are specific sections of public roads that remained tolled, which are mainly <a href="List_of_toll_bridges#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">bridges</a> and <a href="Toll_tunnel" title="wikilink">tunnels</a> as well as the <a href="M6_toll" title="wikilink">M6 toll</a> motorway.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Of the many previously existing toll roads in London<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> there remains one, College Road in <a href="Dulwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dulwich</a>, which is privately owned by <a href="Dulwich_College" title="wikilink">Dulwich College</a> but accessible by the public.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Road tolls have been advocated by many others in the past, such as the 18th century economist <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a>, as a way of directly funding the construction and maintenance of routes.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The <a href="Her_Majesty&#39;s_Government" title="wikilink">government</a>'s <a href="Smeed_Report" title="wikilink">Smeed Report</a> of 1964 was the first full assessment of the practicality of road pricing in a British city on the basis of congestion.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It recommended a method of &quot;car user restraint&quot; by a variable system of <a href="Road_pricing" title="wikilink">charging</a> for road usage - if the government had the will to do so. During the early years of the <a href="Greater_London_Council" title="wikilink">Greater London Council</a> the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> However, the newly elected <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a> council rejected the study's findings in favour of greater investment in <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public transport</a>. In 1995, the London Congestion Research Programme concluded that the city's economy would benefit from a congestion charge scheme,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and the <a href="Road_Traffic_Reduction_Act_1997" title="wikilink">Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997</a> required local authorities to study and reduce traffic volumes.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The power to introduce &quot;Road user charging&quot; was given to any future mayor in the <a href="Greater_London_Authority_Act_1999" title="wikilink">Greater London Authority Act 1999</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Having won the first mayoral election in 2000, <a href="Ken_Livingstone" title="wikilink">Ken Livingstone</a> opted to exercise these powers as promised in his independent manifesto,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and carried out a series of consultations with interested parties with the basic scheme agreed in February 2002.

<p>After the introduction of the charge, there were a number of suggestions for its future. Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge's success or failure six months after its introduction – brought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On <a href="25_February" title="wikilink">25 February</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> Livingstone stated, &quot;I can't conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where we would want to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary&quot; referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that &lt;U+00A3&gt;5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his earlier stance and said in an interview with BBC London, &quot;I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least &lt;U+00A3&gt;6.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> By the end of the month, Livingstone changed his position again, saying in an announcement that, in fact, the rise would be to &lt;U+00A3&gt;8 for private vehicles and &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 for commercial traffic.

<h3 id="western-extension">Western extension</h3>
<p>In February 2004, TfL issued a consultation document&lt;ref name=&quot;tfl20040216&gt;</ref> on the expansion of the zone to the west that would cover the rest (western portion) of Westminster and the <a href="Royal_Borough_of_Kensington_and_Chelsea" title="wikilink">Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</a>. The extension covered around 230,000 residents, compared with the 150,000 in the original zone.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <img src="Park_Lane_Road_sign.jpg" title="fig:Park Lane is one of the new free through routes." alt="Park Lane is one of the new free through routes." /> In August 2004, following Livingstone's re-election in the <a href="London_mayoral_election,_2004" title="wikilink">June 2004 mayoral election</a>, the results of the consultation were published. A substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> however Livingstone said he was going ahead and that the consultation was a charade.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Protests continued against the extension,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> with residents arguing that only 5% of the road space in the selected area was congested.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Following on in May 2005 TfL a further consultation began with specific proposals about the extensions. These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to &quot;boost trade at London's theatres, restaurants and cinemas&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> At the end of September 2005, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed the western expansion of the congestion charge, to come into effect on <a href="19_February" title="wikilink">19 February</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> despite the majority of residents opposing it in the two consultations.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> It was expected that the extension would increase congestion in the zone by around 5% as the 60,000 residents in the new zone will be entitled to the discounts available.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Several roads were also to be left charge-free between the original zone and the extension.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the introduction of the western extension, TfL has made a number of bus route changes to take advantage of the presumed higher traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transport. One new route (<a href="London_Buses_route_452" title="wikilink">route 452</a>) has been introduced and three others (routes <a href="London_Buses_route_31" title="wikilink">31</a>, <a href="London_Buses_route_46" title="wikilink">46</a> and <a href="London_Buses_route_430" title="wikilink">430</a>) have been extended.

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>The effects of the congestion charge have been controversial. Studies have been made of its effects on congestion, traffic levels, road safety, the use of public transport, the environment, and business activity matters.</p>
<h3 id="traffic">Traffic</h3>
<p>Before the charge's introduction, there were fears of a very chaotic few days as the charge bedded down. Indeed <a href="Ken_Livingstone" title="wikilink">Ken Livingstone</a>, <a href="Mayor_of_London" title="wikilink">Mayor of London</a> and key proponent of the charge, himself predicted a &quot;difficult few days&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> and a &quot;bloody day&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="immediate-effects">Immediate effects</h4>
<p>Historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour. The early days of congestion charging had little impact on this critical time.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> On the first day 190,000 vehicles moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> It was reported that the main effect occurred after 11 am.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15&lt;U+2013&gt;20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Initial suggestions that school holidays were responsible for part of the traffic drop during the first week of operation of the charge were confirmed when traffic rose again by 5% following the return to school at the beginning of the second week of the charge. Reports indicated that, over the first month or so of operation, traffic was consistently down at least 15% on pre-charge levels, with the second week seeing the reduction drop to 20%.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The <a href="AA_Motoring_Trust" title="wikilink">AA Motoring Trust</a> suggested that changes to the timing of traffic lights and the end of major <a href="road_works" title="wikilink">road works</a> had also impacted congestion.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="23_October" title="wikilink">23 October</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> TfL published a report reviewing the first six months of the charge. The report's main findings were that the average number of cars and delivery vehicles entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year, representing a drop in non-exempt vehicles of 30%. Around 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20&lt;U+2013&gt;30% to journeys avoiding the zone, and the remainder to car-sharing, reduced number of journeys, more traveling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and bicycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 15%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased. The report said that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the drop in retail sales.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The report also stated that around 100,000 penalty fines were issued each month, of which about 2,000 were contested.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>By comparison, an experimental short-term congestion charge in Stockholm saw an average 25% reduction in traffic numbers.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="longer-term-effects">Longer term effects</h4>
<p><img src="481142_bd7544d2.jpg" title="fig:Traffic congestion on the A4 part of the extended zone." alt="Traffic congestion on the A4 part of the extended zone." /> A year before the congestion zone, TfL set up automatic traffic counters and augmented them with regular classified traffic counts at key locations, in order to monitor long term trends.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Their results are reviewed and reported annually.</p>
<p>A report by TfL in early 2007 indicated that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before the introduction of the congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> (Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year proceeding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a>)</p>
<p>TfL's report in June 2007 found that the level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was now consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The <a href="conservative" class="uri" title="wikilink">conservative</a> <a href="Bow_Group" title="wikilink">Bow Group</a> noted that the main effect occurred after 11 am.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Breaking down that figure showed the number of chargeable vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9.30 am and a peak immediately before and after the end of the charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. Once within the charging zone car and delivery traffic remained unchanged, suggesting that the journeys made by residents and businesses within the zone were broadly unaffected. Changes to the road network over the years has made direct comparisons difficult, but TfL suspect that certain routes used heavily by taxis and buses within the zone have seen substantially increased traffic. On some of the boundary roads traffic numbers had increased slightly but congestion and delays were largely unchanged from 2002 levels. Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The charge operates for under one third of the hours in a year and covers around two thirds of the central London traffic.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In total 8% of traffic kilometres are affected by t scheme.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> TfL have extrapolated the trends in road speed in the congestion zone; they have suggested that speeds would have dropped from 17 km/h in 2003 to 11.5 km/h by 2006, had the scheme not been put in place.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the introduction of the Western Extension, TfL stated that traffic had fallen around 10 to 15% in the extended zone.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The original zone is showing a 4% increase in congestion following expansion of the congestion charge and the introduction of extended to discounts to residents of the new zone and buffer zone.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> TfL assessed the increase in charges in 2005 to have had only a slight impact overall.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Although it was suggested that the scheme should improve the speed of vehicles in the centre, the <a href="London_Ambulance_Service" title="wikilink">London Ambulance Service</a> (LAS) anticipated increased volumes of traffic around the edge of the zone and an increase in demand within the zone, that might both adversely affect clinical outcomes.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> However, since then, survival rates for LAS' witnessed cardiac arrests have tripled across Greater London. LAS attributes these improvements to equipment availability and operational processes, such as the deployment of four-wheeled and two-wheeled rapid response units that can weave through congestion more quickly.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> This, and TfL's increase in the number central London traffic calming measures, would suggest that other much more significant factors have masked any congestion charge-related changes in outcome, either up or down. In addition, like some other essential services, LAS felt it necessary to divert about &lt;U+00A3&gt;&lt;U+00BC&gt;M from their budget to pay congestion charge allowances for key staff affected by the charges during their journey to work.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>A further report published by TfL in October 2004 stated that only seven of the 13 government aims for London transport would be met by 2010. The target on reducing congestion for <a href="Greater_London" title="wikilink">Greater London</a> overall will not be met, the report said.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="road-safety">Road safety</h3>
<p>TfL have estimated that the charge appeared to have a small impact on the number of road traffic accidents – but this was much less than the national and London trend towards fewer accidents. There were 2,598 personal injury <a href="road_traffic_accident" title="wikilink">road traffic accidents</a> inside the zone in the year before the scheme. This fell by about 200 each year to 1,629 in 2005. TfL's statisticians have extrapolated an estimate that between 40 and 70 injuries have been avoided annually because of the charging zone, with most of the rest attributed to the changes that altered and slowed down the road network &quot;in favour of the people-moving capacity of the network.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>TfL expects that many of these road safety interventions would have occurred irrespective of the introduction of congestion charging. Cars and motorcycles have seen the biggest reduction in accidents, whereas bicyclists have seen a slight increase, which perhaps reflects their increased numbers. For comparison, the inner ring road also saw a substantial drop as accidents fell from 961 to 632, which was slightly less than the average for Greater London.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="public-transport">Public transport</h3>
<p>On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 20,000) were introduced.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Bus and <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London Underground</a> managers reported that buses and tubes were little, if at all, busier than normal.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Usage of the <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London Underground</a> has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003/2004, whilst bus patronage in the <a href="Central_London" title="wikilink">Central London</a> area (not the same at the Congestion Charge Zone) had stabilised at 116,000 journeys per day after increasing from under 90,000 pre-charge. No change in <a href="National_Rail" title="wikilink">National Rail</a> patronage had been noted as a result of the introduction of the central zone charge.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="business">Business</h3>
<p>Reports have shops and businesses being heavily impacted by the cost of the charge, both in terms of lost sales and increased delivery costs as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><img src="Broadgate_aerial_1.jpg" title="fig:tower|upright|The City of London, the world&#39;s pre-eminent financial centre is covered by the congestion charge." alt="tower|upright|The City of London, the world&#39;s pre-eminent financial centre is covered by the congestion charge." /> In August 2003, the <a href="John_Lewis_Partnership" title="wikilink">John Lewis Partnership</a> announced that in the first six months of the charge's operation, sales at their <a href="Oxford_Street" title="wikilink">Oxford Street</a> store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular <a href="Sunday_shopping" title="wikilink">Sunday opening</a> for the first time.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>However London First's own report indicated that business was broadly supportive.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Subsequently another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the charging zone.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>A report in May 2005 stated that the number of shoppers had declined by 7% year-on-year in March, 8% in April and 11% in the first two weeks of May. TfL countered that an <a href="economic_downturn" title="wikilink">economic downturn</a>, the <a href="Progress_of_the_SARS_outbreak" title="wikilink">SARS outbreak</a> and threat of <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a> were likely factors. At the same time a <a href="London_Chamber_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">London Chamber of Commerce</a> report indicated that 25% of businesses were planning on relocation following the charges introduction.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> However an independent report six months after the charge was implemented suggested that businesses were then supporting the charge. London First commissioned the study which reported that 49% of businesses felt the scheme was working and only 16% that it was failing.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The Fourth Annual Review by TfL in 2004 indicated that business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both <a href="productivity" class="uri" title="wikilink">productivity</a> and <a href="profitability" class="uri" title="wikilink">profitability</a> and that the charge had a &quot;broadly neutral impact&quot; on the London wide <a href="economy" class="uri" title="wikilink">economy</a>.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The Fifth Annual Review continued to show the central congestion zone outperforming the wider London economy.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>National trends had already shown a rapid decline of some other emissions during the late 1990s, notably <a href="carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide</a>, and levels have been relatively stable since 2002 across London. Since 2002 the <a href="nitrogen_dioxide" title="wikilink">nitrogen dioxide</a> (NO<sub>2</sub>) produced by diesel exhaust has become a serious problem, with the <a href="London_Air_Quality_Network" title="wikilink">London Air Quality Network</a> of <a href="King&#39;s_College_London" title="wikilink">King's College London</a> reporting that the annual mean NO<sub>2</sub> objective (of 40 &lt;U+03BC&gt;gm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006. Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO<sub>2</sub> levels above an upper limit of 200 &lt;U+03BC&gt;gm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the zone boundary experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the <a href="A23_road" title="wikilink">A23</a> near Brixton (3741 hours) and the <a href="Marylebone_Road" title="wikilink">Marylebone Road</a> (849 hours).<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> TfL report that emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality and that vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along with weather conditions and industrial use.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> It was also reported that pollutant concentrations were being effected by the change in the make up of the vehicle fleet.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Preliminary reports also indicate the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Further studies are being undertaken into the air quality effects.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Bus_congestion_on_New_Oxford_Street.jpg" title="fig:Long queues of buses, many funded by the congestion charge." alt="Long queues of buses, many funded by the congestion charge." /> TfL's annual report for 2006–7 shows that revenues from the congestion charge were &lt;U+00A3&gt;252.4m over the financial year, representing 8.5% of TfL's annual revenues. More than half of this was spent on the cost of running the toll system, at &lt;U+00A3&gt;130.1 million. Once other charges were deducted, the congestion charge brought in an annual operating <a href="net_income" title="wikilink">net income</a> of &lt;U+00A3&gt;89.1m for TfL.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> (This income compares with TfL's total revenue from bus and tube fares of &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,269.4m, or 76.6% of revenue before costs, or grants from central government of &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,390.3 million.)</p>
<p>By law, all surpluses raised must be reinvested into London's transport infrastructure; at the start of the scheme it was anticipated that this would be around &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 million.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> According to a report issued in February 2007, the initial costs of setting up the scheme were &lt;U+00A3&gt;161.7 million,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> with an annual operating cost of about &lt;U+00A3&gt;115m anticipated.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Total revenues over the first three and a half years had been &lt;U+00A3&gt;677.4 million, with TfL reporting a surplus over operating costs of &lt;U+00A3&gt;189.7 million.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>The initial operating revenues from the congestion charge did not reach the levels that were originally expected.

<p>The June 2005 increase in charges by 60% only resulted in a relatively small rise in revenues, as there were fewer penalty payments. The anticipated start up costs of the Western extension were &lt;U+00A3&gt;125 million with operating costs of &lt;U+00A3&gt;33m; expected <a href="gross_revenue" title="wikilink">gross revenues</a> were expected to be &lt;U+00A3&gt;80 million resulting in <a href="net_revenue" title="wikilink">net revenues</a> of &lt;U+00A3&gt;50 million.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

<p>Although Parliament has limited the amount that authorities can borrow, for some time it had been speculated that the regular income obtained from the congestion charge and other revenues could be used to <a href="Securitization" title="wikilink">securitise</a> a <a href="bond_issue" title="wikilink">bond issue</a> that finances other transport projects across London.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> TfL issued their first bond for &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 million in 2005, to be repaid at 5% interest over 30 years. TfL plans to borrow &lt;U+00A3&gt;3.1 billion more to fund a 5-year transport programme across London, including works on London Underground and road safety schemes.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reaction">Reaction</h2>
<p>A few days before the scheme came into operation, Steve Norris criticised it, writing in a BBC report that it had been &quot;shambolically organised&quot;, that the <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public transport</a> network had insufficient spare capacity to cater for travellers deterred from using their cars in the area by the charge. Further, he said that the scheme would affect poorer sections of society more than the rich, with the daily charge being the same for all, regardless of vehicle size.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>The charge has proved controversial in the outer areas of London, where it has encouraged commuters who previously drove into central London to instead park at suburban railway or underground stations. This has been accompanied by the introduction of extra on-street parking restrictions and controlled parking zones in these areas, at the expense of local residents.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>

<p>No further extension to the geographical zone is currently planned. However, towards the end of 2006, Livingstone proposed the introduction of a variable congestion charge, based on the <a href="Vehicle_Excise_Duty" title="wikilink">Vehicle Excise Duty</a> (VED) bands. This would reduce or eliminate the charge for <em>Band A</em> vehicles, and increase it to up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;25 a day for <em>Band G</em> vehicles, that is, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of greater than 225 g/km.
