<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Bedford AFS was established by <a href="Air_Defense_Command" title="wikilink">Air Defense Command</a> in 1954 as part of a planned deployment of forty-four Phase I Mobile Radar stations. It was one of twenty-nine stations which were sited around the perimeter of the country to support the permanent ADC network of seventy-five stations. The deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment The 649th Airborne Control and Warning Squadron achieved beneficial occupancy by 1 December 1954. Operational status was achieved in 1956 with the activation of the <a href="AN/MPS-8" class="uri" title="wikilink">AN/MPS-8</a> and <a href="AN/MPS-11" class="uri" title="wikilink">AN/MPS-11</a> radars.</p>
<p>By 1958 the AN/MPS-8 had been superseded by a pair of <a href="AN/FPS-6" class="uri" title="wikilink">AN/FPS-6</a> height-finder radars. In 1959 an <a href="AN/FPS-20" title="wikilink">AN/FPS-20A</a> search radar replaced the AN/MPS-11 set. In addition, Bedford AFS joined the <a href="SAGE_system" title="wikilink">SAGE system</a> and the squadron was redesigated as the <a href="649th_Radar_Squadron" title="wikilink">649th Radar Squadron</a>.</p>
<p>In 1960 this site also began performing air traffic control duties for the <a href="FAA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FAA</a>. In 1963 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an <a href="AN/FPS-67" class="uri" title="wikilink">AN/FPS-67</a>. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-121.</p>
<p>The 649th was deactivated and the Air Force closed the facility on 30 June 1975. Afterward the FAA took over the facility, and today it is an active <a href="Joint_Surveillance_System" title="wikilink">Joint Surveillance System</a> (JSS) site, now operating an <a href="ARSR-3" class="uri" title="wikilink">ARSR-3</a> Long Range Air Route Surveillance Radar. Most of the buildings on the site have been torn down, the housing and GATR site have been obliterated as well.</p>
