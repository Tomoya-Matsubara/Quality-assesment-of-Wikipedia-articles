<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The building originated as a farmhouse in the late 16th century. In the middle of the 17th century a group of <a href="Independent_(religion)" title="wikilink">Independent</a> Christians was meeting in the nearby village of Cookley. Following the passing of the <a href="Act_of_Toleration_1689" title="wikilink">Act of Toleration</a> in 1689, which gave the right of freedom of worship to <a href="Nonconformism" title="wikilink">Nonconformists</a>, six trustees from the group took out a lease on the building and the surrounding  of land, and converted the farmhouse into a chapel.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In about 1700 an extension was added to the back of the building.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Over the years attendance at the chapel declined, this not being helped by the establishment of an Independent chapel in the nearby town of <a href="Halesworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halesworth</a>. In the 1860s the building, by then a <a href="Congregational_church" title="wikilink">Congregational</a> chapel, was taken over by <a href="Primitive_Methodism" title="wikilink">Primitive Methodists</a>. Numbers continued to decline during the 20th century, and in 1958 the trusteeship was passed to the Suffolk Congregational Union, the chapel finally closing in 1970. The building remained unused, and in 1995 it came into the care of the Historic Chapels Trust.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
