<p>The <strong>West London Free School</strong> is an English <a href="Free_school_(England)" title="wikilink">free school</a> for girls and boys aged 11 to 18. It was co-founded by <a href="Toby_Young" title="wikilink">Toby Young</a> and opened in 2011.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It is located in <a href="Hammersmith" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hammersmith</a> in west <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> and was the first free school of its type in Britain to sign a Funding Agreement with the <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Education" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for Education</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The West London Free School offers children a classical liberal education, that is, it expects every pupil to study a core of academically rigorous subjects, regardless of background or ability, but with plenty of art, music, drama and sport thrown in. On its website it states that it is a school &quot;with high expectations, strong discipline and an academically rigorous curriculum but which is open to all, regardless of income, ability or faith.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The head teacher is Sam Naismith, a former England hockey coach.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The school was formally opened by Mayor of London <a href="Boris_Johnson" title="wikilink">Boris Johnson</a> in September 2011 and is currently home to 360 pupils. It received over 1,150 applicants for its last 120 places, making it one of the most oversubscribed taxpayer-funded schools in England.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The school is currently based in Cambridge Grove, Hammersmith, but is planning to make its permanent home in Palingswick House on King Street.</p>
<p>It was inspected by Ofsted in July 2013 and was judged to be good with outstanding features.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p><img src="Toby_Young_with_West_London_Free_School_students.jpg" title="fig:Toby Young, co-founder of the West London Free School." alt="Toby Young, co-founder of the West London Free School." width="200" /> In addition to criticism of the free school concept generally, the West London Free School was criticised in <em>The Guardian</em> for hoping to make its permanent site Palingswick House in Hammersmith, a building then occupied by a number of community groups.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Hammersmith MP <a href="Andy_Slaughter" title="wikilink">Andy Slaughter</a> added his voice to the criticism, arguing that &quot;local people are against the plans&quot;, and stating that the school was &quot;ousting 22 charities and a school for severely disabled children in its rush to open&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, Toby Young pointed out that Palingswick House was listed for disposal by <a href="Hammersmith_and_Fulham_Borough_Council" title="wikilink">Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council</a> long before the West London Free School came into existence and, had the school not subsequently expressed an interest in it, it would likely have been sold off to a property developer and possibly demolished.</p>
<p>Opponents of free schools have also challenged perceived shortcomings in <a href="freedom_of_information" title="wikilink">freedom of information</a> access related to the development of free schools including the West London Free School.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter Winter, the ex-headmaster of <a href="Latymer_Upper_School" title="wikilink">Latymer Upper School</a>, criticised the proposal to base the West London Free School at Palingswick House, a neighbouring property, on the grounds that increased traffic to the area might threaten pupil safety.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the current head of <a href="Latymer_Upper_School" title="wikilink">Latymer Upper School</a>, David Goodhew, has been more supportive.</p>
