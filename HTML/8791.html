<p>&quot;<strong>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</strong>&quot; is a <a href="sermon" class="uri" title="wikilink">sermon</a> written by <a href="Thirteen_Colonies" title="wikilink">American</a> theologian <a href="Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="wikilink">Jonathan Edwards</a>, preached on July 8, 1741 in <a href="Enfield,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Enfield, Connecticut</a>. Like Edwards' other sermons and writings, it combines vivid imagery of the <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> concept of <a href="Hell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hell</a> with observations of the secular world and citations of <a href="The_Bible" title="wikilink">scripture</a>. It remains Edwards' most famous written work, and is widely studied both among American <a href="Christians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christians</a> and historians, due to the glimpse it provides into the theology of the <a href="First_Great_Awakening" title="wikilink">Great Awakening</a> of c. 1730&lt;U+2013&gt;1755.</p>
<h2 id="doctrine">Doctrine</h2>
<p><strong>&quot;<em>There is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell, but the mere pleasure of God.</em>&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Most of the sermon's text consists of eleven &quot;considerations&quot;, which Edwards acquires from the Holy Scripture, the Word of God as his ultimate reference: They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>God may cast wicked men into <a href="hell" class="uri" title="wikilink">hell</a> at any given moment.</li>
<li>The Wicked deserve to be cast into hell. Divine justice does not prevent God destroying the Wicked at any moment.</li>
<li>The Wicked, at <em>this</em> moment, suffer under God's condemnation to Hell.</li>
<li>The Wicked, on earth - at this very moment - suffer the torments of Hell. The Wicked must not think, simply because they are not physically in Hell, God (in whose Hand the Wicked now reside) is - at this very moment - as angry with <em>them</em> as He is with those miserable creatures He is <em>now</em> tormenting in hell, and who - at this very moment - do feel and bear the fierceness of His wrath.</li>
<li>At any moment God shall permit him, Satan stands ready to fall upon the Wicked and seize them as his own</li>
<li>If it were not for God's restraints, there are, in the souls of wicked men, hellish principles reigning which, presently, would kindle and flame out into hellfire,</li>
<li>Simply because there are not visible means of death before them, at any given moment, the Wicked should not, therefore, feel secure.</li>
<li>Simply because it is natural to care for oneself or to think that others may care for them, men should not think themselves safe from God's wrath.</li>
<li>All that wicked men may do to save themselves from Hell's pains afford them nothing if they continue to reject Christ.</li>
<li>God has never promised to save us from Hell, except for those contained in Christ through the covenant of Grace.</li>
<li>The wicked will not escape the wrath of God unless they repent.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>In the final section of &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot;Edwards wishes to show his theological argument at work throughout scripture and biblical history. This is done at length, invoking stories and examples throughout the whole of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> and comprises the bulk of this section. Edwards ends the sermon with one final appeal, &quot;Therefore let everyone that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come.&quot; Without explicitly saying, Edwards indirectly gives a sense of hope to those currently out of Christ. Only by returning to Christ can one escape the stark fate outlined by Edwards.</p>
<h2 id="effect-of-the-sermon">Effect of the sermon</h2>
<p>&quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; is a typical sermon of the Great Awakening, emphasizing the widely held belief that Hell is a real and functional place. Edwards hoped that the imagery and message of his sermon would awaken his audience to the horrific reality that he argued awaited them should they continue without Christ.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The underlying point, is that God has given humanity a chance to rectify their sins. Edwards says that it is the will of God that keeps wicked men from the depths of Hell; this act of restraint has given humanity a chance to change their ways and return to Christ.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Jonathan Edwards' sermon continues to be the leading example of a Great Awakening sermon and is still used in religious and academic settings today.</p>
