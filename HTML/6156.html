<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The headland known as Ram's Head overlooks the entrance to Cork Harbour - one of the world's largest natural harbours, and historically of strategic defensive and naval importance to Ireland and the region.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The first harbour defences built at Ram's Head date from 1550 and were originally known as <em>James' Battery</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This fortification was extended in 1600, but fell into disuse after the <a href="Nine_Years&#39;_War_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nine Years' War</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The fort was reinforced in 1690 to <a href="Siege_of_Cork" title="wikilink">defend Cork Harbour</a> during the <a href="Williamite_War_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">Williamite War in Ireland</a>, but a party secretly came ashore and took the fort in an overland assault.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The ports at Cork and Kinsale were later captured by forces under the Williamite <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Duke of Marlborough</a>.</p>
<p>By the Napoleonic War (1779) the defences were known as the <em>Ram's Head Battery</em>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and upgraded and remodelled to compliment other installations at <a href="Haulbowline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haulbowline</a>, Spike Island (Fort Westmoreland/Mitchell) and Whitegate (Fort Carlisle/Davis). In 1795 these fortifications were named <em>Fort Camden</em> for <a href="John_Pratt,_1st_Marquess_Camden" title="wikilink">John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden</a>, then <a href="Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="CamdenFortMeagherCorkLowerSeafrontGateway.JPG" title="fig:Gateway from pier area to lower courtyard" alt="Gateway from pier area to lower courtyard" /> By the 1830s, Fort Camden had been reduced to a token force, and the fort was briefly repurposed as a prison.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, a Royal Commission in the 1850s gave renewed consideration to the strategic importance of the harbour, and proposed enhancements to landward defences and seaward gun batteries.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This construction work started in 1861 - using convict, military and civilian labour. The fort was extended to 45 acres - 65% of structures being constructed underground.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The current structures of the fort are attributable primarily to these works.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1880s and 1890s the guns were upgraded with breech-loading rifled guns, newer larger cannon were installed, a minefield was laid across the channel and a launching position was added for the &quot;world's first <em>practical</em> guided weapon&quot;, the &quot;<a href="Brennan_Torpedo" title="wikilink">Brennan Torpedo</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the western approaches, an anti-submarine net was added and further upgrades were applied to harbour defences. After the <a href="Irish_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Irish War of Independence</a>, under the <a href="Anglo-Irish_Treaty" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> the harbour defences remained in the control of British government. These <a href="Treaty_Ports_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Treaty Port installations</a>, including Fort Camden, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in July 1938. The fort was renamed <em>Fort Meagher</em> for <a href="Thomas_Francis_Meagher" title="wikilink">Thomas Francis Meagher</a> - who had fought in the <a href="Young_Irelander_Rebellion_of_1848" title="wikilink">Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848</a>. (Similarly, &quot;Fort Westmoreland&quot; on Spike Island was renamed &quot;Fort Mitchell&quot;, and &quot;Fort Carlisle&quot; at Whitegate was renamed &quot;Fort Davis&quot;).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>During &quot;<a href="the_Emergency_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">the Emergency</a>&quot; (1939-1945), elements of the Coastal Defence Artillery (CDA) of the <a href="Artillery_Corps_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Irish Artillery Corps</a> operated from the fort and the nearby Templebreedy Battery.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By the mid- to late-20th Century the CDA was merged into other artillery regiments of the <a href="Irish_Army" title="wikilink">Irish Army</a>, and the fort was used primarily for training of <a href="Civil_Defence_Ireland" title="wikilink">Civil Defence</a> and <a href="Reserve_Defence_Forces" title="wikilink">Reserve Defence Forces</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the 1980s the army handed-over the fort to the local civil administration authority, <a href="Cork_County_Council" title="wikilink">Cork County Council</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The facility remained disused however, and became overgrown and derelict in the following decades. In 2010 Cork County Council afforded a lease to community members from Crosshaven,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> who instrumented a volunteer campaign to clear, conserve, redevelop and operate the fort as a heritage tourism site.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="CamdenFortMeagherCorkReenactorsDisplay.JPG" title="fig:Historical reenactors on the fort&#39;s parade ground" alt="Historical reenactors on the fort&#39;s parade ground" /> From 2010, under a &quot;Rescue Camden&quot; banner, a community group of volunteers began reclaiming and restoring Camden Fort Meagher. With input from Cork County Council, <a href="Foras_&lt;U+00C1&gt;iseanna_Saothair" title="wikilink">Foras &lt;U+00C1&gt;iseanna Saothair</a> (the Training and Employment Authority), and other partners, the group began to clean, restore, develop and (ultimately) operate the fort as a tourism and heritage centre. Some of these works were covered in documentary programming by <a href="Raidi&lt;U+00F3&gt;_Teilif&lt;U+00ED&gt;s_&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann" title="wikilink">RT&lt;U+00C9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As of 2014, the fort is opened to visitors - but limited to weekends between June to September.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>A significant portion of the site has been restored for self-guided and guided tours - though several areas are not accessible to visitors with reduced mobility. A number of exhibits and installations cover the British and Irish military heritage of the fort, and the site houses the only resident 9/11 exhibit outside of the United States.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> There is a caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; with views of the harbour mouth, and <a href="historical_reenactment" title="wikilink">historical reenactment</a> events are occasionally held on the parade square.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
