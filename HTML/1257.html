<p>The <strong>Wicklow Mountains</strong> (,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="archaism" title="wikilink">archaic</a>: <em>Cualu</em>) form the largest continuous upland area in <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. They occupy the whole centre of <a href="County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">County Wicklow</a> and stretch outside its borders into Counties <a href="County_Carlow" title="wikilink">Carlow</a>, <a href="County_Wexford" title="wikilink">Wexford</a> and <a href="County_Dublin" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>. Where the mountains extend into County Dublin, they are known locally as the <strong>Dublin Mountains</strong> ().<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The highest peak is <a href="Lugnaquilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugnaquilla</a> at .</p>
<p>The mountains are primarily composed of <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a> surrounded by an envelope of <a href="mica" class="uri" title="wikilink">mica</a>-<a href="schist" class="uri" title="wikilink">schist</a> and much older rocks such as <a href="quartzite" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartzite</a>. They were pushed up during the <a href="Caledonian_orogeny" title="wikilink">Caledonian orogeny</a> at the start of the <a href="Devonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devonian</a> period and form part of the Leinster Chain, the largest continuous area of granite in Ireland and Britain. The mountains owe much of their present topography to the effects of the <a href="Quaternary_glaciation" title="wikilink">last ice age</a>, which deepened the valleys and created <a href="cirque" title="wikilink">corrie</a> and <a href="ribbon_lake" title="wikilink">ribbon</a> lakes. <a href="Copper" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copper</a> and <a href="lead" class="uri" title="wikilink">lead</a> have been the main metals mined in the mountains and a brief <a href="gold_rush" title="wikilink">gold rush</a> occurred in the 18th century.</p>
<p>Several major <a href="drainage_system_(geomorphology)" title="wikilink">river systems</a> have their source in the mountains, such as the <a href="River_Liffey" title="wikilink">Liffey</a>, <a href="River_Dargle" title="wikilink">Dargle</a>, <a href="River_Slaney" title="wikilink">Slaney</a> and <a href="River_Avoca" title="wikilink">Avoca</a> rivers. <a href="Powerscourt_Waterfall" title="wikilink">Powerscourt Waterfall</a> is the tallest in Ireland at . A number of these rivers have been harnessed to create <a href="reservoir" title="wikilink">reservoirs</a> for <a href="drinking_water" title="wikilink">drinking water</a> for Dublin and its surroundings.</p>
<p>The Wicklow Mountains experience a <a href="temperate" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperate</a> <a href="oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">oceanic climate</a> with mild, damp summers and cool, wet winters. The dominant habitat of the uplands consists of <a href="blanket_bog" title="wikilink">blanket bog</a>, <a href="heath" class="uri" title="wikilink">heath</a> and upland <a href="grassland" class="uri" title="wikilink">grassland</a>. The uplands support a number of threatened bird species, including <a href="merlin_(bird)" title="wikilink">merlin</a> and <a href="peregrine_falcon" title="wikilink">peregrine falcon</a>. The valleys are a mixture of <a href="temperate_coniferous_forest" title="wikilink">coniferous</a> and <a href="temperate_deciduous_forest" title="wikilink">deciduous</a> woodland.</p>
<p>The mountains have been inhabited since <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> times and a number of typical monuments, in particular a series of <a href="passage_tomb" title="wikilink">passage tombs</a>, survive to the present day. The <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> at <a href="Glendalough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glendalough</a>, founded in the late 6th century by <a href="Kevin_of_Glendalough" title="wikilink">Saint Kevin</a>, was an important centre of the <a href="Celtic_Christianity" title="wikilink">Early Church in Ireland</a>. Following the <a href="Normans" title="wikilink">Norman</a> invasion in the 12th century, the Wicklow Mountains became a stronghold and hiding place for Irish <a href="clan" title="wikilink">clans</a> opposed to English rule. The <a href="O&#39;Byrne_family" title="wikilink">O'Byrne</a> and <a href="O&#39;Toole_family" title="wikilink">O'Toole</a> families carried out a campaign of harassment against the settlers for almost five centuries. Later the mountains harboured rebels during the <a href="Irish_rebellion_of_1798" title="wikilink">1798 Rising</a>. Rebel activity died out after the construction of the <a href="R115_road" title="wikilink">Wicklow Military Road</a> at the start of the 19th century and the mountains began to attract <a href="tourism" title="wikilink">tourists</a> to the ruins at Glendalough and to admire the mountain scenery.</p>
<p>The Wicklow Mountains continue to be a major attraction for tourism and recreation. The entire upland area is designated as a <a href="Special_Area_of_Conservation" title="wikilink">Special Area of Conservation</a> and as a <a href="Special_Protection_Area" title="wikilink">Special Protection Area</a> under <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> law. The <a href="Wicklow_Mountains_National_Park" title="wikilink">Wicklow Mountains National Park</a> was established in 1991 to conserve the local <a href="biodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a> and landscape.</p>
<h2 id="toponymy">Toponymy</h2>
<p>The Wicklow Mountains take their name from <a href="County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">County Wicklow</a> which in turn takes its name from <a href="Wicklow" title="wikilink">Wicklow town</a>. The origin of the name is from the <a href="Danish_language" title="wikilink">Danish</a> <em>Wykynglo</em> or <em>Wykinlo</em>. The Irish name for Wicklow, <em></em>, means &quot;Church of Mantan&quot;, named after an apostle of <a href="Saint_Patrick" title="wikilink">Saint Patrick</a>. Wicklow was not established as a county until 1606; prior to that it had been part of <a href="County_Dublin" title="wikilink">County Dublin</a>. An early name for the whole area of the Wicklow Mountains was <em>Cualu</em>. There are also historic names for various territories in the mountains held by local <a href="clan" title="wikilink">clans</a>: the north part of Wicklow and south Dublin was known as <em>Cualann</em> while the <a href="Glen_of_Imaal" title="wikilink">Glen of Imaal</a> takes its name from the territory of <em>Hy Mail</em>. A <a href="sept" class="uri" title="wikilink">sept</a> of the <a href="O&#39;Byrne_family" title="wikilink">O'Byrne family</a> called the Gaval Rannall possessed the area around <a href="Glenmalure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glenmalure</a>, known as <em>Gaval-Rannall</em> or <em>Ranelagh</em>. During the medieval period, prior to the establishment of County Wicklow, the English administration in Dublin referred to the region as the Leinster Mountains.</p>

<p><img src="Lugnaquilla_from_Glenmalure.jpg" title="fig:Lugnaquilla, Wicklow&#39;s highest mountain" alt="Lugnaquilla, Wicklow&#39;s highest mountain" /> The Wicklow Mountains are the largest area of continuous high ground in Ireland, having an unbroken area of over  above 300 metres (1,000 feet). They occupy the centre of <a href="County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">County Wicklow</a> and extend into Counties <a href="County_Dublin" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, <a href="County_Carlow" title="wikilink">Carlow</a> and <a href="County_Wexford" title="wikilink">Wexford</a>. The general direction of the mountain ranges is from north-east to south-west. They are formed into several distinct groups: that of <a href="Kippure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kippure</a> in the north, on the boundary of Dublin and Wicklow; <a href="Djouce" class="uri" title="wikilink">Djouce</a>, <a href="Tonelagee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tonelagee</a>, <a href="Camaderry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camaderry</a> and <a href="Lugnaquilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugnaquilla</a> in the centre; <a href="Church_Mountain" title="wikilink">Church Mountain</a> and <a href="Keadeen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keadeen</a> in the west; and <a href="Croghan_Mountain" title="wikilink">Croghan Kinsella</a> to the south.

The oldest rocks are the quartzites of the Bray Group that include <a href="Bray_Head" title="wikilink">Bray Head</a> and the <a href="Little_Sugar_Loaf" title="wikilink">Little Sugar Loaf</a> and <a href="Great_Sugar_Loaf" title="wikilink">Great Sugar Loaf</a> mountains. These <a href="metamorphism" title="wikilink">metamorphosed</a> from <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a> deposited in the deep waters of the primeval <a href="Iapetus_Ocean" title="wikilink">Iapetus Ocean</a> during the <a href="Cambrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambrian</a> <a href="period_(geology)" title="wikilink">period</a> (542-488 million years ago). Layers of sediment continued to form <a href="slate" title="wikilink">slates</a> and <a href="shales" class="uri" title="wikilink">shales</a> along the ocean floor mixed with <a href="volcanic_rock" title="wikilink">volcanic rock</a> pushed up as Iapetus began to shrink by the process of <a href="subduction" class="uri" title="wikilink">subduction</a> during the <a href="Ordovician" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ordovician</a> period (488-443 million years ago). These rocks now underlie the uplifted <a href="peneplain" class="uri" title="wikilink">peneplain</a> of the Vartry Plateau between the Bray Group and the main range.</p>
<p>Iapetus closed up completely at the end of the <a href="Silurian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silurian</a> period (443-415 million years ago) and the Wicklow Mountains were <a href="tectonic_uplift" title="wikilink">uplifted</a> during the main phase of the <a href="Caledonian_orogeny" title="wikilink">Caledonian orogeny</a> at the start of the <a href="Devonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devonian</a> period (415-358 million years ago) when the continents of <a href="Baltica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baltica</a> and <a href="Laurentia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laurentia</a> <a href="continental_collision" title="wikilink">collided</a>. The collision pushed up a large <a href="batholith" class="uri" title="wikilink">batholith</a> of granite, known as the Leinster Chain: this is the largest continuous area of granite in Ireland and Britain and runs from the coast at <a href="Dun_Laoghaire" title="wikilink">Dun Laoghaire</a> in County Dublin to <a href="New_Ross" title="wikilink">New Ross</a> in County Wexford and includes the Wicklow and <a href="Blackstairs_Mountains" title="wikilink">Blackstairs</a> Mountains. The heat generated by the collision metamorphosed the slates and shales surrounding the granite into <a href="schist" title="wikilink">schists</a> which formed an aureole (shell) around the granite. The process of <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> has removed much of the surrounding schist from the mountain tops, exposing the underlying granite. Some remnants of the schist roof remain on some of the mountain tops, most notably <a href="Lugnaquilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugnaquilla</a>. The round granite topped peaks contrast with the sharper schist peaks: for example, <a href="War_Hill" title="wikilink">War Hill</a> (granite) and <a href="Djouce" class="uri" title="wikilink">Djouce</a> (schist).</p>
<p><img src="Upper_and_Lower_Lough_Bray.jpg" title="fig:The twin corrie lakes of Lough Bray" alt="The twin corrie lakes of Lough Bray" /> The last major geological event to shape the Wicklow Mountains was the <a href="Quaternary_glaciation" title="wikilink">Quaternary glaciation</a> during the <a href="Pleistocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pleistocene</a> <a href="epoch_(geology)" title="wikilink">epoch</a> (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). The ice <a href="overdeepening" title="wikilink">deepened</a> and moulded the valleys into the <a href="U-shaped_valley" title="wikilink">U-shape</a> that characterises the Wicklow Glens, such as <a href="Glendalough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glendalough</a> and Glenmacnass. As the ice melted, small glaciers were left in <a href="cirque" title="wikilink">corries</a> where <a href="moraine" title="wikilink">moraines</a> now dam lakes such as at Loughs Bray and Nahanagan. Corries without lakes also occur, such as the North Prison and South Prison of Lugnaquilla.

<h3 id="mining-and-quarrying">Mining and quarrying</h3>
<p>The zone of collision between the continental plates that led to the formation of the Wicklow Mountains also led to <a href="mineralization_(geology)" title="wikilink">mineralisation</a> and the formation of Ireland's most significant metalliferous belt. The most important mining sites have been at <a href="Avoca,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Avoca</a> and <a href="Glendalough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glendalough</a>. Mining has taken place at Avoca since at least the <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a> (c. 2,500-600 BCE). <a href="Iron_ore" title="wikilink">Iron ore</a> extraction took place between the 12th and 17th centuries before being replaced by <a href="lead" class="uri" title="wikilink">lead</a> mining up to the mid 18th century. The principal activity from 1720 to the closure of the last mine in 1982 was <a href="copper_extraction_techniques" title="wikilink">copper extraction</a>. <a href="Sulphur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sulphur</a> has also been extracted at certain times and, in smaller quantities, <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a>, <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a> and <a href="zinc" class="uri" title="wikilink">zinc</a>. Lead mining has been the principal activity in the Glendalough valley and its neighbouring valleys of Glendasan and Glenmalure. Lead was first discovered in Glendasan in the early 19th century and the lead veins were later followed through <a href="Camaderry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camaderry</a> mountain to Glendalough. Mining on a smaller scale took place in Glenmalure. Ore from these mines was shipped to <a href="Ballycorus_Leadmines" title="wikilink">Ballycorus</a> for processing. The last mine closed in 1957.</p>
<p><img src="Miners_Village_Glendalough.jpg" title="fig:Miners&#39; village in Glendalough" alt="Miners&#39; village in Glendalough" /> In 1795, a local schoolmaster discovered <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a> in the Aughatinavought River, a tributary of the <a href="River_Aughrim" title="wikilink">River Aughrim</a> since renamed Gold Mines River that rises on the slopes of <a href="Croghan_Mountain" title="wikilink">Croghan Kinsella</a> mountain. During the subsequent <a href="gold_rush" title="wikilink">gold rush</a>, some  of gold was recovered from the river by local prospectors, including a single nugget weighing , the largest lump of gold ever discovered in Ireland and Britain. The mine workings were subsequently seized by the British government who extracted a further  of gold. Various attempts have been made to locate the <a href="motherlode" class="uri" title="wikilink">motherlode</a> on Croghan Kinsella but to no avail.</p>
<p>Granite from the Wicklow Mountains has been used as a material for many buildings in Wicklow and Dublin and beyond. The quarries at <a href="Ballyknockan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballyknockan</a> have provided material for buildings such as the <a href="Irish_Houses_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Bank of Ireland</a> on <a href="College_Green" title="wikilink">College Green</a> in Dublin, <a href="Dun_Laoghaire" title="wikilink">Dun Laoghaire</a> lighthouse and <a href="Liverpool_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Liverpool Cathedral</a>. Similarly, quarries at <a href="Glencullen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glencullen</a> provided stone for such buildings as the <a href="General_Post_Office" title="wikilink">G. P. O.</a> on <a href="O&#39;Connell_Street" title="wikilink">O'Connell Street</a> and the Industry and Commerce building on <a href="Kildare_Street" title="wikilink">Kildare Street</a> in Dublin. Barnacullia, on the slopes of <a href="Three_Rock" title="wikilink">Three Rock</a> Mountain, supplied paving stones to <a href="Dublin_Corporation" title="wikilink">Dublin Corporation</a>. The quarry at <a href="Dalkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalkey</a> supplied granite for Dun Laoghaire Harbour and the <a href="Thames_Embankment" title="wikilink">Thames Embankment</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Powerscourt_Deerpark_and_Waterfall.jpg" title="fig:The River Dargle falls as Powerscourt Waterfall, the tallest waterfall in Ireland" alt="The River Dargle falls as Powerscourt Waterfall, the tallest waterfall in Ireland" /> The Wicklow Mountains are the source of several major <a href="drainage_system_(geomorphology)" title="wikilink">river systems</a>. Since the thin <a href="blanket_bog" title="wikilink">blanket bog</a> <a href="peat" title="wikilink">peats</a> cannot hold great quantities of water, many of these rivers exhibit a flashy <a href="hydrograph" title="wikilink">hydrography</a>, filling rapidly after heavy rain.</p>
<p>The <a href="River_Liffey" title="wikilink">River Liffey</a> rises between the mountains of <a href="Kippure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kippure</a> and Tonduff at Liffey Head Bog. One of the major <a href="tributary" title="wikilink">tributaries</a> of the Liffey, the <a href="River_Dodder" title="wikilink">River Dodder</a>, rises nearby on slopes on <a href="Kippure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kippure</a>. The King's River rises on <a href="Mullaghcleevaun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mullaghcleevaun</a> and joins the Liffey near <a href="Blessington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blessington</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="River_Vartry" title="wikilink">River Vartry</a> rises on the slopes of Djouce mountain. Nearby, the <a href="River_Dargle" title="wikilink">River Dargle</a> rises between Tonduff and War Hill, falling as the <a href="Powerscourt_Waterfall" title="wikilink">Powerscourt Waterfall</a>, Ireland's tallest waterfall at ,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> over a cliff formed by a glacier at the contact point between the granite and mica-schist of the Wicklow Mountains. The waterfalls at the heads of the valleys of Glendalough, Glenmacnass and Glendasan also occur approximately at the schist-granite junctions, as does the Carrawaystick waterfall in <a href="Glenmalure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glenmalure</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="River_Slaney" title="wikilink">River Slaney</a> rises in the North Prison of Lugnaquilla mountain and winds through the <a href="Glen_of_Imaal" title="wikilink">Glen of Imaal</a> where it is joined by the Leoh, Knickeen and Little Slaney. Another of its tributaries, the River Derreen, rises on Lugnaquilla&lt;U+2019&gt;s southern side.</p>
<p>Each of the main branches of the <a href="River_Avoca" title="wikilink">River Avoca</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the <a href="River_Avonmore" title="wikilink">Avonmore</a>, the <a href="River_Avonbeg" title="wikilink">Avonbeg</a> and the <a href="River_Aughrim" title="wikilink">Aughrim</a> rivers &lt;U+2013&gt; have their origins in smaller tributaries, many of which rise in the Wicklow Mountains. The Glenealo, Glendasan and Annamoe rivers meet to form the Avonmore near <a href="Laragh,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Laragh</a>. The Annamoe rises near Sally Gap and is joined by Cloghoge Brook between <a href="Lough_Tay" title="wikilink">Lough Tay</a> and <a href="Lough_Dan" title="wikilink">Lough Dan</a> and by the River Inchavore in Lough Dan. The Avonbeg rises on <a href="Table_Mountain,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Table Mountain</a> and the Three Lakes. The Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers join to form the River Avoca at the Meeting of the Waters in the Vale of <a href="Avoca,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Avoca</a>, celebrated in the song <em>The Meeting of the Waters</em> by <a href="Thomas_Moore" title="wikilink">Thomas Moore</a>. The Avoca is joined by the River Aughrim at Woodenbridge, sometimes referred to as the &lt;U+201C&gt;Second Meeting of the Waters&lt;U+201D&gt;. The Aughrim is formed at the junction of the Derry Water and the River Ow, the latter of which rises on Lugnaquilla. <img src="Upper_Reservoir,_Glenasmole.jpg" title="fig:The Bohernabreena Upper Reservoir in the Glenasmole valley" alt="The Bohernabreena Upper Reservoir in the Glenasmole valley" /></p>
<h3 id="reservoirs">Reservoirs</h3>

<p>Several of these rivers have been <a href="dam" title="wikilink">dammed</a> to create <a href="reservoir" title="wikilink">reservoirs</a> to provide <a href="drinking_water" title="wikilink">drinking water</a> for the residents of Dublin and its environs. The first of these was the River Vartry, dammed to create the <a href="Vartry_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Vartry Reservoir</a> near <a href="Roundwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roundwood</a> in the 1860s. A second dam was added in 1924 to increase capacity. The River Dodder feeds the two Bohernabreena reservoirs in the northern foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at Glenasmole in County Dublin, which were constructed between 1883 and 1887 to supply water to the <a href="townland" class="uri" title="wikilink">townland</a> of <a href="Rathmines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rathmines</a>. The <a href="Poulaphouca_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Poulaphouca Reservoir</a>, on the River Liffey near Blessington, was constructed between 1938 and 1940. There are also two <a href="hydroelectricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroelectricity</a> plants at Poulaphouca, constructed during the 1940s. A <a href="pumped_storage_hydroelectricity" title="wikilink">pumped storage hydroelectricity</a> plant was constructed at <a href="Turlough_Hill" title="wikilink">Turlough Hill</a> between 1968 and 1974.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Water is pumped up from Lough Nanahangan, a natural corrie lake, into an artificial reservoir on Tomaneena mountain and released at times of peak electricity demand.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

The mountain <a href="blanket_bog" title="wikilink">blanket bogs</a> formed around 4,000 years ago as a result of a combination of <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a> and human activity. Prior to this, the mountains were cloaked with <a href="temperate_coniferous_forest" title="wikilink">pine forest</a>.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><img src="Glendalough_alt.jpg" title="fig:The monastic city at Glendalough" alt="The monastic city at Glendalough" /> The earliest evidence of human activity in the interior of Wicklow dates to around 4,300 BCE. <a href="Passage_tomb" title="wikilink">Passage tombs</a>, from the <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> period, are the earliest and most prominent feature of prehistoric Irish civilisation in the Wicklow Mountains. These tombs sit on many of the western and northern summits between <a href="Saggart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saggart</a> in Dublin and <a href="Baltinglass" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baltinglass</a> in Wicklow, such as at <a href="Seefin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seefin</a> and <a href="Seefingan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seefingan</a>. Archaeologist Geraldine Stout has suggested they had a territorial marking function, much like modern-day border posts. Other prehistoric monuments to be found in the uplands include <a href="stone_circle" title="wikilink">stone circles</a>, <a href="standing_stones" title="wikilink">standing stones</a> and <a href="rock_art" title="wikilink">rock art</a>. The presence of standing stones at altitudes suggests they may have served route-marking purposes. The largest complex of <a href="hill_fort" title="wikilink">hill forts</a> in Ireland is to be found on the hills near Baltinglass.</p>
<p>The earliest known tribes to have controlled the Wicklow Mountains include the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Messin Corb, the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; Mail, the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; Theig and the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; Bri&lt;U+00FA&gt;in. One member of the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Messin Corb was <a href="Kevin_of_Glendalough" title="wikilink">Saint Kevin</a>, who founded the <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> at <a href="Glendalough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glendalough</a> in the latter part of the 6th century. Kevin travelled to Glendalough from <a href="Hollywood,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>, crossing the mountains via the Wicklow Gap. By the 8th century, Glendalough had grown into a substantial settlement of 500-1,000 people and an important site of learning and <a href="pilgrimage" class="uri" title="wikilink">pilgrimage</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Monasteries were often attacked, especially at times of disease or famine, and Glendalough's wealth made it a frequent target for both local tribes and, later, <a href="Norsemen" title="wikilink">Norse</a> invaders. The monastery declined in importance after the arrival of the <a href="Normans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normans</a> in the 12th century and its subsequent annexation to the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Dublin" title="wikilink">Archdiocese of Dublin</a>. It was burned by the English in 1398, although settlement there continued until the end of the 16th century. There are also important early Irish church sites in the Dublin foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at <a href="Carrickgollogan#Rathmichael_old_church_and_round_tower" title="wikilink">Rathmichael</a> and Tully.</p>
<p>In 1170, during the <a href="Norman_invasion_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Norman invasion of Ireland</a>, <a href="Richard_de_Clare,_2nd_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">Strongbow</a> and <a href="Dermot_MacMurrough" title="wikilink">Dermot MacMurrough</a> successfully laid siege to Dublin by following a high route through the Wicklow Mountains, avoiding the defences along the normal route to the west of the mountains. The Norman invasion displaced two important <a href="Gaels" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> <a href="clan" title="wikilink">clans</a> from <a href="County_Kildare" title="wikilink">Kildare</a>, the <a href="O&#39;Byrne_family" title="wikilink">O'Byrnes</a> and the <a href="O&#39;Toole_family" title="wikilink">O'Tooles</a>, who moved into the Wicklow Mountains, the O'Byrnes in the east and the O'Tooles in the west. From their mountain strongholds both families conducted a persistent campaign of harassment against the invaders and the Wicklow Mountains became known as the <em>terra guerre</em> (&lt;U+201C&gt;land of war&lt;U+201D&gt;), as opposed to the <em>terra pacis</em> (&lt;U+201C&gt;land of peace&lt;U+201D&gt;) of the settled lowlands.</p>
<p>The valley of <a href="Glenmalure" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glenmalure</a> provided an almost unassailable refuge for the clans and English forces suffered heavy defeats there, first in 1274 and again in 1580 in the <a href="Battle_of_Glenmalure" title="wikilink">Battle of Glenmalure</a>. The latter defeat was at the hands of <a href="Fiach_McHugh_O&#39;Byrne" title="wikilink">Fiach McHugh O'Byrne</a>, who led many attacks against the English and assisted in the escapes of many of the hostages held by the English to guarantee the loyalty of the Irish clans. One such hostage was <a href="Hugh_Roe_O&#39;Donnell" title="wikilink">Red Hugh O'Donnell</a>, who escaped from <a href="Dublin_Castle" title="wikilink">Dublin Castle</a> on the night of 6 January 1592 in the company of Art O'Neill. The two men crossed the mountains in blizzard conditions, making for Fiach McHugh O'Byrne's stronghold at Glenmalure. Art O'Neill died from <a href="hypothermia" title="wikilink">exposure</a> during the journey and Red Hugh had several toes amputated due to <a href="frostbite" class="uri" title="wikilink">frostbite</a>. A cross and a plaque to the north of <a href="Conavalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conavalla</a> mountain mark the place where Art O'Neill perished and an annual walk is now held following in the two men's footsteps.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The O'Byrnes' and O'Tooles' dominance finally came to an end with the <a href="Act_for_the_Settlement_of_Ireland_1652" title="wikilink">Act of Succession</a> of 1652 when their land was confiscated by the <a href="English_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">English Commonwealth</a>.</p>
<p>A prolonged period of peace reigned in the Wicklow Mountains from the end of the <a href="Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Cromwellian period</a> until the <a href="Irish_rebellion_of_1798" title="wikilink">1798 Rising</a>. Although the main rebellion was quickly defeated, Irish rebels once again used the Wicklow Mountains as a hiding place and stronghold to attack the English for many years afterwards. Among their number was <a href="Michael_Dwyer" title="wikilink">Michael Dwyer</a>, a native of the Wicklow Mountains, born in the <a href="townland" class="uri" title="wikilink">townland</a> of Camara in the <a href="Glen_of_Imaal" title="wikilink">Glen of Imaal</a>, and <a href="Joseph_Holt_(rebel)" title="wikilink">General Joseph Holt</a>. Both men eventually surrendered and were <a href="penal_transportation" title="wikilink">transported</a> to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. Determined to prevent any future rebel activity, a military road through the mountains, similar to those built in the <a href="Scottish_Highlands" title="wikilink">Scottish Highlands</a> to quell the <a href="Jacobite_risings" title="wikilink">Jacobite risings</a>, was proposed by the British government to enable troops to be deployed quickly into the region. The <a href="R115_road" title="wikilink">Wicklow Military Road</a> was constructed between 1800 and 1809 and runs from <a href="Rathfarnham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rathfarnham</a>, County Dublin to <a href="Aghavannagh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aghavannagh</a>, County Wicklow via <a href="Glencree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glencree</a>, the Sally Gap and <a href="Laragh,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Laragh</a>. A series of army barracks and police stations were built along the route, although they were little used and soon fell into disrepair as the Wicklow Mountains soon ceased to be a centre of rebel activity after the road was completed.</p>
<p>The <a href="census" class="uri" title="wikilink">census</a> of 1841 recorded a population of 13,000 in the Wicklow uplands out of 126,143 persons in the county as a whole. Following the <a href="Great_Famine_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Great Famine</a>, the census of 1891 showed the population of County Wicklow had declined to 62,136 with the proportionate fall in the uplands regions even greater as the populace deserted the marginal lands.</p>
<p>The <a href="history_of_rail_transport_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">construction of the railways</a> in the 19th century led to the development of <a href="tourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourism</a> in the Wicklow Mountains. Visitors were taken by horse-drawn transport into the mountains from the railway station at <a href="Rathdrum,_County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">Rathdrum</a>. Glendalough quickly established itself as the most popular tourist destination and a train service there was considered in 1897 but the proposals came to nothing. The tourism potential of the Military Road was spotted soon after its completion and G. N. Wright's <em>Tours in Ireland</em> (1822) is one of the earliest guides to the sights along the route.</p>

<p><img src="Wicklow_Mountains_National_Park_Information_Office.jpg" title="fig:The Wicklow Mountains National Park information office in Glendalough" alt="The Wicklow Mountains National Park information office in Glendalough" /> The principal farming activity in the uplands is sheep <a href="grazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">grazing</a>, using mainly the Wicklow <a href="Cheviot_sheep" title="wikilink">Cheviot</a> breed. Land is also used for <a href="forestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">forestry</a> and <a href="turbary" title="wikilink">turf cutting</a>. Tourism and recreation are also major activities in the uplands. Glendalough remains the most popular destination, receiving around one million visitors each year. Recreational activities in the mountains include walking, <a href="rock_climbing" title="wikilink">rock climbing</a>, <a href="fishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishing</a> and <a href="cycling" class="uri" title="wikilink">cycling</a>. <a href="Hillwalking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hillwalking</a> in the Wicklow Mountains was first popularised by <a href="J._B._Malone" title="wikilink">J. B. Malone</a> through a weekly column he wrote in the <em><a href="Evening_Herald" title="wikilink">Evening Herald</a></em> newspaper. Malone was later instrumental in the creation of the <a href="Wicklow_Way" title="wikilink">Wicklow Way</a>, Ireland's first <a href="long-distance_trails_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">National Waymarked Trail</a>, which opened in 1980 and crosses the Wicklow Mountains.

<p>On foot of concerns about environmental degradation and undesirable development of the Wicklow Uplands, the Government announced the creation of the <a href="Wicklow_Mountains_National_Park" title="wikilink">Wicklow Mountains National Park</a> in 1990 to conserve the area's biodiversity and landscape.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The park was officially established in 1991 and now encompasses an area of over .<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In addition, the Wicklow Mountains (including areas outside the National Park) are classed as a <a href="Special_Area_of_Conservation" title="wikilink">Special Area of Conservation</a> under the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">EU</a> <a href="Habitats_Directive" title="wikilink">Habitats Directive</a> and as a <a href="Special_Protection_Area" title="wikilink">Special Protection Area</a> under the EU <a href="Birds_Directive" title="wikilink">Birds Directive</a>.</p>
