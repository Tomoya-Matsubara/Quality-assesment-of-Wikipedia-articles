<p>The <strong>County Borough of Leeds</strong> and the preceeding <strong>Municipal Borough of Leeds</strong> was a local government district in the <a href="West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Riding</a> of <a href="Yorkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>, England, from 1835 to 1974.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It originated from the ancient borough of <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a>, which was reformed by the <a href="Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835" title="wikilink">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a>. In 1889, when <a href="West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Riding County Council</a> was formed, Leeds became a <a href="County_Borough" title="wikilink">County Borough</a> outside the administrative county of the West Riding; and in 1893 the borough gained <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">city status</a>. The borough was extended a number of times, expanding from  in 1911 to  in 1961; adding in stages the former area of Roundhay, Seacroft, Shadwell and Middleton parishes and gaining other parts of adjacent districts. In 1971 Leeds was the fifth largest <a href="List_of_administrative_counties_and_county_boroughs_of_England_by_population_in_1971" title="wikilink">county borough by population</a> in England. The county borough was abolished in 1974 and replaced with the larger <a href="City_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">City of Leeds</a>, a <a href="metropolitan_borough" title="wikilink">metropolitan district</a> of <a href="West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Yorkshire</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="Borough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borough</a> of <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> was created in 1207, when Maurice Paynel, <a href="Lord_of_the_Manor" title="wikilink">Lord of the Manor</a>, granted a <a href="charter" class="uri" title="wikilink">charter</a> to the inhabitants of the town of Leeds. They were created &quot;<a href="Burgess_(title)" title="wikilink">burgesses</a>&quot;, and were given the right to hold half an <a href="acre" class="uri" title="wikilink">acre</a> of land, trade as they liked, and transport their goods by land or water, subject to <a href="Tariff" title="wikilink">tolls</a> and restrictions paid to the manor. The only officer of the borough was a <a href="praetor" class="uri" title="wikilink">praetor</a>, appointed annually at the <a href="Feast_of_Pentecost" title="wikilink">Feast of Pentecost</a> by the Lord of the Borough. The praetor had the duty of administering justice and collecting fines and other revenues.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The borough formed only a small area adjacent to a crossing of the <a href="River_Aire" title="wikilink">River Aire</a>, between the old settlement centred on <a href="Leeds_Parish_Church" title="wikilink">Leeds Parish Church</a> to the east and the manor house and mills to the west.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The borough consisted of a single street with approximately thirty <a href="burgage_plot" title="wikilink">burgage plots</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the seventeenth century the title of praetor had been abandoned in favour of the more customary &quot;<a href="bailiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">bailiff</a>&quot;, but otherwise the government of the town remained in the form introduced in the thirteenth century. An enquiry into the administration of local charities in 1620 disclosed that many of the funds were diverted by the bailiff for his private use. This, and other irregularities, led the inhabitants of Leeds to petition <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a> for a <a href="royal_charter" title="wikilink">charter of incorporation</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="incorporation">Incorporation</h4>
<p>A charter of incorporation was granted on 13 July 1626, incorporating the entire parish of Leeds St Peter as the &quot;Borough of Leedes in the County of York&quot;. The parish and borough consisted of eleven chapelries (<a href="Armley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armley</a>, <a href="Beeston,_Leeds" title="wikilink">Beeston</a>, <a href="Beeston,_Leeds" title="wikilink">Bramley</a>, <a href="Chapel_Allerton" title="wikilink">Chapel Allerton</a>, <a href="Farnley,_West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Farnley</a>, <a href="Headingley_cum_Burley" title="wikilink">Headingley cum Burley</a>, <a href="Holbeck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holbeck</a>, <a href="Hunslet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hunslet</a>, <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a>, <a href="Potternewton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Potternewton</a> and <a href="Wortley,_West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Wortley</a>) and parts of two more (<a href="Seacroft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seacroft</a> and <a href="Temple_Newsam" title="wikilink">Temple Newsam</a>).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The governing corporation of the borough was styled &quot;The Alderman and Burgesses of the Borough of Leedes in the County of York&quot;, and consisted of one <a href="Alderman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alderman</a>, nine principal burgesses and twenty assistants.

<p>In January 1643, during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, Leeds fell to <a href="New_Model_Army" title="wikilink">parliamentary forces</a>. Royalist members of the corporation were replaced with those loyal to the Commonwealth. With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, moves were made to reform the borough's government. The leading merchants of the town submitted a petition to <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a> requesting a new charter as they felt the constitution and operation of the governing body was inadequate to the needs of the town.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>A second charter was duly granted on 2 November 1661, with the earlier charter withdrawn.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The new corporation thus created consisted of a <a href="mayor" class="uri" title="wikilink">mayor</a>, twelve <a href="alderman" title="wikilink">aldermen</a>, twenty four assistants, a <a href="recorder_(judge)" title="wikilink">recorder</a> and a <a href="town_clerk" title="wikilink">town clerk</a> and was entitled the &quot;Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Leedes in the County of York&quot;.

With the accession of <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William III</a> and <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary II</a> the 1661 charter was restored to the townspeople, and remained the governing charter until 1836.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1833 the <a href="Whig_(British_political_faction)" title="wikilink">Whig</a> Government of <a href="Charles_Grey,_2nd_Earl_Grey" title="wikilink">Lord Grey</a> began enquiries into the government of the various boroughs in England and Wales, with a view to reforming their constitutions and methods of election.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Following the recommendations of a <a href="Royal_Commission" title="wikilink">Royal Commission</a>, legislation was enacted as the <a href="Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835" title="wikilink">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a>.</p>
<p>Leeds was among the 178 boroughs reformed by the act, becoming the &quot;Municipal Borough of Leeds&quot;. The reformed borough was initially unchanged in area, and was divided into 12 <a href="ward_(politics)" title="wikilink">wards</a>, with a town council of 16 aldermen and 48 councillors, headed by a mayor.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Each ward was represented by either three or six directly elected councillors. One third of the councillors retired annually. Aldermen were additional members of the council, there being one alderman for every three councillors: they had a six-year term of office, with half of the aldermanic bench elected by the council itself every three years. <img src="Leeds_1866_by_J_Bartholemew_edited.jpg" title="fig:An 1866 map of Leeds" alt="An 1866 map of Leeds" width="250" /></p>

<p>It was originally envisaged that the first elections would be held on 1 November 1835, with the reformed town councils holding their first meetings on 9 November following. However, the process of dividing the boroughs into wards and preparing the burgess roll or <a href="electoral_register" title="wikilink">electoral register</a> was a lengthy one, and an <a href="Order_in_Council" title="wikilink">Order in Council</a> was made delaying the first elections to 26 December, with the new boroughs coming into formal existence on 1 January 1836.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1881 the wards were redrawn, so that the borough comprised sixteen wards. The size of the town council remained the same, however, with each new ward returning one alderman and three councillors.</p>

<p>The <a href="Local_Government_Act_1888" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1888</a> created elected <a href="county_council" title="wikilink">county councils</a> to administer services throughout England and Wales. Where a municipal borough had a population of more than 50,000 at the 1881 <a href="Census_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Census</a> it was created a <a href="county_borough" title="wikilink">county borough</a>, with the powers and duties of both a borough and county council.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>As Leeds had an 1881 population of 309,119 it duly became a county borough on 1 April 1889. The borough, while independent of the West Riding County Council for local government, remained part of the county for purposes such as the administration of justice and <a href="lord_lieutenant" title="wikilink">lieutenancy</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The change of status in 1889 made no change to the boundaries of the borough or the size of the council.</p>
<h3 id="city-status-and-lord-mayoralty">City status and lord mayoralty</h3>
<p>Until 1889 the right to the <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">title of &quot;city&quot;</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> was linked to the presence of an <a href="Anglican_Communion" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> <a href="cathedral" class="uri" title="wikilink">cathedral</a>. In that year Birmingham, Dundee and Belfast were granted <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">letters patent</a> raising them to cities by virtue of their population, economic importance and history of good municipal government.</p>
<p>In 1892 another borough in the West Riding, Sheffield, announced that it was seeking the grant of city status to celebrate the <a href="Golden_Jubilee" title="wikilink">Golden Jubilee</a> of the town's incorporation, which was to occur in 1893. When Leeds Town Council became aware of the application by Sheffield, which was both smaller in population and of more recent creation than Leeds, they immediately began the process of applying for the dignity themselves. A petition was approved on 4 January 1893, which set out the reasons it was felt that Leeds deserved to become a city: these were the antiquity of the town, its many charters, its large area, its population that was &quot;approaching 400,000&quot;, the fact that it was the largest municipality not to be a city, and its commercial importance for the woollen industry.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>A delegation from Leeds, including two <a href="member_of_parliament" title="wikilink">Members of Parliament</a> (MPs), met with the <a href="Home_Secretary" title="wikilink">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="H_H_Asquith" title="wikilink">H H Asquith</a> on 27 January to press the borough's case. Along with the claims of the borough as set out in the original petition, the delegation made two more points: Leeds was the only university town not a city, and Leeds and Sheffield were the only boroughs returning five MPs to the House of Commons without the status (of a city).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The Home Secretary forwarded the petitions of both boroughs to the <a href="Queen_Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen</a> on 3 February, recommending that the honour be granted in both cases as they were the <em>&quot;only towns in the United Kingdom with a population exceeding 300,000 to which the title of City, enjoyed by many smaller of less important places, has not been granted; and that both appear to be well fitted by their loyalty, public spirit, and industrial progress, for this mark of your Majesty's favour.&quot;</em><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On 7 February, Sir Godfrey Lushington, permanent secretary to the <a href="Home_Office" title="wikilink">Home Office</a>, wrote to the mayors of both towns signifying that the applications had been approved.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The award was made by letters patent on 13 February, and was announced in the <em><a href="London_Gazette" title="wikilink">London Gazette</a></em> on 21 February:</p>

<p>In 1919 the city council sought another extension, this time to the south, by taking in the parish of <a href="Middleton,_Leeds" title="wikilink">Middleton</a> from <a href="Hunslet_Rural_District" title="wikilink">Hunslet Rural District</a>. The boundary change took effect on 1 April 1920, and Middleton formed a 17th ward, electing 3 councillors and 1 alderman to the city council, which was increased in size accordingly. The parish of Middleton was abolished, with its area added to the existing parish of Hunslet.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The extra territory was acquired by the county borough for a major scheme of <a href="council_house" title="wikilink">council housing</a>, the construction of which commenced almost immediately.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> On 1 April 1925 the five parishes in the county borough were united into a single parish of Leeds.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1927 Leeds Corporation promoted a bill to add further areas to the city, namely <a href="Gildersome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gildersome</a> Urban District, and parts of the <a href="rural_district" title="wikilink">rural districts</a> of Hunslet, Tadcaster and <a href="Wharfedale_Rural_District" title="wikilink">Wharfedale</a> (the parishes of <a href="Adel_cum_Eccup" title="wikilink">Adel cum Eccup</a>, <a href="Alwoodley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alwoodley</a>, Austhorpe - except for a detached part - and Templenewsham).<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Leeds Corporation Act 1927, as passed, omitted Gildersome and most of Austhorpe from the area added to Leeds. The extension, which took effect on 1 April 1928 added approximately  to the county borough. The area added comprised the parishes of Adel cum Eccup and Alwoodley to the north, and Templenewsham with  from the parish of Austhorpe to the east.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1930 the wards of the county borough were redrawn, necessitating a <a href="general_election" title="wikilink">general election</a> of the entire city council. Twenty-six wards were created, each returning 3 councillors and 1 alderman. The membership of the council was increased from 68 (51 councillors and 17 aldermen) to 104 (78 councillors and 26 aldermen).<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The twenty-six wards were as follows:</p>

<p>On 1 April 1937 the boundary of the county borough with the surrounding areas of the West Riding was adjusted under a <a href="Local_Government_Act_1929" title="wikilink">county review order</a>.

<p>In 1950 the city council petitioned for an alteration in the number and boundaries of the municipal wards, and a consequent change in the number of aldermen and councillors. The petition was successful, with an <a href="order_in_council" title="wikilink">order in council</a> made on 28 July dividing the city into twenty-eight wards:<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>The redrawing of wards made a general election of the entire council necessary in May 1951. The new council had a membership of 112: 84 councillors and 28 aldermen.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> a <a href="Local_Government_Boundary_Commission_(1945&lt;U+2013&gt;1949)" title="wikilink">Local Government Boundary Commission</a> was appointed to review administrative structures throughout England and Wales. While the commission was in existence, local authorities were not permitted to make unilateral proposals for boundary changes. Although the commission recommended that Leeds should form the basis of a new unitary &quot;one tier county&quot; no action was taken.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The commission itself was wound up in 1949, and the final enlargement of the county borough took place under the Leeds Corporation Act 1956, on 1 April 1957.  of Tadcaster Rural District were added to the city.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>From the late nineteen fifties the structure of local government was subject to a number of proposed reforms, although actual change did not place until 1974. A second <a href="Local_Government_Commission_for_England_(1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1967)" title="wikilink">Local Government Commission for England</a> was created <a href="Local_Government_Act_1958" title="wikilink">in 1958</a> to devise proposals for &quot;effective and convenient&quot; local authority areas. Leeds and its surrounding conurbation were designated as the &quot;West Yorkshire Special Review Area&quot;. When the commission reported on the Review Area in 1962, only a small boundary change was proposed.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The 1958 commission was disbanded in 1966, and the <a href="Redcliffe-Maud_Report" title="wikilink">Redcliffe-Maud Commission</a> appointed in its place. When their report was published in 1969, they recommended a system of large <a href="unitary_authority" title="wikilink">unitary authorities</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> A new Leeds authority was proposed, with an area of  and a population of 840,000. The boundaries would have included a large rural area including part of the <a href="Yorkshire_Dales" title="wikilink">Yorkshire Dales</a> and the town of <a href="Harrogate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harrogate</a>. The proposal was welcomed by Leeds City Council.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Following a change of government, a <a href="white_paper" title="wikilink">white paper</a> issued in 1971 rejected the unitary structure and instead proposed a <a href="metropolitan_county" title="wikilink">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Yorkshire</a>, with Leeds forming a district in a two-tier system.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> During the passing of the subsequent legislation, which was enacted as the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1972" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the boundaries of the Leeds Metropolitan District (or District 6b) were altered. <a href="Knaresborough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knaresborough</a> and Harrogate were removed (becoming the basis of a <a href="non-metropolitan_district" title="wikilink">non-metropolitan district</a> in <a href="North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Yorkshire</a>) while <a href="Rothwell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rothwell</a> was added from the neighbouring Wakefield district.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="metropolitan-borough">Metropolitan borough</h3>
<p>The 1972 legislation came into effect on 1 April 1974, with the county borough ceasing to exist at midnight on 31 March. The county borough's area was combined with that of the <a href="Municipal_Borough_of_Morley" title="wikilink">Municipal Borough of Morley</a>, the <a href="Municipal_Borough_of_Pudsey" title="wikilink">Municipal Borough of Pudsey</a>, <a href="Aireborough_Urban_District" title="wikilink">Aireborough Urban District</a>, <a href="Horsforth_Urban_District" title="wikilink">Horsforth Urban District</a>, <a href="Otley_Urban_District" title="wikilink">Otley Urban District</a>, <a href="Garforth_Urban_District" title="wikilink">Garforth Urban District</a>, <a href="Rothwell_Urban_District" title="wikilink">Rothwell Urban District</a> and parts of Tadcaster Rural District, Wetherby Rural District and Wharfedale Rural District from the West Riding. The new Leeds district was one of five metropolitan districts in West Yorkshire. It was granted a <a href="borough_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">borough</a> and <a href="city_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">city status</a> to become the <a href="City_of_Leeds" title="wikilink">City of Leeds</a>.</p>
