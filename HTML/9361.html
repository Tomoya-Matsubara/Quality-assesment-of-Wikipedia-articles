<p><strong>Edward II</strong> (25 April 1284Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 21 September 1327), also called <strong>Edward of Caernarfon</strong>, was <a href="List_of_English_monarchs" title="wikilink">King of England</a> from 1307 until he was <a href="deposition_(politics)" title="wikilink">deposed</a> in January 1327. The fourth son of <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a>, Edward became the heir to the throne following the death of his older brother <a href="Alphonso,_Earl_of_Chester" title="wikilink">Alfonso</a>. He grew up to be tall, athletic and was considered good-looking by his contemporaries. From 1300 onward, Edward accompanied his father on his <a href="Wars_of_Scottish_Independence" title="wikilink">campaigns to pacify Scotland</a>, and in 1307 he was knighted in a <a href="Feast_of_the_Swans" title="wikilink">grand ceremony</a> at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>. Edward succeeded to the throne later that year, following his father's death. In 1308, he married <a href="Isabella_of_France" title="wikilink">Isabella of France</a>, the daughter of the powerful <a href="Philip_IV_of_France" title="wikilink">King Philip IV</a>, as part of a long-running effort to resolve the tensions between the English and French crowns.</p>
<p>Edward had a very close relationship with <a href="Piers_Gaveston" title="wikilink">Piers Gaveston</a>, who had first joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of Edward and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, <a href="gay" title="wikilink">lovers</a> or <a href="blood_brother" title="wikilink">sworn brothers</a>. Gaveston's position as Edward's <a href="favourite" class="uri" title="wikilink">favourite</a> provoked discontent both among the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to <a href="exile" class="uri" title="wikilink">exile</a> him. On Gaveston's return, the King was pressured into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms called the <a href="Ordinances_of_1311" title="wikilink">Ordinances of 1311</a>. Gaveston was banished by the barons, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the <a href="Thomas,_2nd_Earl_of_Lancaster" title="wikilink">Earl of Lancaster</a>, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confronation. England was pushed back onto the defensive in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by <a href="Robert_the_Bruce" title="wikilink">Robert the Bruce</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Bannockburn" title="wikilink">Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314. <a href="Great_Famine_of_1315&lt;U+2013&gt;17" title="wikilink">Widespread famine</a> followed, and criticism of the King mounted.</p>
<p>The Despenser family, in particular <a href="Hugh_Despenser_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, became close friends and advisers to Edward, but in 1321 Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a <a href="Despenser_War" title="wikilink">short military campaign</a>, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Isabella allied herself with the exiled <a href="Roger_Mortimer,_1st_Earl_of_March" title="wikilink">Roger Mortimer</a>, and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled into Wales, where he was captured in November. Edward was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his son, <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III</a>, and he died in <a href="Berkeley_Castle" title="wikilink">Berkeley Castle</a> on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.</p>
<p>Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired <a href="Christopher_Marlowe" title="wikilink">Christopher Marlowe</a>'s 1592 play <em><a href="Edward_II_(play)" title="wikilink">Edward II</a></em>, along with other plays, films, novels and media. Many of these have focused on the possible homosexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries were highly critical of his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics argued that the growth of <a href="Parliament_of_England" title="wikilink">parliamentary institutions</a> during his reign were a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Edward II was the fourth son of <a href="Edward_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward I</a> and his first wife, <a href="Eleanor_of_Castile" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Castile</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His father was the <a href="King_of_England" title="wikilink">King of England</a>, and had also inherited <a href="Gascony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gascony</a> in south-western France, which he held as the <a href="feudal" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudal</a> vassal of the <a href="King_of_France" title="wikilink">King of France</a>, and the <a href="Lordship_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lordship of Ireland</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His mother was from the <a href="Kingdom_of_Castile" title="wikilink">Castilian</a> royal family, and held the <a href="County_of_Ponthieu" title="wikilink">County of Ponthieu</a> in northern France. Edward I proved to be a successful military leader, leading the <a href="Second_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">suppression of the baronial revolts</a> in the 1260s, and joining the <a href="Ninth_Crusade" title="wikilink">Ninth Crusade</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> During the 1280s he <a href="Conquest_of_Wales_by_Edward_I" title="wikilink">conquered North Wales</a>, removing the <a href="Welsh_people" title="wikilink">native Welsh</a> princes from power, and in the 1290s he <a href="Wars_of_Scottish_independence" title="wikilink">intervened in Scotland's civil war</a>, claiming <a href="suzerainty" class="uri" title="wikilink">suzerainty</a> over the country.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He was a considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful <a href="earl" title="wikilink">earls</a> that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The historian <a href="Michael_Prestwich" title="wikilink">Michael Prestwich</a> describes Edward I as &quot;a king to inspire fear and respect&quot;, while <a href="John_Gillingham" title="wikilink">John Gillingham</a> characterises him as an efficient bully.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>During this time, Edward became close to <a href="Piers_Gaveston" title="wikilink">Piers Gaveston</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Gaveston was the son of one of the King's household knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and joined Prince Edward's household in 1300, possibly on Edward I's instruction.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The two got on well, and Gaveston became a <a href="squire" class="uri" title="wikilink">squire</a>, was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the King during the Feast of Swans in 1306.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Gaveston was then exiled to Gascony by the King in 1307, for reasons that remain unclear.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the King responded furiously, pulling his son's hair out in great handfuls, before then permanently exiling Gaveston.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince in some way.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>The possibility that Edward had a <a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|John Boswell puts forward one of the most prominent arguments in favour of Edward and Gaveston having been homosexual lovers. Jeffrey Hamilton supports that the relationship was sexual, but that it was probably not overtly so. The historian Michael Prestwich is sympathetic to the argument that Edward and Gaveston had entered into a bond of adoptive brotherhood, but with a &quot;sexual element&quot; to both this and Edward's relationship with Despenser; Roy Haines echoes Prestwich's judgements; Miri Rubin argues in favour of their being friends, with a &quot;very intense working relationship&quot;; Seymour Phillips believes it most likely that Edward regarded Gaveston as his adoptive brother.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, who equated it with <a href="heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">heresy</a>, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity in the same way that it might do in the 21st century.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Indeed, Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, <a href="Eleanor_de_Clare" title="wikilink">Eleanor de Clare</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The contemporary evidence for a homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s, who described how Edward &quot;felt such love&quot; for Gaveston that &quot;he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The first specific suggestion that Edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334, when <a href="Adam_Orleton" title="wikilink">Adam Orleton</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Winchester</a>, was accused of having stated in 1326 that Edward was a &quot;sodomite&quot;, although Orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that Edward's advisor, <a href="Hugh_Despenser_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Hugh Despenser the Younger</a>, was a sodomite, rather than the late King.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The Meaux Chronicle from the 1390s similarly notes that Edward gave himself &quot;too much to the vice of sodomy.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends, with a close working relationship.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Contemporary <a href="chronicler" class="uri" title="wikilink">chronicler</a> comments are vaguely worded, Orleton's allegations were at least in part politically motivated, and closely resemble the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope <a href="Boniface_VIII" title="wikilink">Boniface VIII</a> and the <a href="Knights_Templar" title="wikilink">Knights Templar</a> in 1303 and 1308 respectively.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Later chronicler accounts of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Historians such as <a href="Michael_Prestwich" title="wikilink">Michael Prestwich</a> and <a href="J._R._S._Phillips" title="wikilink">Seymour Phillips</a> argue that the very public nature of the English royal court would have it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet, and that observe that neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>A more recent theory is that Edward and Gaveston entered into a bond of <a href="blood_brother" title="wikilink">adoptive brotherhood</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Compacts of adoptive brotherhood, in which the participants pledged to support each other in a form of &quot;brotherhood-in-arms&quot;, were not unknown between close male friends in the Middle Ages.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Many chroniclers described Edward and Gaveston's relationship as one of brotherhood, and one explicitly noted that Edward had taken Gaveston as his adopted brother.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The historian Pierre Chaplais argues that the pair may have made a formal compact in either 1300 or 1301, and that they would have seen any later promises they made to separate or to leave each other as having been made under duress, and therefore invalid.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Such a compact, however, might not have excluded their relationship from having a sexual dimension as well.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grand-father, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's laywers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been divided up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an <a href="allod" class="uri" title="wikilink">allod</a>, Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French King's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>

<p>Another set of controversial theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the &quot;<a href="Fieschi_Letter" title="wikilink">Fieschi Letter</a>&quot;, sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant, and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Empire</a>.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward's corpse to avoid punishment.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> The letter is often linked to an account of Edward III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in <a href="Antwerp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antwerp</a> in 1338, who claimed to be Edward II.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a></p>

<p>Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he &quot;was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues&quot;, echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as &quot;incompetent and vicious&quot;, and as &quot;no man of business&quot;.<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a> Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he &quot;was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one&quot;, preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a> Edward's willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees.<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"><sup>371</sup></a> Edward could take a keen interest in the minutiae of administration, however, and on occasion engaged in the details of a wide range of issues across England and his wider domains.<a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372"><sup>372</sup></a></p>
<p>One of Edward's persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around &lt;U+00A3&gt;60,000 was still owing in the 1320s.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373"><sup>373</sup></a> The King worked his way through a large number of treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, and exploited often unpopular tax revenues, prises and taking out loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374"><sup>374</sup></a> Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly, while cutting back on the expenses of his own household.<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375"><sup>375</sup></a></p>
<p>Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376"><sup>376</sup></a> It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322.<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377"><sup>377</sup></a> Edward made extensive use of <a href="Civil_law_(Roman)" title="wikilink">Roman civil law</a> during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning older principles of the <a href="English_Common_Law" title="wikilink">English Common Law</a>.<a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378"><sup>378</sup></a> Edward was also criticised from contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although how just widely they did so is unclear.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379"><sup>379</sup></a> Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local <a href="gentry" class="uri" title="wikilink">gentry</a>; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"><sup>380</sup></a></p>
<p>Parliament grew in importance under Edward as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were &quot;still as much an event as an institution&quot;.<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"><sup>381</sup></a> After 1311, parliament began to include both the barons, and the representatives of the <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knights</a> and <a href="burgess_(title)" title="wikilink">burgesses</a>: the latter grouping would in later years be termed the &quot;<a href="House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">commons</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382"><sup>382</sup></a> Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use parliaments as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"><sup>383</sup></a> After resisting it for many years, Edward intervened increasing in Parliament in the second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims.<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384"><sup>384</sup></a> It remains unclear, however, whether Edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"><sup>385</sup></a></p>

<p>Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of the <a href="Jean_Louis_de_Nogaret_de_La_Valette" title="wikilink">Duc d'&lt;U+00C9&gt;pernon</a> and <a href="Henry_III_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry III of France</a>, and between the <a href="George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham" title="wikilink">Duke of Buckingham</a> and <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"><sup>412</sup></a> In the first half of the 19th century, popular historians such as <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="Charles_Knight_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Charles Knight</a> popularised Edward's life with the <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian public</a>, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values, and by the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a> Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a></p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as <a href="William_Stubbs" title="wikilink">William Stubbs</a>, <a href="Thomas_Frederick_Tout" title="wikilink">Thomas Tout</a> and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a> Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a> During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century.<a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418"><sup>418</sup></a> The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, <a href="John_Maddicott" title="wikilink">John Maddicott</a> and Seymour Phillips, re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts.<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a> With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's younger life, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, however, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.<a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420"><sup>420</sup></a></p>

<p>Several plays have shaped Edward's contemporary image.<a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"><sup>421</sup></a> <a href="Christopher_Marlowe" title="wikilink">Christopher Marlowe</a>'s play <em><a href="Edward_II_(play)" title="wikilink">Edward II</a></em> was first performed around 1592, and focuses on Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites.<a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref422"><sup>422</sup></a> Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker.<a href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423"><sup>423</sup></a> The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries <a href="James_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James I of Scotland</a> and Henry III of France, may have influenced <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>'s portrayal of <a href="Richard_II_(play)" title="wikilink">Richard II</a>.<a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424"><sup>424</sup></a> In the 17th century, the playwright <a href="Ben_Jonson" title="wikilink">Ben Jonson</a> picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, <em>Mortimer His Fall</em>.<a href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425"><sup>425</sup></a></p>
<p>The filmmaker <a href="Derek_Jarman" title="wikilink">Derek Jarman</a> adapted the Marlowe play into a <a href="Edward_II_(film)" title="wikilink">film</a> in 1992, creating a <a href="postmodern" class="uri" title="wikilink">postmodern</a> <a href="pastiche" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastiche</a> of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies.<a href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref426"><sup>426</sup></a> In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the tradition in the Fieschi letter.<a href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref427"><sup>427</sup></a> Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting portrayal in <a href="Mel_Gibson" title="wikilink">Mel Gibson</a>'s 1995 film <em><a href="Braveheart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Braveheart</a></em>, where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots.<a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref428"><sup>428</sup></a> The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.<a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429"><sup>429</sup></a></p>
<p>Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. The director <a href="David_Bintley" title="wikilink">David Bintley</a> used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet <em><a href="Edward_II_(ballet)" title="wikilink">Edward II</a></em>, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms apart of composer <a href="John_McCabe_(composer)" title="wikilink">John McCabe</a>'s symphony <em>Edward II</em>, produced in 2000.<a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430"><sup>430</sup></a> Novels such as John Penford's 1984 <em>The Gascon</em> and Chris Hunt's 1992 <em>Gaveston</em> have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while <a href="Stephanie_Merritt" title="wikilink">Stephanie Merritt</a>'s 2002 <em>Gaveston</em> transports the story into the 20th century.<a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431"><sup>431</sup></a> <a href="Marcus_Stone" title="wikilink">Marcus Stone</a>'s painting <em>Edward II and Piers Gaveston</em> strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.<a href="#fn432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432"><sup>432</sup></a></p>
