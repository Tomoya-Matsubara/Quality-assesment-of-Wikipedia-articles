<p><strong><em>Ani Ma'amin</em></strong> (&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt; &lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt;) &quot;I believe&quot; is a prosaic rendition of <a href="Maimonides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maimonides</a>' thirteen-point version of the <a href="Jewish_principles_of_faith" title="wikilink">Jewish principles of faith</a>. It is based on his <a href="Mishnah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mishnah</a> commentary to tractate <a href="Sanhedrin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanhedrin</a>. The popular version of <em>Ani Ma'amin</em> is of a later date and has some significant differences with Maimonides' original version. It is of unknown authorship. Both <em>Ani Ma'amin</em> and a poetic version, <em><a href="Yigdal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yigdal</a></em>, form part of the prayers of Jews and have inspired varied settings to music.</p>

<p>The recitation consists of thirteen lines, each beginning with the phrase &quot;<em>Ani ma'amin be-emunah shelemah</em>&quot; (&quot;I believe with perfect faith&quot;). It follows the same order as Maimonides' enumeration.</p>

<p>Many Jews recite Ani Ma'amin at the conclusion of their <a href="Jewish_services" title="wikilink">morning prayers</a>. The poetic version <em>Yigdal</em> is more commonly recited at the beginning of the prayers. In some communities <em>Yigdal</em> is also recited on the <a href="Shabbat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shabbat</a> and <a href="Jewish_holidays" title="wikilink">holidays</a> after the evening service.</p>

<p>The penultimate line refers to the essential Jewish belief in the coming of the <a href="Jewish_Messiah" title="wikilink">Mashiach</a>. As such, this line has become a popular source of lyrics for Jewish songs.</p>
<p>The original version of the tune is attributed to the <a href="Modzitz_(Hasidic_dynasty)" title="wikilink">Modzits Hasidim</a>, who reportedly sang the song as they were herded into the gas chambers of the Nazi <a href="concentration_camps" title="wikilink">concentration camps</a>. The song was then adopted by other Jewish prisoners and became known as the <em>Hymn of the Camps</em>. It is still frequently sung at <a href="Holocaust_Remembrance_Day" title="wikilink">Holocaust Remembrance Day</a> services. Some also sang it at the <a href="Passover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Passover</a> <a href="seder" class="uri" title="wikilink">seder</a>, in memory of the <a href="Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" title="wikilink">Warsaw Ghetto Uprising</a> which began on the first night of Passover in 1943.</p>
<p><em>Ani Ma'amin</em> is also used as a positive song included at happy events, mainly weddings. The words are the same, but a much happier tune is used. The popular <a href="Chabad-Lubavitch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chabad-Lubavitch</a> singer <a href="Avraham_Fried" title="wikilink">Avraham Fried</a> has recorded a version of this song that has gained popularity, reflecting the Chabad-Lubavitch's emphasis on the imminent coming of the Messiah.</p>
<p><em>Ani Ma'amin</em> was sung by the choir during <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a>'s historic visit to the <a href="Synagogue_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Synagogue of Rome</a> on April 13, 1986.</p>
