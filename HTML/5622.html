<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>&quot;Black Cat&quot; was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson with <a href="Jellybean_Johnson" title="wikilink">Jellybean Johnson</a>. It was a departure from her prior hits, being her first sole writing credit and the first time she had worked with producers other than <a href="Jam_&amp;_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jam &amp; Lewis</a> since the release of <em><a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Control</a>.</em> The song was a stark contrast for Jackson, transitioning from her customary style of <a href="industrial_(music)" title="wikilink">industrial</a>-based <a href="dance-pop" class="uri" title="wikilink">dance-pop</a> to the <a href="Heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> and <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> genre. Jackson considered it a natural transition, having grown up listening to artists such as <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Def_Leppard" title="wikilink">Def Leppard</a>, and <a href="M&lt;U+00F6&gt;tley_Cr&lt;U+00FC&gt;e" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00F6&gt;tley Cr&lt;U+00FC&gt;e</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She previously attempted the <a href="pop-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">pop-rock</a> genre on &quot;<a href="Come_Give_Your_Love_to_Me" title="wikilink">Come Give Your Love to Me</a>,&quot; a single from her <a href="Janet_Jackson_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled debut album</a>. Jackson stated, &quot;I'm very proud of Black Cat, which is the first song I've ever written on my own, as well as co-produced.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It became the last song recorded for the album, upon Jackson desiring a rock-influenced song to complete the record.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Recording engineer <a href="Michael_Wagener" title="wikilink">Michael Wagener</a> added, &quot;Black Cat is a song she wrote all by herself on that album, and she wanted it to cross over into rock.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson's idea for &quot;Black Cat&quot; was based on a warning to a rebel involved in <a href="substance_abuse" title="wikilink">substance abuse</a>, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the <a href="folklore" class="uri" title="wikilink">folklore</a> <a href="superstition" title="wikilink">superstitions</a> of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying &quot;I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything&lt;U+2013&gt;that's the way I feel about my work.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Regarding its development, she said, &quot;I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape.&quot; She later recalled <a href="Jam_&amp;_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jam &amp; Lewis</a> saying &quot;they thought it was something that might work.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jackson was heavily involved in the song's production, stating: </p>
<h3 id="recording">Recording</h3>
<p>After playing a piano riff and singing the melody for <a href="Jimmy_Jam" title="wikilink">Jimmy Jam</a>, they recorded a rough vocal track. Jam stated, &quot;She sang me the melody, and then asked &quot;well, what do you think it needs?&quot; I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine,&quot; adding, &quot;She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: &quot;We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the <em>best</em> way.&quot; Jam contacted <a href="Jellybean_Johnson" title="wikilink">Jellybean Johnson</a> to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Johnson recalled, &quot;She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there.&quot; In addition to Johnson, guitarist <a href="Dave_Barry" title="wikilink">Dave Barry</a> was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on &quot;You Can Be Mine&quot; from Jackson's <a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">prior album</a>. Barry stated, &quot;I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, &quot;One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it&lt;U+2013&gt;she usually uses one of her other voices .. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes.&quot; Jam added, &quot;I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [voice] with kind of an edge on it. She [initially] didn't like the way her voice sounded. But for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

It was mixed by German recording engineer <a href="Michael_Wagener" title="wikilink">Michael Wagener</a>, who had not previously worked with any pop acts and was approached due to Jackson's desire to &quot;cross over into Hard Rock.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Upon collaborating, Bettencourt said Jackson was &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;beautiful,&quot; jokingly expressing his desire to marry her.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In return for Bettencourt's contribution, Jackson was speculated to provide the spoken line &quot;Did you say your prayers?

I had the song and learned the parts, the structure of it, and just went in and did it. I think we used the second take. I just wanted to get into that arena thing. It's meant to sound really big.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Jesse_Johnson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jesse Johnson</a> provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of <a href="Switch_(band)" title="wikilink">Switch</a>, showcasing more of a <a href="Heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> feel in the extended solo and double kick drums.

<p>The song's lyrical composition warns of the consequences of <a href="substance_abuse" title="wikilink">substance abuse</a>, in addition to <a href="gang_violence" title="wikilink">gang violence</a>. It portrays the symptoms of battling drug addiction with Jackson acting as a &quot;concerned lover,&quot; providing details for the general signs of the issue.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Jackson composed the song in the <a href="Heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> genre to display the aggressiveness of its theme, rumored to be written about her then-husband, recording artist <a href="James_DeBarge" title="wikilink">James DeBarge</a>. It opens with Jackson demonstrating the early signs of addication, such as breaking prior commitments of spending time with a loved one: &quot;All the lonely nights I spend alone / Never around to love me / You're always gone.&quot; The following lines, &quot;Breakin' the rules / Oh the man has come / Looking for you&quot;, depict police in search of the aforementioned man. It also refers to the drug dealer, knowing the addicted has a <a href="physical_dependency" title="wikilink">physical dependency</a>, though will continue selling drugs to them for profit regardless. The next lines, &quot;You're a rebel now / Don't give a damn / Always carrying on / With the gang&quot;, portray the next stage of addiction, in which the addicted surrounds themselves with other enablers involved in the same lifestyle. Jackson warns him of the misstep, foreshadowing their potential death if they continue: &quot;I'm trying to tell you boy / It's a mistake / You won't realize / Til it's too late.&quot; She attempts to be a voice of reason, talking sense into the addicted through musical intervention. The aforementioned man begins telling lies, showing signs of denial to avoid confrontation: &quot;Don't understand / Why you insist / On ways of living such a dangerous life / Time after time you stay away / And I just know that you're telling me lies.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Its chorus includes two folklore superstitions, cats having nine lives and black cats representing misfortune. The lines &quot;Black cat / Nine lives / Short days / Long nights / Living on the edge / Not afraid to die&quot; are metaphoric for the addict only having several times to risk their lives before it comes to an end through drug usage or related violence. The &quot;nine lives&quot; also symbolize the prospect of being caught performing illegal activity, metaphorically losing a life and allowing &quot;the man&quot; to become closer to catching him each time. He develops a longing for experiencing the <a href="Epinephrine#Adrenaline_junkie" title="wikilink">adrenaline rush</a> of escaping without being caught, following his own rules in a similar means to a stray black cat. The following lines, &quot;Heart beat real strong / But not for long / Better watch your step or you're gonna die&quot; echoes a similar sentiment of the man being someone whose proposed &quot;lives&quot; are quickly running out.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the adjacent verse, Jackson speaks of the great lengths addicts go to in order to satisfy their cravings, ranging from lying to illegal methods such as stealing: &quot;You're so together boy / But just at a glance / You'll do anything / If given a chance.&quot; The man promises to change and refrain from using drugs but does not, also breaking promises to themselves: &quot;Scheming, planning lies / To get what you need / So full of promises / That you never keep.&quot; The line also refers to the potential the man has that his addiction prohibits from being fulfilled.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In the finale verse, Jackson realizes the time invested in attempting to help the man has been ineffective, questioning why he continues to refute the problem: &quot;Don't you tell yourself / That it's okay / Sick and tired of / All of your games.&quot; Meanwhile, she attempts to convince herself to leave the relationship before the addiction has a negative effect on her own life, while the addicted continues to use denial to disguise their dependency: &quot;And you want me to stay / Better change / Makes no sense to me / Your crazy ways.&quot; The album version includes a brief prelude in which Jackson exclaims &quot;Ain't no acid in this house,&quot; implying the song's theme of a man abusing the <a href="psychedelic_drug" title="wikilink">psychedelic drug</a> <a href="Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="wikilink">Lysergic acid diethylamide</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
