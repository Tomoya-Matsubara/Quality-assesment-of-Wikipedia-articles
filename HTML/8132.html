<p><strong>Hans-Peter Briegel</strong> (born <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a>, <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a> in <a href="Rodenbach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rodenbach</a>, <a href="West_Germany" title="wikilink">West Germany</a>) is a former <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a> player and manager.</p>
<p>One of the most popular players in his days, Hans-Peter Briegel's original sport was <a href="Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">athletics</a>, being successful in various events such as <a href="long_jump" title="wikilink">long jump</a> (personal best: 7 metres 50 cm), <a href="triple_jump" title="wikilink">triple jump</a> and specifically in heptathlon-forerunner pentathlon. Briegel gained his best result as an athlete in <a href="Decathlon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decathlon</a>, but the son of a farmer struggled to compete properly in <a href="javelin_throw" title="wikilink">javelin throw</a> and the <a href="high_jump" title="wikilink">high jump</a>. So at the age of 17 he left <a href="Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">athletics</a> behind him, playing club football with hometown side <em>SC Rodenbach</em> near <a href="Kaiserslautern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiserslautern</a>.</p>
<h2 id="club-career">Club career</h2>
<p>Two years after that he was picked up by <a href="Erich_Ribbeck" title="wikilink">Erich Ribbeck</a> and Ribbeck took him to training with <a href="1._FC_Kaiserslautern" title="wikilink">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>, being impressed by the power and stamina the youngster had to offer. Ribbeck was aware that Briegel struggled to combinate football need with his physical power and presence, but as practice makes perfect, Briegel was improving. Failing to cope the needs as <a href="striker" class="uri" title="wikilink">striker</a>, he did a lot better as <a href="Defender_(football)" title="wikilink">defender</a>. On <a href="April_10" title="wikilink">April 10</a>, 1976, Ribbeck brought him on as a sub in a 4-3 win over <a href="Bayern_M&lt;U+00FC&gt;nchen" title="wikilink">Bayern M&lt;U+00FC&gt;nchen</a>. Until <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a> he stayed with local side <a href="1._FC_Kaiserslautern" title="wikilink">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> before he moved on to <a href="Hellas_Verona" title="wikilink">Hellas Verona</a> in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. It should be seen as one of the best efforts of his career that he also gained his sort of reputation and importance in a league such as the Italian <a href="Serie_A" title="wikilink">Serie A</a>, largely seen as one of the most technical in Europe. Briegel was an immediate key to success for his new club, surprisingly capturing the <a href="Serie_A" title="wikilink">Serie A</a> title in <a href="1985" class="uri" title="wikilink">1985</a> with the <a href="Hellas_Verona" title="wikilink">Gialloblu</a>. The same year Briegel was named <em>Fu&lt;U+00DF&gt;baller des Jahres</em> (<em>Footballer Of The Year</em>) in Germany, remarkable as he was the first foreign-based awardee in the history of the award.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the end of his contract at <a href="Hellas_Verona" title="wikilink">Hellas Verona</a>, Briegel changed clubs to join fellow Italian top division outfit <a href="U.C._Sampdoria" title="wikilink">U.C. Sampdoria</a> of Genoa with whom he won the <a href="Coppa_Italia" title="wikilink">Coppa Italia</a> before his retirement as a player in <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a>. Hans-Peter Briegel's success in football, based on his physical constitution, his speed and his tireless running, made him the clearest symbol for the soldier-like reputation of German football in between the years. His nickname <em>Die Walz von der Pfalz</em> is referring to both, his playing style as well as to his origin. Briegel, who scored 47 goals in 240 Bundesliga matches, was a keen proponent of the idea of playing without <a href="Shin_guard" title="wikilink">shin pads</a> and did not wear any in his career.</p>
<h2 id="germany-career">Germany career</h2>
<p>A <a href="Euro_1980" title="wikilink">Euro 1980</a> qualifying fixture against Wales in <a href="October_1979" title="wikilink">October 1979</a> gave Briegel his first chance to shine for <a href="West_Germany_national_football_team" title="wikilink">West Germany</a> and he did, enjoying his final breakthrough for his country in the mentioned tournament. He was, then, part of the runner-up campaign of <a href="West_Germany_national_football_team" title="wikilink">West Germany</a> at the <a href="1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1982 FIFA World Cup</a> and featured alike in the less successful <a href="Euro_1984" title="wikilink">Euro 1984</a>, all under the coaching of <a href="Jupp_Derwall" title="wikilink">Jupp Derwall</a>. Derwall's successor <a href="Franz_Beckenbauer" title="wikilink">Franz Beckenbauer</a> kept him in his squads and, so, Briegel was able to take part in his second successive World Cup in Mexico in <a href="1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1986</a>. He was a regular, still, but finally the key to Argentinia's winning goal in the final. Three minutes past <a href="Rudi_V&lt;U+00F6&gt;ller" title="wikilink">Rudi V&lt;U+00F6&gt;ller</a>'s equaliser and seven minutes short of the proposed extra-time, Briegel was, alongside his defending colleagues, hovering near the centre circle of the <a href="Estadio_Azteca" title="wikilink">Estadio Azteca</a> pitch on <a href="June_29" title="wikilink">June 29</a> when <a href="Diego_Maradona" title="wikilink">Diego Maradona</a>'s pass was going to get on its way to striker <a href="Jorge_Burruchaga" title="wikilink">Jorge Burruchaga</a>. With his team-mates aware, all moving forward quickly before that pass happened (to put the Argentinian striker offside), Briegel's hesitation worked as backfire for the West Germans, giving Burruchaga the chance to pounce decisively on them. Power-house Briegel tried to catch Burruchaga up in an attempt to dispossess him, indeed, but Burruchaga game-winning shot happened before Briegel's desperate tackle came to happen. With <a href="Franz_Beckenbauer" title="wikilink">Beckenbauer</a> not a true fan of his way of playing and him not having any intention to stand in the way of the coach to build a new team ahead of <a href="Euro_1988" title="wikilink">Euro 1988</a>, to be held in West Germany, the tall defender quit <em>Die Nationalmannschaft</em> with this, his 72nd, appearance.</p>
<h2 id="managerial-career">Managerial career</h2>
<p>His first job in coaching Briegel did at FC <a href="Glarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glarus</a>, a second tier club from Switzerland. He then took the ropes of German lower league side <em>SV Edenkoben</em> before he was given the role of manager at then relegated <a href="Bundesliga_(football)" title="wikilink">Bundesliga</a> side <a href="SG_Wattenscheid_09" title="wikilink">SG Wattenscheid 09</a> in <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>, a stay that didn't work out well. As a consequence he turned his back on coaching, re-joining <a href="1._FC_Kaiserslautern" title="wikilink">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> as sporting director in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>. He resigned from that job in <a href="October_1997" title="wikilink">October 1997</a> following a hefty question of authority with the team's manager, <a href="Otto_Rehhagel" title="wikilink">Otto Rehhagel</a>. He, later on, return as a director to the club, a decision that saw him being involved in a financial scandal at a time when his main job was head coach of the <a href="Albania_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Albania national football team</a>. Before he accepted the Albanian challenge in <a href="December_2002" title="wikilink">December 2002</a> (he resigned from the role on <a href="May_9" title="wikilink">May 9</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>), Briegel had various other jobs. He was assistant to Karl-Heinz Feldkamp at <a href="Be&lt;U+015F&gt;ikta&lt;U+015F&gt;_J.K." title="wikilink">Be&lt;U+015F&gt;ikta&lt;U+015F&gt; J.K.</a> in Turkey, the successor of Feldkamp at <a href="Be&lt;U+015F&gt;ikta&lt;U+015F&gt;_J.K." title="wikilink">Be&lt;U+015F&gt;ikta&lt;U+015F&gt; J.K.</a> (from <a href="September_1999" title="wikilink">September 1999</a> to <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>) and further on top of coaching at fellow <a href="Turkcell_Super_League" title="wikilink">Turkish Super League</a> team <a href="Trabzonspor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trabzonspor</a> (<a href="November_7" title="wikilink">November 7</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> - <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="June_2006" title="wikilink">June 2006</a> he agreed a deal with the Football Association of Bahrain, taking over the <a href="Bahrain_national_football_team" title="wikilink">Bahrain squad</a> from <a href="Luka_Peruzovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Luka Peruzovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. However, he was dismissed in <a href="20_January" title="wikilink">20 January</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> during the <a href="2007_Gulf_Cup" title="wikilink">2007 Gulf Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Briegel was currently the coach of Turkish Super League team <a href="Ankaragucu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ankaragucu</a> before leaving his post.</p>
