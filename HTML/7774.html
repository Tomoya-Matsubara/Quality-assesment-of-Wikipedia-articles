<p><strong>Johnny Vegas</strong> (b. <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a>) as <strong>Michael Pennington</strong> is an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> comedian.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>He was born as the youngest of four siblings to Laurence and Patricia Pennington on , having two older brothers (Robert and Mark) and an older sister (Catharine), in <a href="St_Helens,_Merseyside" title="wikilink">St Helens, Merseyside</a>. At the age of eleven, he attended a boarding-school seminary to train for the priesthood, but came back homesick after four terms.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="life-before-fame">Life before fame</h2>
<p>For a time Vegas was a <a href="Redcoat_(Butlins)" title="wikilink">Redcoat (Butlins)</a>; he studied art and <a href="ceramics_(art)" title="wikilink">ceramic design</a> at <a href="Middlesex_University" title="wikilink">Middlesex University</a> for three years and attempted to forge a career in <a href="pottery" class="uri" title="wikilink">pottery</a> but became disillusioned when he received a <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">third class degree</a>. His passion for pottery continues however to this day. He returned to St Helens, became a live-in barman and drank heavily.</p>
<p>Vegas made his TV debut as a contestant on <em><a href="Win,_Lose_or_Draw" title="wikilink">Win, Lose or Draw</a></em> in the UK under his real name of Michael, but made references to the fact he wanted to be a comedian and that his stage name was &quot;Johnny Vegas&quot;. His appearance was briefly shown during <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a>'s <em>100 Greatest Stand-Ups</em>.</p>
<p>In the mid-nineties he spent some time living in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> and <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> with the declared intention of becoming a <a href="stand_up_comedy" title="wikilink">stand up comedian</a>. In London, he was mentored by 'comedy godfather' <a href="Malcolm_Hardee" title="wikilink">Malcolm Hardee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fame">Fame</h2>
<h3 id="early-performances">Early performances</h3>
<p>Before his success in the late 90s, Vegas was a comp&lt;U+00E8&gt;re of many comedy nights at the <a href="Citadel_Arts_Centre" title="wikilink">Citadel Arts Centre</a><a href="http://www.citadel.org.uk">1</a> in St Helens where he developed his character's stage performance; in London, Malcolm Hardee repeatedly booked him at his Up The Creek comedy club in <a href="Greenwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>.</p>
<p>His career took off when he won the Festival Critics' Award at the 1997 <a href="Edinburgh_Festival" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Festival</a>, and was the first newcomer to be nominated for the <a href="Perrier_Award" title="wikilink">Perrier Award</a>. Vegas also won the Leicester Mercury Comedian of The Year Competition in 1997.</p>
<p>His early shows <em>The Johnny Vegas Gameshow</em> and <em>The Johnny Vegas Show</em> contained elements such as Butlins style sing-a-longs, onstage pottery, verbal abuse of the audience, and drunkenness. He was accused of <a href="sexism" class="uri" title="wikilink">sexism</a>. Audience members report great variation in the quality of the shows - on occasion the talent for ad-libbing seems to desert him to be replaced by a shambolic, fragmentary performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="pathos" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathos</a> in these shows is often remarked upon as it is often hard to identify how much of the apparent disintegration of Vegas is performance and how much is a genuine, guileless display of personal pain.</p>
<h3 id="major-projects">Major projects</h3>
<p>He appeared as &quot;Al&quot; in a series of adverts for <a href="ITV_Digital" title="wikilink">ITV Digital</a> around <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>/<a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> with knitted <a href="Monkey_(advertising_character)" title="wikilink">monkey</a> (voiced by <a href="Ben_Miller" title="wikilink">Ben Miller</a>), whose name was simply Monkey ('Monkeh'). The ubiquity of these adverts made Vegas a household name, though Vegas now has to fend off (and does so with good humour) remarks about the failure of ITV Digital as an enterprise.</p>
<p>Vegas gave an award-winning performance as Charlie in <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>'s <em><a href="Happiness_(television_series)" title="wikilink">Happiness</a></em>, marking his transition from stand-up comedian to actor.</p>
<p>In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> Vegas wrote and starred in a DVD-only film, <em><a href="Who&#39;s_Ready_For_Ice_Cream?" title="wikilink">Who's Ready For Ice Cream?</a></em> in which he played himself. The plot centred around Vegas's fame and success having resulted in the decline of his stand-up ability and the resulting efforts to regain it. The film was directed by <a href="Stewart_Lee" title="wikilink">Stewart Lee</a>.</p>
<p>He starred in the <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> film <em><a href="Sex_Lives_of_the_Potato_Men" title="wikilink">Sex Lives of the Potato Men</a></em>. He has displayed unshaking pride in the venture, despite very poor reviews, some going so far as to label it the worst film ever.</p>
<p>He wrote and starred in a <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a> sitcom called <em><a href="Night_Class_(radio_series)" title="wikilink">Night Class</a></em>, seemingly heavily autobiographical, about an ex red coat, pottery teacher called Johnny Vegas.</p>
<p>In <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, he co-starred in <em><a href="Dead_Man_Weds" title="wikilink">Dead Man Weds</a></em> written by and co-starring of this series is <a href="Dave_Spikey" title="wikilink">Dave Spikey</a>.</p>
<p>He appeared in the <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> comedy-drama <em><a href="Ideal_(sitcom)" title="wikilink">Ideal</a></em>, playing a drug dealer. Vegas also started presenting an unconventional Friday night chat/comedy show on <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> titled <em><a href="18_Stone_of_Idiot" title="wikilink">18 Stone of Idiot</a></em>.</p>
<p>Later in <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, he appeared in straight acting roles on <a href="BBC_One" title="wikilink">BBC One</a>, first in their high-profile adaptation of the <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> novel <em><a href="Bleak_House_(television)" title="wikilink">Bleak House</a></em> (as Krook), and then as <a href="Nick_Bottom" title="wikilink">Bottom</a> in an updated, modern-language version of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a href="A_Midsummer_Night&#39;s_Dream" title="wikilink">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, he appeared in a supporting role as 'Sackville', a poet and member of Charles II court in the film <em><a href="The_Libertine_(2005_film)" title="wikilink">The Libertine</a></em>, starring <a href="Johnny_Depp" title="wikilink">Johnny Depp</a>.</p>
<p>In February <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, he topped the bill at London's <a href="Hackney_Empire" title="wikilink">Hackney Empire</a> in a 5-hour tribute show to comedy club owner Malcolm Hardee, who had drowned the previous month.</p>
<p>In January <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> <a href="PG_Tips" title="wikilink">PG Tips</a>, a popular brand of tea in the UK, have reunited Johnny Vegas and the Monkey character in a new advertising campaign. They are emotionally reunited over the product, with Johnny notably cleaner and more sober than his characteristic appearance, presumably as PG Tips has always promoted a wholesome image and for many years used chimpanzees as humorous characters. Johnny and the Monkey had been mentioned in a show over the 2006 holiday period documenting really bad decisions (<a href="ITV_Digital" title="wikilink">ITV Digital</a>'s moribund launch, particularly buying the lesser league UK soccer rights), possibly sparking <a href="PG_Tips" title="wikilink">PG Tips</a>' advertisers to bring them back together.</p>
<h3 id="appearances">Appearances</h3>
<p>Vegas appeared on <a href="Friday_Night_with_Jonathan_Ross" title="wikilink">Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</a> and as a guest star on the music quiz show <a href="Never_Mind_the_Buzzcocks" title="wikilink">Never Mind the Buzzcocks</a></p>
<p>Vegas was well known for his impromptu rants at awards ceremonies, notably addressing <a href="Dustin_Hoffman" title="wikilink">Dustin Hoffman</a> from the stage at the <em><a href="Empire_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Empire Magazine</a></em> movie awards in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>.</p>
<p>He was given his own segment on <em><a href="The_Big_Breakfast" title="wikilink">The Big Breakfast</a></em> shortly before the show came to an end in <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> - some speculate it was his appearance that put the final nail in the coffin of this long running <a href="Bob_Geldof" title="wikilink">Bob Geldof</a> show.</p>
<p>In the same year, he was seen as a regular panelist on team B on <em><a href="Shooting_Stars" title="wikilink">Shooting Stars</a></em>, with pint of Guinness perched by his buzzer.</p>
<p>In March 2006 Vegas was a guest on the Channel 4 show <em><a href="TV_Heaven,_Telly_Hell" title="wikilink">TV Heaven, Telly Hell</a></em> hosted by <a href="Sean_Lock" title="wikilink">Sean Lock</a>. In the show Vegas voiced his opinions on various television programmes, including <em><a href="Sex_and_the_City" title="wikilink">Sex and the City</a></em>, shopping channels such as <a href="QVC" class="uri" title="wikilink">QVC</a>, (Vegas has also previously parodied <a href="QVC" class="uri" title="wikilink">QVC</a> and shopping channels in general in a sketch from <em><a href="Shooting_Stars" title="wikilink">Shooting Stars</a></em>).On May 2nd Johnny appeared in the Irish talk show <a href="The_Podge_and_Rodge_Show" title="wikilink">The Podge and Rodge Show</a> along with <a href="Jodie_Marsh" title="wikilink">Jodie Marsh</a>.</p>
<p>In early 2006, Vegas and his family were filmed for the returning series <em>Family Fortunes</em> against <em>Coronation Street</em>'s Jenny McAlpine and her family.</p>
<p>On September 15, he appeared on <em><a href="The_Charlotte_Church_Show" title="wikilink">The Charlotte Church Show</a></em> upsetting the host so much that she slapped him, and shouted 'shut the fuck up'. </p>
<p>Vegas has also appeared as the '<a href="Star_in_a_Reasonably-Priced_Car" title="wikilink">Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car</a>' on the BBC Two television series <em><a href="Top_Gear_(current_format)" title="wikilink">Top Gear</a></em>. He was the only guest without a driving licence to appear, and rounded the track in just under two minutes. In addition, he appeared on comedy quiz show <a href="QI" class="uri" title="wikilink">QI</a> alongside <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a> and <a href="Alan_Davies" title="wikilink">Alan Davies</a> towards the end of 2007.</p>
