<p><strong>William Franklin Raynolds</strong> (March 17, 1820 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 18, 1894) was a <a href="U.S._Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a> officer, explorer, engineer, and a veteran of both the <a href="Mexican-American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican-American War</a> and <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil Wars</a>. Raynolds is best known for leading the 1859&lt;U+2013&gt;1860 <a href="Raynolds_Expedition" title="wikilink">Raynolds Expedition</a> while serving as a member of the U.S. Army <a href="Corps_of_Topographical_Engineers" title="wikilink">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1840s and 1850s, and again after his participation in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. Raynolds oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds participated in surveying and mapping areas of the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>In 1848, during the American occupation of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel were the first to summit <a href="Pico_de_Orizaba" title="wikilink">Pico de Orizaba</a>, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set what may have been the American alpine altitude record for the subsequent 50 years. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first <a href="U.S._Government" title="wikilink">U.S. Government</a> sponsored expedition to venture into the upper <a href="Yellowstone_River" title="wikilink">Yellowstone</a> region that was later to become <a href="Yellowstone_National_Park" title="wikilink">Yellowstone National Park</a>. Heavy winter snowpack in the <a href="Wind_River_Range" title="wikilink">Wind River Range</a> of <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a> prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau. Consequently, the expedition was forced to diverge to the south and became the first U.S. Government expedition to cross what is known as <a href="Union_Pass" title="wikilink">Union Pass</a>, enter <a href="Jackson_Hole" title="wikilink">Jackson Hole</a> and see the <a href="Teton_Range" title="wikilink">Teton Range</a>, now within <a href="Grand_Teton_National_Park" title="wikilink">Grand Teton National Park</a>.</p>
<p>During the American Civil War, Raynolds participated in the <a href="Battle_of_Cross_Keys" title="wikilink">Battle of Cross Keys</a> during the <a href="Valley_Campaign" title="wikilink">Valley Campaign</a> of 1862, and a year later was in charge of fortifications in the defense of the military arsenal at <a href="Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Harpers Ferry, West Virginia</a>. In 1865, Raynolds was promoted to the temporary rank of <a href="Brevet_(military)" title="wikilink">Brevet</a> <a href="Brigadier_General" title="wikilink">Brigadier General</a> for meritorious service during the Civil War. He retired from the Corps of Engineers on March 17, 1884 with the rank of <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a>, after a 40-year military career.</p>

Raynolds served in <a href="Winfield_Scott" title="wikilink">Winfield Scott</a>'s <a href="Mexican-American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican-American War</a> campaign which marched overland to <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at <a href="Veracruz,_Veracruz" title="wikilink">Veracruz</a>. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first to climb to the summit of <a href="Pico_de_Orizaba" title="wikilink">Pico de Orizaba</a> () which at , is the tallest mountain in <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> and third tallest in North America.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The effort to climb Pico de Orizaba involved a long pack train of nearly fifty officers, soldiers and native guides, which started out from the town of Orizaba in early May, 1848. After two days of climbing they camped out at . The following morning, May 10, 1848, about two dozen climbers made the final push to the top of the mountain, but only Raynolds and four to five others ended up summiting.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This feat may have inadvertently set the American <a href="mountaineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">mountaineering</a> altitude record for the subsequent 50 years.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Raynolds estimated the summit of Pico de Orizaba to be  above sea level, which was slightly greater than previous estimates but below the modern known altitude. As no higher peaks were known in North America at that time, Raynolds believed Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the continent.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The American achievement was in dispute until a 1851 French expedition discovered an American flag on the summit with the year 1848 carved in the flagpole.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lighthouse-engineer">Lighthouse engineer</h3>
<p>After returning from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.&lt;U+2014&gt;Canada border which he had been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>.

<h3 id="raynolds-expedition">Raynolds Expedition</h3>

<p>In early 1859 Raynolds was charged with leading an expedition into the <a href="Yellowstone_National_Park" title="wikilink">Yellowstone</a> region of <a href="Montana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montana</a> and <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a> to determine, &quot;as far as practicable, everything relating to ... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources ... the navigability of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present to the construction of rail or common roads ...&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including geologist/naturalist <a href="Ferdinand_Vandeveer_Hayden" title="wikilink">F.V.

Experienced <a href="mountain_man" title="wikilink">mountain man</a> <a href="Jim_Bridger" title="wikilink">Jim Bridger</a> was hired to guide the expedition.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <img src="Great_Falls_of_the_Missouri_by_J._D._Hutton.jpg" title="fig:The Great Falls of the Missouri River (1860) by James D.

The wet-plate photographic techniques available at the time of the expedition provided only poor quality imagery." /> The expedition started in late May 1859 at <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, from where the party was transported by two steamboats up the <a href="Missouri_River" title="wikilink">Missouri River</a> to <a href="New_Fort_Pierre" title="wikilink">New Fort Pierre</a>, <a href="South_Dakota" title="wikilink">South Dakota</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to <a href="Fort_Sarpy" title="wikilink">Fort Sarpy</a> where they encountered the <a href="Crow_Nation" title="wikilink">Crow Indians</a>, described by Raynolds as, &quot;a small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to common report, seldom fail to hold their own with any of the tribes unless greatly outnumbered.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant to only pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, the Crows gave the expedition seven horses in trade for a few presents.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Raynolds divided his expedition, sending a smaller detachment under Maynadier to explore the <a href="Tongue_River_(Montana)" title="wikilink">Tongue River</a>, a major tributary of the <a href="Yellowstone_River" title="wikilink">Yellowstone River</a>. James D. Hutton and Zephyr Recontre, the expedition's <a href="Siouan_languages" title="wikilink">Sioux</a> interpreter, took a side trip to locate an isolated rock formation that had been seen from great distance by a previous expedition in 1857. Hutton was the first person of European descent to reach the rock formation in northeastern Wyoming, later known as <a href="Devils_Tower" title="wikilink">Devils Tower</a>; Raynolds never elaborated on this event in great detail, mentioning it only in passing.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> By September 2, 1859, Raynolds's detachment had followed the Yellowstone River to the confluence with the <a href="Bighorn_River" title="wikilink">Bighorn River</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The two parties under Raynolds and Maynadier reunited on October 12, 1859 and wintered at Deer Creek Station, on the <a href="Platte_River" title="wikilink">Platte River</a> in central Wyoming.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 1860, the expedition recommenced their explorations, with Raynolds leading a party north up the <a href="Wind_River_(Wyoming)" title="wikilink">Wind River</a>, hoping to cross the mountains at <a href="Togwotee_Pass" title="wikilink">Togwotee Pass</a>, a <a href="mountain_pass" title="wikilink">mountain pass</a> expedition guide Jim Bridger knew about. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back to the Bighorn River region. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at <a href="Three_Forks,_Montana" title="wikilink">Three Forks, Montana</a>, so they could make observations of a total <a href="solar_eclipse" title="wikilink">solar eclipse</a> forecast for July 18, 1860.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter to the top of Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass that Raynolds named <a href="Union_Pass" title="wikilink">Union Pass</a>, to the west of which lay <a href="Jackson_Hole" title="wikilink">Jackson Hole</a> and the <a href="Teton_Range" title="wikilink">Teton Range</a>.

A combination of failure to reach the fabled sights of the Yellowstone region as well as the outbreak of the war relegated the Raynold's Expedition to near obscurity, but his map was in high demand and was published in 1864.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Botanical specimens, fossils and geological items that were collected during the expedition were sent to the <a href="Smithsonian_Institution" title="wikilink">Smithsonian Institution</a> but were not studied in detail until after the war.

<h3 id="american-civil-war">American Civil War</h3>
<p>Raynolds returned to Washington at the outbreak of the war, and was made chief topographic engineer of the <a href="Department_of_Virginia_and_North_Carolina#Department_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Department of Virginia</a> in July, 1861. The army lacked adequate maps for military use, so Raynolds and his team of engineers began to survey and draw up maps of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and the region of the western portion of that state that had remained loyal to the Union and would become the new state of <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a> during the war. In 1862, Raynolds was engaged with <a href="John_C._Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;mont" title="wikilink">John C.

<p>Raynolds spent two months recovering from illness after the <a href="Valley_Campaign" title="wikilink">Valley Campaign</a>, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and <a href="VIII_Corps_(Union_Army)" title="wikilink">VIII Corps</a> in January 1863. Promoted <a href="Major_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Major</a> in the Corps of Engineers, from March 1863 Raynolds found himself in charge of the defenses of vital <a href="Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Harpers Ferry, West Virginia</a> during <a href="Robert_E._Lee" title="wikilink">Robert E.

<p>As the end of war approached and hostilities with the <a href="Sioux_Indians" title="wikilink">Sioux Indians</a> loomed, Raynolds's knowledge and experiences of the Great Lakes region became more important to the army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. Consequently in April 1864 Raynolds returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses and saw no further combat for the rest of his career.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
