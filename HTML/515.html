<p><strong>Guisborough</strong> is a <a href="market_town" title="wikilink">market town</a> within the borough of <a href="Redcar_and_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Redcar and Cleveland</a> and the <a href="ceremonial_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">ceremonial county</a> of <a href="North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Yorkshire</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="civil_parish" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> of Guisborough has a population of 18,108 and includes the outlying villages of <a href="Upleatham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Upleatham</a>, <a href="Dunsdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunsdale</a>, and <a href="Newton_under_Roseberry" title="wikilink">Newton under Roseberry</a> as well as Guisborough itself.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>For the majority of its history part of the <a href="North_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Riding of Yorkshire</a>, from 1974-96 part of the County of Cleveland and at present one of the major towns of the Borough of Redcar and Cleveland. It is listed in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> and the heavily-ruined <a href="Gisborough_Priory" title="wikilink">Gisborough Priory</a> dates back to the <a href="12th_century" title="wikilink">12th century</a>. The priory's name is spelt without the first U, as that was the old spelling of the town's name. Some other old sites and names use the same spelling.</p>
<p>Other historic sites include <a href="Saint_Nicholas" title="wikilink">Saint Nicholas</a>' <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> Church, built mainly from stone taken from the priory and home of the de Brus cenotaph, and Gisborough Hall, the ancestral home of <a href="Baron_Gisborough" title="wikilink">Lord Gisborough</a>, which now serves as a hotel and a popular venue for wedding receptions.</p>
<p>The town shared in the prosperity of the industrial revolution through its proximity to the ironstone mines of the North Yorkshire Moors. One of Teesside's leading ironfounders, Sir Joseph Pease, chose Guisborough as the site of his country seat, the Alfred Waterhouse-designed Gothic revival Hutton Hall, situated at Hutton Lowcross. This house had its own station on the erstwhile Middlesbrough-Guisborough branch of the North Eastern Railway (closed in 1964).</p>
<p>More modern residential development occurred during the 1960s and 1970's as the chemical industry (at Wilton) and steel industry (at Redcar) expanded.</p>
<p>Guisborough market, held every Thursday and Saturday, has long been a focal point of the surrounding area. Originally selling cows and other livestock, the market has gradually developed into a hubub of fruit and vegetable, clothes and flower stalls. The recently resurfaced cobbles line the principal shopping thoroughfare (Westgate) and host this event from early morning to late afternoon.</p>
<p>Also of note is Guisborough Museum, located behind Sunnyfield House (Westgate), which regularly exhibits photos of long-gone Guisborough and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Two main roads cross at Guisborough, the <a href="A171_road" title="wikilink">A171</a> and the <a href="A173_road" title="wikilink">A173</a>. The A171 leads west to <a href="Middlesbrough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middlesbrough</a> and east to <a href="Whitby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitby</a> whilst the A173 goes south-west to <a href="Stokesley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stokesley</a> and north-east as far as <a href="Skelton,_Redcar_and_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Skelton</a> where it joins the <a href="A174_road" title="wikilink">A174</a> coast road. Before the <a href="Bypass_route" title="wikilink">bypass</a> was built, traffic on both of these had to pass through Westgate, the town's main street. Just outside the bypass to the north-east, a B-road heads north from the A173 to <a href="Redcar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Redcar</a>. Another minor route out of the town, Wilton Lane, is a very windy almost single-track which leads north to the small village of <a href="Wilton,_Redcar_and_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Wilton</a>, whence one can either join the A174 or continue onto the <a href="Imperial_Chemical_Industries" title="wikilink">ICI</a> <a href="Wilton_Redcar_and_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Wilton</a> chemical works. As well as these, there are two lanes that lead out of town into the hills; Hutton Lane which ends at <a href="Hutton_Village" title="wikilink">Hutton Village</a>, a tiny settlement built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers, and Belmangate an ancient funeral route. Until <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a>, Guisborough was also served by trains from Middlesbrough; prior to <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a> it was even possible to travel all the way to Whitby and <a href="Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Scarborough</a> along the highly scenic North Yorkshire coast railway.</p>
<p>For those travelling on foot, the south of the town is bounded by the <a href="North_York_Moors_National_Park" title="wikilink">North York Moors National Park</a>. Guisborough Woods, which are <a href="Forestry_Commission" title="wikilink">Forestry Commission</a> land, clothe the edge of the moors. In the woods, the ground rises sharply and at one point forms a cliff, known as Highcliffe. The woods are crossed by several rights-of-way, including the <a href="Cleveland_Way" title="wikilink">Cleveland Way</a>, though other paths and commission tracks are considered fair game for walkers. Beyond the woods, the ground levels out to form Gisborough Moor.</p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>The two main employers in the town used to be &quot;The Shirt Factory&quot; - towards the end of its working life this clothing factory was acquired by <a href="Montague_Burton" title="wikilink">Montague Burton</a> of <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a> - and the <a href="Blackett_Hutton" title="wikilink">Blackett Hutton</a> steel works.</p>
