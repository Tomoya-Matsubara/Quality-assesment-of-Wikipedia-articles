<p>The popularity of the <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> <a href="computer_game" title="wikilink">computer game</a> <em><a href="Doom_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Doom</a></em> has resulted in a large number of <strong>spin-offs and homages</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="spin-offs">Spin-offs</h2>
<p>A <a href="Doom_novels" title="wikilink">set of four novels</a> based on <em>Doom</em> were written with permission of <a href="id_Software" title="wikilink">id Software</a> by <a href="Dafydd_Ab_Hugh" title="wikilink">Dafydd Ab Hugh</a> and <a href="Brad_Linaweaver" title="wikilink">Brad Linaweaver</a>. The books, listed in order, are titled <em>Knee Deep in the Dead</em>, <em>Hell on Earth</em>, <em>Infernal Sky</em> and <em>Endgame</em>. All were published between June <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> and January <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a> by <a href="Pocket_Books" title="wikilink">Pocket Books</a>. Some in the Doom community started calling the unnamed marine in the games &quot;Flynn Taggart&quot;, after the main character of the novels, at least for a time. The first two books featured recognizable locations and situations from the first two games.</p>
<p><img src="Rip_and_tear.png" title="fig:A panel from the comic" alt="A panel from the comic" /> Additionally, a comic book was issued in May <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, produced by Tom Grindberg of <a href="Marvel_Comics" title="wikilink">Marvel Comics</a> as a giveaway for a video game convention, and original art from that project was put up for auction on <a href="eBay" class="uri" title="wikilink">eBay</a> in April of <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>. It was criticized for ridiculous dialogue and a poor story, as well as erroneous representations of some weapons from the game. In September of <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, a member of the Doom community released an unofficial &quot;dramatic rendition&quot; of the lines from the comic, with music and sound effects, for comedic effect. Notable lines include &quot;Now I'm <a href="radioactive" class="uri" title="wikilink">radioactive</a>! That can't be good!&quot;, &quot;Sweet Christmas! Big-mouthed floating thingies! It's always something!&quot;, and (pictured below) the infamous &quot;Rip and tear your guts! You are huge! That means you have huge guts!&quot;.</p>
<p>On <a href="January_31" title="wikilink">January 31</a> of <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, a <a href="board_games" title="wikilink">board game</a> resembling the classic <a href="Space_Hulk" title="wikilink">Space Hulk</a> was released, entitled <em><a href="Doom:_The_Board_Game" title="wikilink">Doom: The Board Game</a></em>. <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/doomproducts.html">1</a></p>
<p>There is also a <a href="Doom_(film)" title="wikilink">movie based on <em>Doom</em></a>.</p>
