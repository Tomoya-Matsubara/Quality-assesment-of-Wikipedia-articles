<p>The <strong>Storm botnet</strong> or <strong>Storm worm botnet</strong> is a remotely controlled network of <a href="Zombie_computer" title="wikilink">&quot;zombie&quot; computers</a> (or &quot;<a href="botnet" class="uri" title="wikilink">botnet</a>&quot;) that has been linked by the <a href="Storm_Worm" title="wikilink">Storm Worm</a>, a <a href="Trojan_horse_(computing)" title="wikilink">Trojan horse</a> spread through <a href="e-mail_spam" title="wikilink">e-mail spam</a>. Some have estimated that by September 2007 the Storm botnet was running on anywhere from 1 million to 50 million computer systems.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Other sources have placed the size of the botnet to be around 250,000 to 1 million compromised systems. More conservatively, one network security analyst claims to have developed software that has crawled the botnet and estimates that it controls 160,000 infected computers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Storm botnet was first identified around January 2007, with the Storm worm at one point accounting for 8% of all <a href="malware" class="uri" title="wikilink">malware</a> on <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a> computers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Storm botnet has been used in a variety of criminal activities. Its controllers, and the authors of the Storm Worm, have not yet been identified. The Storm botnet has displayed defensive behaviors that indicated that its controllers were actively protecting the botnet against attempts at tracking and disabling it. The botnet has specifically attacked the online operations of some security vendors and researchers who attempted to investigate the botnet.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Security expert Joe Stewart revealed that in late 2007, the operators of the botnet began to further decentralize their operations, in possible plans to sell portions of the Storm botnet to other operators. Some reports as of late 2007 indicated the Storm botnet to be in decline, but many security experts reported that they expect the botnet to remain a major security risk online, and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> considers the botnet a major risk to increased <a href="bank_fraud" title="wikilink">bank fraud</a>, <a href="identity_theft" title="wikilink">identity theft</a>, and other <a href="cybercrime" title="wikilink">cybercrimes</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The botnet reportedly is powerful enough as of September 2007 to force entire countries off the Internet, and is estimated to be capable of executing more <a href="instructions_per_second" title="wikilink">instructions per second</a> than some of the world's top <a href="supercomputer" title="wikilink">supercomputers</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, it is not a completely accurate comparison, according to security analyst James Turner, who said that comparing a botnet to a supercomputer is like comparing an army of snipers to a nuclear weapon.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bradley Anstis, of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> security firm Marshal, said, &quot;The more worrying thing is <a href="Bandwidth_(computers)" title="wikilink">bandwidth</a>. Just calculate four million times a standard <a href="ADSL" class="uri" title="wikilink">ADSL</a> connection. That's a lot of bandwidth. It's quite worrying. Having resources like that at their disposal&lt;U+2014&gt;distributed around the world with a high presence and in a lot of countries&lt;U+2014&gt;means they can deliver very effective <a href="DDOS#Distributed_attack" title="wikilink">distributed attacks</a> against <a href="Web_hosting_service" title="wikilink">hosts</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
<p>The botnet, or zombie network, comprises computers running <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a> as their <a href="operating_system" title="wikilink">operating system</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Once infected, a computer becomes known as a <a href="Internet_bot#Malicious_purposes" title="wikilink">bot</a>. This bot then performs automated tasks&lt;U+2014&gt;anything from gathering data on the user, to attacking web sites, to forwarding infected e-mail&lt;U+2014&gt;without its owner's knowledge or permission. Estimates indicate that 5,000 to 6,000 computers are dedicated to propagating the spread of the worm through the use of e-mails with infected attachments; 1.2 billion virus messages have been sent by the botnet through September 2007, including a record 57 million on August 22, 2007 alone.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Lawrence Baldwin, a computer <a href="forensics" class="uri" title="wikilink">forensics</a> specialist, was quoted as saying, &quot;Cumulatively, Storm is sending billions of messages a day. It could be double digits in the billions, easily.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> One of the methods used to entice victims to infection-hosting web sites are offers of free music, for artists such as <a href="Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Knowles" title="wikilink">Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles</a>, <a href="Kelly_Clarkson" title="wikilink">Kelly Clarkson</a>, <a href="Rihanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rihanna</a>, <a href="The_Eagles" title="wikilink">The Eagles</a>, <a href="Foo_Fighters" title="wikilink">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href="R._Kelly" title="wikilink">R. Kelly</a>, and <a href="Velvet_Revolver" title="wikilink">Velvet Revolver</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Signature-based detection, the main defense of most computer systems against virus and malware infections, is hampered by the large number of Storm variants.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Back-end servers that control the spread of the botnet and Storm worm automatically re-encode their distributed infection software twice an hour, for new transmissions, making it difficult for anti-virus vendors to stop the virus and infection spread. Additionally, the location of the remote servers which control the botnet are hidden behind a constantly changing <a href="Domain_name_system" title="wikilink">DNS</a> technique called &lt;U+2018&gt;<a href="fast_flux" title="wikilink">fast flux</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;, making it difficult to find and stop virus hosting sites and mail servers. In short, the name and location of such machines are frequently changed and rotated, often on a minute by minute basis.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Storm botnet's operators control the system via <a href="peer-to-peer" class="uri" title="wikilink">peer-to-peer</a> techniques, making external monitoring and disabling of the system more difficult.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> There is no central &quot;<a href="Command_and_control_(military)" title="wikilink">command-and-control</a> point&quot; in the Storm botnet that can be shut down.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The botnet also makes use of <a href="Encryption" title="wikilink">encrypted</a> traffic.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Efforts to infect computers usually revolve around convincing people to download <a href="e-mail_attachment" title="wikilink">e-mail attachments</a> which contain the virus through <a href="Social_engineering_(security)" title="wikilink">subtle manipulation</a>. In one instance, the botnet's controllers took advantage of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>'s opening weekend, sending out mail offering &quot;football tracking programs&quot; which did nothing more than infect a user's computer.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> According to Matt Sergeant, chief anti-<a href="Spam_(electronic)" title="wikilink">spam</a> <a href="technologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">technologist</a> at <a href="MessageLabs" class="uri" title="wikilink">MessageLabs</a>, &quot;In terms of power, [the botnet] utterly blows the supercomputers away. If you add up all 500 of the top supercomputers, it blows them all away with just 2 million of its machines. It's very frightening that criminals have access to that much computing power, but there's not much we can do about it.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It is estimated that only 10%-20% of the total capacity and power of the Storm botnet is currently being used.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Computer security expert Joe Stewart detailed the process by which compromised machines join the botnet: attempts to join the botnet are made by launching a series of <a href="EXE" class="uri" title="wikilink">EXE</a> files on the computer system in question, in stages. Usually, they are named in a sequence from <em>game0.exe</em> through <em>game5.exe</em>, or similar. It will then continue launching executables in turn. They typically perform the following:<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><code>game0.exe</code> - Backdoor/downloader</li>
<li><code>game1.exe</code> - SMTP relay</li>
<li><code>game2.exe</code> - E-mail address stealer</li>
<li><code>game3.exe</code> - E-mail virus spreader</li>
<li><code>game4.exe</code> - <a href="DDoS#Distributed_attack" title="wikilink">Distributed denial of service</a> (DDos) attack tool</li>
<li><code>game5.exe</code> - Updated copy of Storm Worm dropper</li>
</ol>
<p>At each stage the compromised system will connect into the botnet; <a href="fast_flux" title="wikilink">fast flux</a> DNS makes tracking this process exceptionally difficult. This code is run from <em>%windir%\system32\wincom32.sys</em> on a Windows system, via a <a href="Kernel_(computer_science)" title="wikilink">kernel</a> <a href="rootkit" class="uri" title="wikilink">rootkit</a>, and all connections back to the botnet are sent through a modified version of the <a href="eDonkey_network" title="wikilink">eDonkey</a>/<a href="Overnet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Overnet</a> communications protocol.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The Storm botnet and its variants employ a variety of attack vectors, and an equally wide variety of defensive steps exist as well. The Storm botnet was observed to be defending itself, and attacking computer systems that scanned for Storm virus-infected computer systems online.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The botnet will defend itself with DDoS counter-attacks, to maintain its own internal integrity.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> At certain points in time, the Storm worm used to spread the botnet has attempted to release hundreds or thousands of versions of itself onto the Internet, in a concentrated attempt to overwhelm the defenses of anti-virus and malware security firms.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> According to Joshua Corman, an <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a> security researcher, &quot;This is the first time that I can remember ever seeing researchers who were actually afraid of investigating an exploit.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Researchers are still unsure if the botnet's defenses and counter attacks are a form of automation, or manually executed by the system's operators.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> &quot;If you try to attach a debugger, or query sites it's reporting into, it knows and punishes you instantaneously. [Over at] <a href="SecureWorks" class="uri" title="wikilink">SecureWorks</a>, a chunk of it DDoS-ed [directed a distributed-denial-of-service attack] a researcher off the network. Every time I hear of an investigator trying to investigate, they're automatically punished. It knows it's being investigated, and it punishes them. It fights back,&quot; Corman said.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Spameater.com as well as other sites such as <a href="419eater.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">419eater.com</a> and <a href="Artists_Against_419" title="wikilink">Artists Against 419</a>, both of which deal with <a href="advance_fee_fraud" title="wikilink">419 spam e-mail fraud</a>, have experienced <a href="Ddos#Distributed_attack" title="wikilink">DDoS</a> attacks, temporarily rendering them completely inoperable. The DDoS attacks consist of making massed parallel network calls to those and other target IP addresses, overloading the servers' capacities and preventing them from responding to requests.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Other anti-spam and anti-fraud groups, such as the <a href="Spamhaus_Project" title="wikilink">Spamhaus Project</a>, were also attacked. The webmaster of Artists Against 419 said that the website's server succumbed after the attack increased to over 400 <a href="gigabit" title="wikilink">gigabits</a> per hour of data, which is the equivalent of only 300 <a href="ADSL" class="uri" title="wikilink">ADSL</a>-connected machines constantly uploading attack traffic at their theoretical maximum rate of 300 <a href="Data_rate_units#kilobit_per_second" title="wikilink">kbit/s</a>. As the theoretical maximum is never practically attainable, the number of machines used may have been as much as twice that many, and similar attacks were perpetrated against over a dozen anti-fraud site hosts. Jeff Chan, a spam researcher, stated, &quot;In terms of mitigating Storm, it's challenging at best and impossible at worst since the bad guys control many hundreds of megabits of traffic. There's some evidence that they may control hundreds of Gigabits of traffic, which is enough to force some countries off the Internet.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The Storm botnet's systems also take steps to defend itself locally, on victims' computer systems. The botnet, on some compromised systems, creates a computer process on the Windows machine that notifies the Storm systems whenever a new program or other processes begin. Previously, the Storm worms locally would tell the other programs &lt;U+2014&gt; such as anti-virus, or anti-malware software, to simply not run. However, according to IBM security research, versions of Storm also now simply &quot;fool&quot; the local computer system to run the hostile program successfully, but in fact, they are not doing anything. &quot;Programs, including not just AV <a href="EXE" title="wikilink">exes</a>, <a href="Dynamic-link_library" title="wikilink">dlls</a> and <a href=".sys" title="wikilink">sys</a> files, but also software such as the <a href="Peer-to-peer" title="wikilink">P2P</a> applications <a href="BearShare" class="uri" title="wikilink">BearShare</a> and <a href="eDonkey2000" title="wikilink">eDonkey</a>, will appear to run successfully, even though they didn't actually do anything, which is far less suspicious than a process that gets terminated suddenly from the outside,&quot; said Richard Cohen of <a href="Sophos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sophos</a>. Compromised users, and related security systems, will assume that security software is running successfully when it in fact is not.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

It was described as an attempt to draw more unprotected systems into the botnet and boost its size over the holidays, when security updates from protection vendors may take longer to be distributed.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A day after the e-mails with Christmas <a href="stripper" title="wikilink">strippers</a> were distributed, the Storm botnet operators immediately began sending new infected e-mails which claimed to wish their recipients a &quot;Happy New Year 2008!&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

Its most likely use is for the cybercriminals to lease out portions of the network for misuse.

<p>As of late October 2007, some reports indicated that the Storm botnet was losing the size of its Internet footprint, and was significantly reduced in size.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Brandon Enright, a <a href="University_of_California,_San_Diego" title="wikilink">University of California at San Diego</a> security analyst, estimated that the botnet had by late October fallen to a size of approximately 160,000 compromised systems, from Enright's previous estimated high in July 2007 of 1,500,000 systems.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Enright noted, however, that the botnet's composition was constantly changing, and that it was still actively defending itself against attacks and observation. &quot;If you're a researcher and you hit the pages hosting the malware too much&lt;U+2026&gt; there is an automated process that automatically launches a denial of service [attack] against you,&quot; he said, and added that his research caused a Storm botnet attack that knocked part of the UC San Diego network offline.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The computer security company <a href="McAfee" class="uri" title="wikilink">McAfee</a> is reported as saying that the Storm Worm would be the basis of future attacks.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Craig Schmugar, a noted security expert who discovered the <a href="Mydoom_worm" title="wikilink">Mydoom worm</a>, called the Storm botnet a trend-setter, which has led to more usage of similar tactics by criminals.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> One such derivative botnet has been dubbed the &quot;Celebrity Spam Gang&quot;, due to their use of similar technical tools as the Storm botnet controllers. Unlike the sophisticated social engineering that the Storm operators use to entice victims, however, the Celebrity spammers make use of offers of nude images of celebrities such as <a href="Angelina_Jolie" title="wikilink">Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href="Britney_Spears" title="wikilink">Britney Spears</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="Cisco_Systems" title="wikilink">Cisco Systems</a> security experts stated in a report that they believe the Storm botnet would remain a critical threat in 2008, and said they estimated that its size remained in the &quot;millions&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>As of early 2008, the Storm botnet also found business competition in its <a href="black_hat" title="wikilink">black hat</a> economy, in the form of <a href="Nugache" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nugache</a>, another similar botnet which was first identified in 2006. Reports have indicated a price war may be underway between the operators of both botnets, for the sale of their spam E-mail delivery.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Following the <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> and <a href="New_Year&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">New Year's</a> holidays bridging 2007-2008, the researchers of the <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> Honeynet Project reported that the Storm botnet may have increased in size by up to 20% over the holidays.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The <em>MessageLabs Intelligence</em> report dated March 2008 estimates that over 20% of all spam on the Internet originates from Storm.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
