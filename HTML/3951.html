<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>At a party thrown by himself and his wife <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a>, <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> humiliates himself by getting drunk, telling off strangers, and leering at <a href="Flanders_family#Maude_Flanders" title="wikilink">Maude Flanders</a>. The following day at church, Marge signs up for a weekend retreat of marriage counseling hosted by <a href="Reverend_Timothy_Lovejoy" title="wikilink">Reverend Lovejoy</a> and his wife <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons#Lovejoy_family" title="wikilink">Helen</a>. Homer finds out that the retreat will be held at Catfish Lake and packs his fishing equipment, despite Marge telling him that all they will be doing is resolving their differences. On the way to the retreat, Homer stops at a bait shop and learns of the legendary <a href="catfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">catfish</a> General Sherman.</p>
<p>Back at home, <a href="Abraham_Simpson" title="wikilink">Grampa</a> babysits <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> and <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a>, who take advantage of their grandfather by tricking him into letting them throw their own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge turning into a catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and the house is a total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house. Grampa then laughs uproariously and reveals to a stunned Lisa and Bart that he faked his tears before to get them to clean the house, and they fell for it.</p>
<p>Marge attends the workshops alone while Homer triumphantly rows in with General Sherman. When he returns, Marge tells him their marriage is in serious trouble if he values fishing more than her. To prove his love for her, he lets the fish go and they return home. At the bait shop, General Sherman is still uncaught, but tales are told of a near-mythical figure who almost succeeded: &quot;Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. His eyes were like steel: cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of Hell.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="Johnswartzwelder.jpg" title="fig:The episode was written by John Swartzwelder." alt="The episode was written by John Swartzwelder." width="160" /> The episode was written by <a href="John_Swartzwelder" title="wikilink">John Swartzwelder</a>, and it was the last episode <a href="Mark_Kirkland" title="wikilink">Mark Kirkland</a> directed during his first year on the show. Kirkland and his animation team were relatively new to animation when they began working on the show, and to make the animation in this episode the best they had ever done, they incorporated all the techniques they had learned during their first year into it. Kirkland said animating Homer drunk was a challenge for him as he had to analyze how people behave when they are intoxicated by alcohol. He said of the animation: &quot;I shifted [Homer's] eyes open and close, they're not working in sync. And of course Homer can't keep his balance so that's why he's shifting back and forth.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Kirkland was raised in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> in an environment similar to the one where the marriage retreat was held. He therefore enjoyed drawing and overseeing the scenery for the episode, and the bait shop was based on the bait shops he visited when he grew up.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Snake_Jailbird" title="wikilink">Snake Jailbird</a>, <a href="Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>'s resident recidivist felon, appeared for the first time on the show in this episode, though he was not named until season three's &quot;<a href="Black_Widower" title="wikilink">Black Widower</a>&quot;. He appears at Bart and Lisa's wild house party. A woman named Gloria who seeks marriage counseling at the retreat was voiced by <a href="Julie_Kavner" title="wikilink">Julie Kavner</a>. It is one of the few times in the history of the show that Kavner has voiced a character other than Marge and her relatives. Gloria's hair was based on Kirkland's assistant director <a href="Susie_Dietter" title="wikilink">Susie Dietter</a>'s hair.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Simpsons</em> writer <a href="Mike_Reiss" title="wikilink">Mike Reiss</a> said on the episode's DVD <a href="audio_commentary" title="wikilink">audio commentary</a> that while the episode was &quot;full of funny moments&quot;, it caused &quot;nothing but trouble&quot; to the staff of the show. One of the troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent the staff a script that was almost perfectly the same story line. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with the episode.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were supposed to be at the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as <a href="Mr._Burns" title="wikilink">Mr. Burns</a> and his mail-order bride, and <a href="Mrs._Krabappel" title="wikilink">Mrs. Krabappel</a> trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out &quot;horribly badly&quot;, and it appeared as if Mr. Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on American actor <a href="Dean_Martin" title="wikilink">Dean Martin</a>, but somehow he ended up with a <a href="Southern_American_English" title="wikilink">southern accent</a> that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer <a href="James_L._Brooks" title="wikilink">James L. Brooks</a> and it was completed after several hours.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> A scene in which <a href="Moe_Szyslak" title="wikilink">Moe</a> asked <a href="Dr._Hibbert" title="wikilink">Dr. Hibbert</a> to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>In its original broadcast, &quot;The War of the Simpsons&quot; finished fortieth in ratings for the week of April 29 to May 5, 1991, with a <a href="Nielsen_Rating" title="wikilink">Nielsen Rating</a> of 11.6, equivalent to approximately 10.8 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following <em><a href="Married..._with_Children" title="wikilink">Married... with Children</a></em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book <em>I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide</em>, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the Homer vs. Marge plot was &quot;good on its own&quot;, but it was also &quot;Grampa's big moment. His final revelation to Bart and Lisa is inspired.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the main concern with the episode &quot;stemmed from its start. The scenes at the party were so terrific that the episode could have tanked after that. Happily, it didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t, as the show provided a consistently high level of entertainment. Between Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s excesses at marriage camp and the kids&lt;U+2019&gt; antics while Grampa watches them, the program packed in a ton of great gags.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In a review of the second season, Bryce Wilson of <a href="Cinema_Blend" title="wikilink">Cinema Blend</a> said &quot;The War of the Simpsons&quot; felt &quot;a bit flat&quot;, but &quot;but even in [its] lowest points, humor is easy to find.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said it was &quot;another great episode, featuring first, a new level of Homer's debauchery after drinking way to much at a party the Simpsons host, Reverend Lovejoy's marital retreat, and an epic battle with a legendary fish named General Sherman. Each of these portions of the episode are filled with laughs, perhaps the funniest being Homer's distorted high-society recollection of the previous night's events in which he is hailed as charming and a jolly good fellow.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Marge's list of Homer's faults such as &quot;He blows his nose on towels and puts them back in the middle. He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises. When he wakes up, he makes honking noises. Oh, oh &lt;U+2014&gt; and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. No, wait, he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long... and yellow!&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was the bait shop guy describing Homer as the near-mythical figure who almost caught General Sherman: &quot;Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. His eyes were like steel: cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of Hell.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
