<p><strong>Paul Paddock</strong> (born June 2, 1974 in Carmel, New York) is an American artist, lives and works in New York City. He's a painter and sculptor, best known for his water colors and mixed media on paper. His work is painted in a style similar to children's books illustrations, and deals with ideas of innocence, sex, violence, and the defiling of innocence&lt;U+2014&gt;taking place in nature. They are metaphors of the artist's personal history, experiences, and fantasies. He was formerly represented by BUIA gallery, in Chelsea (2004&lt;U+2013&gt;2009) and is currently represented by the Frosh and Portmann gallery.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
