<p>An <strong>embedded database</strong> system is a <a href="database_management_system" title="wikilink">database management system</a> (DBMS) which is tightly integrated with an <a href="application_software" title="wikilink">application software</a> that requires access to <a href="computer_data_storage" title="wikilink">stored data</a>, such that the database system is &quot;hidden&quot; from the application&lt;U+2019&gt;s end-user and requires little or no ongoing maintenance. It is actually a broad technology category that includes database systems with differing <a href="application_programming_interface" title="wikilink">application programming interfaces</a> (<a href="SQL" class="uri" title="wikilink">SQL</a> as well as proprietary, native APIs); database architectures (<a href="client-server" class="uri" title="wikilink">client-server</a> and in-process); storage modes (on-disk, <a href="in-memory_database" title="wikilink">in-memory</a> and combined); <a href="database_model" title="wikilink">database models</a> (<a href="relational_database" title="wikilink">relational</a>, <a href="object_database" title="wikilink">object-oriented</a>, <a href="entity&lt;U+2013&gt;attribute&lt;U+2013&gt;value_model" title="wikilink">entity&lt;U+2013&gt;attribute&lt;U+2013&gt;value model</a> and network/<a href="CODASYL" class="uri" title="wikilink">CODASYL</a>); and target markets.</p>

<h3 id="embedded-innodb">Embedded InnoDB</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.innodb.com/wp/products/embedded-innodb/">Embedded InnoDB</a> is a standalone, embeddable form of the InnoDB Storage Engine. Given that Embedded InnoDB is based on the same code base as the InnoDB Storage Engine, it contains many of the same features: high-performance and scalability, <a href="multiversion_concurrency_control" title="wikilink">multiversion concurrency control</a> (MVCC), row-level locking, deadlock detection, fault tolerance, automatic crash recovery, etc. However, because the embedded engine is completely independent from MySQL, it lacks server components such as networking, object-level permissions, etc. By eliminating the MySQL server overhead, InnoDB has a small footprint and is well-suited for embedding in applications which require high-performance and concurrency. As with most embedded database systems, Embedded InnoDB is designed to be accessed primarily with an ISAM-like C API rather than SQL (though an extremely rudimentary SQL variant is supported).</p>
<p>Embedded InnoDB has not seen any product updates since 2009 (and downloads currently seem to be broken), but a non-Oracle maintained fork exists with <a href="http://www.haildb.com/">HailDB</a>.</p>

<h3 id="firebird-embedded">Firebird Embedded</h3>

<p>Firebird Embedded is a relational database engine. It's an open source fork of InterBase, is <a href="ACID" class="uri" title="wikilink">ACID</a> compliant, supports triggers and stored procedures, and is available on Linux and Win32/Win64 systems. It has the same features as the classic and superserver version of Firebird, two or more threads (and applications) can access the same database at the same time starting with Firebird 2.5. So Firebird embedded acts as a local server for one threaded client accessing its databases (that means it works properly for ASP.NET web applications, because there, each user has its own thread, which means two users could access the same database at the same time, but they would not be in the same thread, because ASP.NET opens a new thread for each user). It exports the standard Firebird API entrypoints. The main advantage of Firebird embedded databases is, that unlike SQlite or Access databases, they can be plugged-in to a full Firebird server without any modifications at all also is multiplatform (runs on Linux, OS X with full asp.net mono support)</p>

<h3 id="lightningdb">LightningDB</h3>

<p><a href="Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database" title="wikilink">LightningDB</a> is a memory-mapped database developed by <a href="http://www.symas.com">Symas</a> for the <a href="OpenLDAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">OpenLDAP</a> Project. It is written in C and the API is modeled after the <a href="Berkeley_DB" title="wikilink">Berkeley DB</a> API, though much simplified. The library is extremely compact, compiling down to under 40KB of x86 object code, corruption proof, and orders of magnitude faster, more robust, more scalable, and more efficient than similar libraries like <a href="Berkeley_DB" title="wikilink">Berkeley DB</a>, <a href="LevelDB" class="uri" title="wikilink">LevelDB</a>, etc. The library implements B+trees with <a href="multiversion_concurrency_control" title="wikilink">multiversion concurrency control</a> (MVCC), <a href="Single_level_store" class="uri" title="wikilink">Single_level_store</a>, <a href="Copy_on_write" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copy_on_write</a> and provides full <a href="ACID" class="uri" title="wikilink">ACID</a> transactions with no deadlocks. The library is optimized for high read concurrency; readers need no locks at all. Readers don't block writers and writers don't block readers, so read performance scales perfectly linearly across arbitrarily many threads and CPUs. Third-party wrappers exist for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libglim/source/browse/trunk/mdb.hpp">C++</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alepharchives/emdb">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dw/py-lmdb">Python</a>. Lightning DB is distributed by the OpenLDAP Project under the OpenLDAP Public License. As of 2013 the OpenLDAP Project is deprecating the use of Berkeley DB, in favor of LightningDB.</p>

According to Raima's definition, the product is <em>embedded</em> in two senses: first, it is embedded within an application, becoming an extension to the application, second, it is possible to use it in embedded computer/OS or real-time environments because of its small footprint and efficient operation. Its APIs (for C/C++ and SQL) have been designed to support the limited resources of embedded environments. Since its initial release, RDM Embedded has been continually evolving and is currently released as version 10.1.
