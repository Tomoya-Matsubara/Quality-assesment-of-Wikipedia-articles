<p>Homeopathy came about in the late 18th century, when mainstream medicine employed such measures as <a href="bloodletting" class="uri" title="wikilink">bloodletting</a> and purging, the use of <a href="laxative" title="wikilink">laxatives</a> and <a href="enema" title="wikilink">enemas</a>, and the administration of complex mixtures, such as <a href="Venice_treacle" title="wikilink">Venice treacle</a>, which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Such measures often worsened symptoms and sometimes proved fatal.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> While the virtues of these treatments had been extolled for centuries,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Hahnemann rejected such methods as irrational and unadvisable.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Instead, he favored the use of single drugs at lower doses and promoted an immaterial, <a href="vitalism" title="wikilink">vitalistic</a> view of how living organisms function, believing that diseases have <a href="Spirituality" title="wikilink">spiritual</a>, as well as physical causes.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> (At the time, <a href="vitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">vitalism</a> was part of mainstream science; in the twentieth century, however, medicine discarded vitalism, with the development of <a href="microbiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">microbiology</a>, the <a href="germ_theory_of_disease" title="wikilink">germ theory of disease</a>,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and advances in <a href="chemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>) Hahnemann also advocated various lifestyle improvements to his patients, including exercise, diet, and cleanliness.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat. This later became known as the &quot;law of similars&quot;, the most important concept of homeopathy.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The term &quot;homeopathy&quot; was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807, although he began outlining his theories of &quot;medical similars&quot; in a series of articles and monographs in 1796.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure which would later become known as &quot;homeopathic proving&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> These time-consuming tests required subjects to clearly record all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.

<h3 id="rise-to-popularity-and-early-criticism">Rise to popularity and early criticism</h3>
<p>Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. In 1830, the first homeopathic schools opened, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> By 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Because of then-current medicine's reliance on unscientific <a href="blood-letting" class="uri" title="wikilink">blood-letting</a> and other untested, often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Homeopathic remedies, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic remedies less likely to be killed by the treatment that was supposed to be helping them.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science based medicine.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> One reason for the growing popularity of homeopathy was its apparent success in treating people suffering from infectious disease epidemics.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> During 19th century epidemics of diseases such as <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a>, death rates in homeopathic hospitals were often lower than in conventional hospitals, where the treatments used at the time were often harmful and did little or nothing to combat the diseases.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science. <a href="John_Forbes_(physician)" title="wikilink">Sir John Forbes</a>, physician to <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, said the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, &quot;an outrage to human reason&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <a href="James_Young_Simpson" title="wikilink">James Young Simpson</a> said of the highly diluted drugs: &quot;No poison, however strong or powerful, the billionth or decillionth of which would in the least degree affect a man or harm a fly.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Nineteenth century American physician and author <a href="Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr." title="wikilink">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a> was also a vocal critic of homeopathy and published an essay in 1842 entitled <em>Hom&lt;U+0153&gt;opathy, and its kindred delusions</em>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The members of the French Homeopathic Society observed in 1867 that some of the leading homeopathists of Europe were not only abandoning the practice of administering infinitesimal doses, but were also no longer defending it.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The last school in the U.S. exclusively teaching homeopathy closed in 1920.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</em> (sponsored by New York Senator, and Homeopathic Physician <a href="Royal_Copeland" title="wikilink">Royal Copeland</a>) of 1938 recognized homeopathic remedies as drugs. By the 1950s there were only 75 pure homeopaths practicing in the USA.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> However, in the mid to late 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback and sales of some homeopathic companies increased tenfold.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Homeopathy was also revived worldwide;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> for example, Brazil in the 1970s and Germany in the 1980s.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The medical profession started to integrate such ideas in the 1990s<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and big mainstream pharmacies started competing for this business.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="general-philosophy">General philosophy</h2>
<p>Homeopathy is a <a href="vitalism" title="wikilink">vitalist</a> philosophy in that it regards diseases and sickness to be caused by disturbances in a hypothetical <a href="vital_force" title="wikilink">vital force</a> or <a href="spiritual_energy" title="wikilink">life force</a> in humans and that these disturbances manifest themselves as unique symptoms. Homeopathy maintains that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the &quot;law of susceptibility&quot;. The law of susceptibility states that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called &quot;miasms&quot; to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> However, Hahnemann rejected the notion of a disease as a separate thing or invading entity<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and insisted that it was always part of the &quot;living whole&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="law-of-similars">Law of similars</h3>
<p>Hahnemann observed from his experiments with <a href="cinchona" class="uri" title="wikilink">cinchona</a> bark, used as a treatment for <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a>, that the effects he experienced from ingesting the bark were similar to the symptoms of malaria. He therefore reasoned that cure proceeds through similarity, and that treatments must be able to produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the disease being treated. Through further experiments with other substances, Hahnemann conceived of the &quot;law of similars&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;like cures like&quot; () as a fundamental healing principle. He believed that by inducing a disease through use of drugs, the artificial symptoms empowered the vital force to neutralise and expel the original disease and that this artificial disturbance would naturally subside when the dosing ceased.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="miasms-and-disease">Miasms and disease</h3>
<p>Hahnemann found as early as 1816 that the patients he treated through homeopathy still suffered from chronic diseases that he was unable to cure.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> In 1828, he introduced the concept of miasms, which he regarded as underlying causes for many known diseases.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> A miasm is often defined by homeopaths as an imputed &quot;peculiar morbid derangement of [the] vital force&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, with each miasm seen as the root cause of several diseases. According to Hahnemann, initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases, but if these symptoms are suppressed by medication, the cause goes deeper and begins to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly opposing their symptoms, as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all &quot;disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The underlying imputed miasm still remains, and deep-seated ailments can only be corrected by removing the deeper disturbance of the vital force.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In 1978, <a href="Anthony_Campbell" title="wikilink">Anthony Campbell</a>, then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by <a href="George_Vithoulkas" title="wikilink">George Vithoulkas</a> claiming that <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a>, when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that <a href="penicillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">penicillin</a> treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Campbell described this as &quot;a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally Hahnemann presented only three miasms, of which the most important was &quot;psora&quot; (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> for <em>itch</em>), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed <a href="scabies" class="uri" title="wikilink">scabies</a>, and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as <a href="epilepsy" class="uri" title="wikilink">epilepsy</a>, <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a>, <a href="jaundice" class="uri" title="wikilink">jaundice</a>, <a href="deafness" class="uri" title="wikilink">deafness</a>, and <a href="cataracts" class="uri" title="wikilink">cataracts</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including <a href="Tuberculosis" title="wikilink">tubercular</a> miasms and <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a> miasms.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="dilution-and-succussion">Dilution and succussion</h3>

<p>In producing treatments for diseases, homeopaths use a process called &quot;dynamisation&quot; or &quot;potentisation&quot; whereby the remedy is diluted with alcohol or <a href="distilled_water" title="wikilink">distilled water</a> and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called &quot;succussion&quot;. While Hehnemann advocated remedies which present symptoms similar to those of the disease he believed concentrated doses would only intensify the symptoms and exacerbate the condition, hence the dilution of the remedies. During the process of potentisation, homeopaths believe that the vital energy of the diluted substance is activated and its energy released by vigorous shaking of the substance. For this purpose, Hahnemann had a saddle maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Insoluble solids, such as <a href="quartz" class="uri" title="wikilink">quartz</a> and <a href="oyster" class="uri" title="wikilink">oyster</a> shell, are diluted by grinding them with <a href="lactose" class="uri" title="wikilink">lactose</a> (<em><a href="trituration" class="uri" title="wikilink">trituration</a></em>).</p>
<p>Three potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the centesimal or &quot;C scale&quot;, diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original solution mixed into 9,999 parts (100 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 100 &lt;U+2212&gt;1) of the diluent.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100<sup>-6</sup>=10<sup>-12</sup>. Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher <em>potency</em>, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from the dilutant (pure water, sugar or alcohol).<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10<sup>60</sup>).<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> A popular homeopathic treatment for the <a href="influenza" title="wikilink">flu</a> is a 200C dilution of duck liver, marketed under the name <em><a href="Oscillococcinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oscillococcinum</a></em>.</p>

The D or X scale dilution is therefore half that of the same value of the C scale; for example, &quot;12X&quot; is the same level of dilution as &quot;6C&quot;. Hahnemann never used this scale but it was very popular throughout the 19th century and still is in Europe. This potency scale appears to have been introduced in the 1830s by the American homeopath, <a href="Constantine_Hering" title="wikilink">Constantine Hering</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In the last ten years of his life, Hahnemann also developed a quintamillesimal (Q) or LM scale diluting the drug 1 part in 50,000 parts of diluent.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> A given dilution on the Q scale is roughly 2.35 times its designation on the C scale.

<h4 id="dilution-debate">Dilution debate</h4>
<p>Critics and advocates of homeopathy alike commonly attempt to illustrate the dilutions involved in homeopathy with metaphors.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Hahnemann is reported to have joked that a suitable procedure to deal with an epidemic would be to empty a bottle of poison into <a href="Lake_Geneva" title="wikilink">Lake Geneva</a>, if it could be succussed 60 times.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a &quot;pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans&quot;,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> which is approximately correct.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> One third of a <a href="Drop_(unit)" title="wikilink">drop</a> of some original substance diluted into all the water on earth would produce a remedy with a concentration of about 13C.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally tended to use lower dilutions such as &quot;3X&quot; or &quot;6X&quot;, rarely going beyond &quot;12X&quot;. The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines with the former stressing <a href="pathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathology</a> and a strong link to conventional medicine, while the latter emphasised vital force, miasms and a <a href="spirituality" title="wikilink">spiritual</a> interpretation of disease.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Some products with such relatively lower dilutions continue to be sold, but like their counterparts, they have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect beyond the placebo.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> <a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="provings">Provings</h3>
<p>In order to determine which specific remedies could be used to treat which diseases, Hahnemann experimented on himself and others for several years before using remedies on patients. His experiments did not initially consist of giving remedies to the sick, because he thought that the most similar remedy, by virtue of its ability to induce symptoms similar to the disease itself, would make it impossible to determine which symptoms came from the remedy and which from the disease itself. Therefore, sick people were excluded from these experiments. The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific diseases was called &quot;proving&quot;, after the original <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> word &quot;Pr&lt;U+00FC&gt;fung&quot;, meaning &quot;test&quot;. A homeopathic proving is the method by which the <a href="Profile_(engineering)" title="wikilink">profile</a> of a homeopathic remedy is determined.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>At first Hahnemann used molecular doses for provings, but he later advocated proving with remedies at a 30C dilution,<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> and most modern provings are carried out using ultradilute remedies in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> During the proving process, Hahnemann administered remedies to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a &quot;Drug Picture&quot;. The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be &quot;too exciting&quot;, though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to excercise in moderation. After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.</p>
<p>Provings have been described as important in the development of the <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trial</a>, due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of <a href="statistics" class="uri" title="wikilink">statistics</a> in medicine.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The lengthy records of self-experimentation by homeopaths have occasionally proven useful in the development of modern drugs: For example, evidence <a href="nitroglycerin" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitroglycerin</a> might be useful as a treatment for <a href="angina_pectoris" title="wikilink">angina</a> was discovered by looking through homeopathic provings, though homeopaths themselves never used it for that purpose at that time.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The first recorded provings were published by Hahnemann in his 1796 <em>Essay on a new principle</em>. His <em>Fragmenta de viribus</em> (1805) contained the results of 27 provings, and his 1810 <em><a href="Materia_Medica_Pura" title="wikilink">Materia Medica Pura</a></em> contained 65.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> For <a href="James_Tyler_Kent" title="wikilink">James Tyler Kent</a>'s 1905 <em>Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica</em>, 217 remedies underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.</p>

<p>A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings is known as a <em>homeopathic materia medica</em>. In practice the usefulness of such a compilation is limited because a practitioner does not need to look up the symptoms for a particular remedy, but rather to explore the remedies for a particular symptom. This need is filled by the <em>homeopathic repertory</em>, which is an index of symptoms, listing after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. Repertories are often very extensive and may include data from clinical experience in addition to provings. There is often lively debate among the compilers of a repertory and interested practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion. The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic materia medica was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students <a href="Clemens_Maria_Franz_von_B&lt;U+00F6&gt;nninghausen" title="wikilink">Clemens von B&lt;U+00F6&gt;nninghausen</a>, created the <em>Therapeutic pocket book</em>, another homeopathic repertory.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The first such Homeopathic Repertory was Dr. George Jahr's Repertory, published in 1835 in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> and then again in 1838 in English and edited by Dr. Constantine Hering. This version was less focused on disease categories and would be the forerunner to Kent's later works.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> It consisted of three large volumes. Such repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.</p>
<h2 id="treatments">Treatments</h2>
<p>Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The goal is to develop a comprehensive representation of each individual's overall health. This information can then be compared with similar lists in the drug provings found in the homeopathic materia medica. Assisted by further dialogues with the patient, the homeopath then aims to find the drug most closely matching the &quot;symptom totality&quot; of the patient. There are many methods for determining the most-similar remedy (the <em>simillimum</em>), and homeopaths sometimes disagree. This is partly due to the insurmountable complexity of the &quot;totality of symptoms&quot; concept. That is, homeopaths do not include all symptoms when determining which medicine is most appropriate, but decide for themselves which are the most characteristic. This subjective evaluation of case analysis relies on the knowledge and experience of the homeopath doing the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. &quot;Classical&quot; homeopathy generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms, while &quot;clinical&quot; homeopathy involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="remedies">Remedies</h3>
<p><img src="Rhustox.jpg" title="fig:Homeopathic remedy Rhus toxicodendron, derived from poison ivy." alt="Homeopathic remedy Rhus toxicodendron, derived from poison ivy." width="160" /> <img src="DoseOscillococcinum.jpg" title="fig:Homeopathic remedy Oscillococcinum" alt="Homeopathic remedy Oscillococcinum" /> &quot;Remedy&quot; is a technical term used in homeopathy to refer to a substance prepared with a particular procedure and intended for treating patients. Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies: Materia medicae and repertories. A homeopathic Materia medica is a collection of &quot;drug pictures&quot;, organised alphabetically by remedy, that describes the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists remedies associated with specific symptoms.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. Examples include <em><a href="Arsenicum_album" title="wikilink">Arsenicum album</a></em> (arsenic oxide), <em>Natrum muriaticum</em> (<a href="sodium_chloride" title="wikilink">sodium chloride</a> or table salt), <em><a href="Lachesis_muta" title="wikilink">Lachesis muta</a></em> (the venom of the <a href="bushmaster_(snake)" title="wikilink">bushmaster</a> <a href="snake" class="uri" title="wikilink">snake</a>), <em><a href="Opium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Opium</a></em>, and <em>Thyroidinum</em> (<a href="thyroid_hormone" title="wikilink">thyroid hormone</a>). Homeopaths also use treatments called <em>nosodes</em> (from the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <em>nosos</em>, disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Homeopathic remedies prepared from healthy specimens are called <em>Sarcodes</em>.</p>
<p>Some modern homeopaths have considered more esoteric substances, known as &quot;imponderables&quot; because they do not originate from a material but from <a href="electromagnetic_energy" title="wikilink">electromagnetic energy</a> presumed to have been &quot;captured&quot; by alcohol or lactose. Examples include <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a>, <a href="sunlight" class="uri" title="wikilink">sunlight</a>,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> and <a href="electricity" class="uri" title="wikilink">electricity</a>.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Recent ventures by homeopaths into even more esoteric substances include <a href="thunderstorms" class="uri" title="wikilink">thunderstorms</a> (prepared from collected rainwater).<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Today there are about 3,000 different remedies commonly used in homeopathy.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Some homeopaths also use techniques that are regarded by other practitioners as controversial. These include <em>paper remedies</em>, where the substance and dilution are written on a piece of paper and either pinned to the patient's clothing, put in their pocket, or placed under a glass of water that is then given to the patient, as well as the use of <a href="radionics" class="uri" title="wikilink">radionics</a> to prepare remedies. Such practices have been strongly criticised by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative and verging upon magic and superstition.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="isopathy">Isopathy</h3>
<p>Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy and was invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies are made up either from things that cause the <a href="disease" class="uri" title="wikilink">disease</a>, or from products of the disease, such as <a href="pus" class="uri" title="wikilink">pus</a>. Many so-called &quot;homeopathic vaccines&quot; are a form of isopathy.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="flower-remedies">Flower remedies</h3>
<p>Flower remedies can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the <a href="Bach_flower_remedies" title="wikilink">Bach flower remedies</a>, which were developed by the homeopath <a href="Edward_Bach" title="wikilink">Edward Bach</a>. The relationship between these remedies and homeopathy is controversial. On the one hand, the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical &quot;vital force&quot;. However, although many of the same plants are used as in homeopathy, the method of preparation is somewhat different, with Bach flower therapies supposedly being prepared in &quot;gentler&quot; ways, such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and so on.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower remedies being effective.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="veterinary-use">Veterinary use</h3>
<p>The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals, termed <em>veterinary homeopathy</em>, dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In the United States, veterinary homeopathy is used by <a href="veterinarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">veterinarian</a> members of the Academy for Veterinary Homeopathy and/or the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the US. In the <a href="UK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UK</a>, <a href="veterinary_surgeon" title="wikilink">veterinary surgeons</a> who use homeopathy belong to the <a href="Faculty_of_Homeopathy" title="wikilink">Faculty of Homeopathy</a> and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may only be treated by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy. The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial, as there has been little scientific investigation and current research in the field is not of a high enough standard to provide reliable data.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Other studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="medical-and-scientific-analysis">Medical and scientific analysis</h2>

<p>Homeopathy is unsupported by modern scientific research. The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations usually leave none of the original material in the final product.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> <a href="Pharmacology" title="wikilink">Pharmacological effect</a> without active ingredients is inconsistent with the observed <a href="dose-response_relationship" title="wikilink">dose-response relationships</a> of conventional drugs,<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> leaving only non-specific <a href="Placebo#Placebo_effect" title="wikilink">placebo effects</a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> or various novel explanations.

<h3 id="high-dilutions">High dilutions</h3>
<p>The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy have been a main point of criticism. Homeopaths believe that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active &quot;remedy&quot;, in contrast to therapeutically inert water. However, homeopathic remedies are usually diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Since even the longest-lived <a href="Noncovalent_bonding" title="wikilink">noncovalent</a> structures in liquid water at room temperature are only stable for a few <a href="picosecond" title="wikilink">picoseconds</a>,<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> critics have concluded that any effect that might have been present from the original substance can no longer exist.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Furthermore, since water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, critics point out that any glass of water is therefore an extreme dilution of almost any conceivable substance, and so by drinking water one would, according to homeopathic principles, receive treatment for every imaginable condition.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>Practitioners of homeopathy contend that higher dilutions (fewer potential molecules in each dose) result in stronger medicinal effects. This idea is inconsistent with the observed <a href="dose-response_relationship" title="wikilink">dose-response relationships</a> of conventional drugs, where the effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> This dose-response relationship has been confirmed in multitudinous experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes,<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> rats,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> and humans.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>Park has also noted that &quot;to expect to get even one molecule of the 'medicinal' substance allegedly present in 30X pills, it would be necessary to take some two billion of them, which would total about a thousand tons of lactose plus whatever impurities the lactose contained&quot;. The laws of chemistry state that there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> This limit, which is related to <a href="Avogadro_constant" title="wikilink">Avogadro's number</a>, is roughly equal to homeopathic potencies of 12C or 24X (1 part in 10<sup>24</sup>).<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a><a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="research-on-medical-effectiveness">Research on medical effectiveness</h3>
<p><img src="Hepar.jpg" title="fig:Old bottle of Hepar sulph made from calcium sulfide" alt="Old bottle of Hepar sulph made from calcium sulfide" /> The effectiveness of homeopathy has been in dispute since its inception. The methodological quality of the research base is generally low, with such problems as weaknesses in design or reporting, small sample size, and selection bias. No individual preparation has been unambiguously demonstrated to be different from a <a href="placebo" class="uri" title="wikilink">placebo</a>.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>Positive results have been reported, but no single model has been sufficiently widely replicated.

<p><a href="meta-analysis" title="wikilink">Meta-analyses</a>, in which large groups of studies are analysed and conclusions drawn based on the results as a whole, have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of homeopathy. Early meta-analyses investigating homeopathic remedies showed slightly positive results among the studies examined, but such studies have warned that it was impossible to draw firm conclusions due to low methodological quality and difficulty in controlling for <a href="publication_bias" title="wikilink">publication bias</a> in the studies reviewed.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> One of the positive meta-analyses, by Linde, et al,<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> was later corrected by the authors, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evidence of bias [in homeopathic trials] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most &lt;U+201C&gt;original&lt;U+201D&gt; subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a><a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2001, a meta-analysis of clinical trials on the effectiveness of homeopathy concluded that earlier clinical trials showed signs of major weakness in methodology and reporting, and that homeopathy trials were less randomized and reported less on dropouts than other types of trials.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, a systematic review of publications suggested that mainstream journals had a publication bias against clinical trials showing positive results, and vice versa on the <a href="Alternative_medicine" title="wikilink">complementary and alternative medicine</a> (CAM) journals, although it's probably an involuntary bias. A possible submission bias was also suggested, in which positive trials tend to be sent to CAM journals and negatives ones to mainstream journals.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> It also noted that the reviews on all journals approached the matter on an impartial manner, although most of the reviews on CAM journals avoided noting the lack of plausibility, unlike the ones on mainstream journals who almost always mentioned it.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, <em><a href="The_Lancet" title="wikilink">The Lancet</a></em> medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the <a href="Swiss_Federal_Council" title="wikilink">Swiss government</a>'s <a href="Program_for_Evaluating_Complementary_Medicine" title="wikilink">Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine</a>, or PEK.

<p>A 2006 meta-analysis of six trials evaluating homeopathic treatments to reduce <a href="Oncology" title="wikilink">cancer therapy</a> side effects following <a href="radiotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiotherapy</a> and <a href="chemotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemotherapy</a> found &quot;encouraging but not convincing&quot; evidence in support of homeopathic treatment.

<p>A 2007 systematic review of homeopathy for children and adolescents found that the evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhea was mixed.

<p>Clinical studies of the medical efficacy of homeopathy have been criticised by some homeopaths as being irrelevant because they do not test &quot;classical homeopathy&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> There have, however, been a number of clinical trials that have tested individualized homeopathy.

These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded &quot;that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies.&quot;</p>
<p>Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the <a href="National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine" title="wikilink">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>, says homeopathy &quot;goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics.&quot; He adds: &quot;There is, to my knowledge, no condition for which homeopathy has been proven to be an effective treatment.&quot;<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1987, French immunologist <a href="Jacques_Benveniste" title="wikilink">Jacques Benveniste</a> submitted a paper to the journal <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a></em> while working at <a href="INSERM" class="uri" title="wikilink">INSERM</a>.

Still sceptical of the findings, <em>Nature</em> assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of <em>Nature</em> editor and physicist Sir <a href="John_Maddox" title="wikilink">John Maddox</a>, American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic and magician <a href="James_Randi" title="wikilink">James Randi</a>.

<h2 id="ethical-and-safety-issues">Ethical and safety issues</h2>
<p>As homeopathic remedies usually contain only water and/or alcohol, they are thought to be generally safe. Only in rare cases are the original ingredients present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution.

<p>Critics of homeopathy have cited other concerns over homeopathic remedies, most seriously, cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases that it is claimed could have been diagnosed or cured with conventional medicine. Several surveys demonstrate that some (particularly non-physician) homeopaths advise their patients against <a href="vaccine" title="wikilink">immunisation</a>.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a><a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Some homeopaths suggest that vaccines be replaced with homeopathically diluted &quot;<a href="nosode" title="wikilink">nosodes</a>&quot;, created from dilutions of biological agents &lt;U+2013&gt; including material such as vomit, feces or infected human tissues.
