<p><strong><em>21</em></strong> is the second studio album by British singer-songwriter <a href="Adele_(singer)" title="wikilink">Adele</a>. The album was released on 21 January 2011 in the UK and most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The follow-up to her 2008 debut <em><a href="19_(Adele_album)" title="wikilink">19</a></em>, <em>21</em> was named after the age of the singer at the time of its production. While it relies heavily on the <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> and <a href="Motown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motown</a> influences that framed her debut, the album also explores various genres and styles from <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country</a> and <a href="blues_music" title="wikilink">blues</a> to alternative pop and <a href="R&amp;B" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a>. <em>21</em> is a break-up album, with the majority of the songs focusing on aspects of the singer's most recently ended relationship.</p>
<p><em>21</em> features production from <a href="Rick_Rubin" title="wikilink">Rick Rubin</a>, <a href="Paul_Epworth" title="wikilink">Paul Epworth</a>, and <a href="Ryan_Tedder" title="wikilink">Ryan Tedder</a> among others, and was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers lauding Adele's vocal performance and introspective songwriting. Preceded by lead single &quot;<a href="Rolling_in_the_Deep" title="wikilink">Rolling in the Deep</a>&quot;, the album debuted at number one on the <a href="UK_Album_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Album Chart</a>, selling 208,000 copies, as well as debuting at number one in over ten countries, including Canada, Germany and Ireland. It also debuted at number one on the U.S. <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a> Chart with sales of 352,000 copies, so far the largest first-week sales in the U.S. of 2011.</p>
<p>Following an acclaimed performance of the album's second single &quot;<a href="Someone_Like_You_(Adele_song)" title="wikilink">Someone Like You</a>&quot; at the 2011 <a href="BRIT_Awards" title="wikilink">BRIT Awards</a>, the album maintained its number one position in the UK for a total of eleven consecutive weeks, before being dethroned by the <a href="Foo_Fighters" title="wikilink">Foo Fighters</a>' <em><a href="Wasting_Light" title="wikilink">Wasting Light</a></em> on the week ending 24 April 2011. However, <em>21</em> returned to the top spot the following week and has so far spent fifteen cumulative weeks at number one. The album's eleven-week consecutive run at the top broke the record for the longest running consecutive number-one studio album for a solo artist.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It also became the biggest-selling digital album of all-time in the UK.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>21</em> has been certified eight-times platinum by the <a href="British_Phonographic_Industry" title="wikilink">British Phonographic Industry</a>, denoting domestic shipments in excess of 2.4 million units.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the U.S., the album has so far spent seven non-consecutive weeks at number one, and has sold over 1.5 million copies.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background-and-conception">Background and conception</h2>
<p>Similar to her first album <em><a href="19_(album)" title="wikilink">19</a></em>, <em>21</em> is essentially a break-up album,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> reflecting Adele's feelings toward the failure of her relationship. Prior to the album's production, her relationship achieved notoriety in the British press when it was revealed that she canceled her 2008 U.S. and European tour <a href="An_Evening_with_Adele" title="wikilink">An Evening with Adele</a> (in support of her debut album) in order to spend time with her boyfriend.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> She later revealed that a number of other personal factors contributed to her decision.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The breakdown of the relationship left the singer devastated,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> as she described it &quot;the biggest deal in my entire life to date. . .It's going to take me ten years to recover.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The singer decided to craft <em>21</em> as a confessional album in which she documented her emotional journey and channelled the pain of her break-up.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Adele originally intended to title the album <strong><em>Rolling in the Deep</em></strong>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> her adaptation of a British <a href="slang" class="uri" title="wikilink">slang</a> &quot;roll deep,&quot; which, in her words means, &quot;[to] always have someone that has your back&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> She explains that &quot;that's how I felt in the relationship that the record's about... [that] that's what I was always going to have, and...it ended up not being the case.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She decided against the title because she deemed it too confusing for audiences outside of the UK.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> While admitting the overt simplicity in titling her album <em>21</em>, the singer suggests that the name is the most appropriate for the album&lt;U+2014&gt; not only does it serve as a reflection of her age at the time of production, it also establishes a juxtaposition with <em>19</em>, symbolizing her personal and artistic growth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s [<em>21</em>] different from <em>19</em>, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s about the same things but in a different light. I deal with things differently now. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m more patient, more honest, more forgiving and more aware of my own flaws, habits and principles. Something that comes with age I think. So fittingly this record is called <em>21</em>. The whole reason I called my first album <em>19</em> was about cataloging what happened to me then and who I was then, like a photo album you see the progression and changes in a person throughout the years.&quot;<br />

<p>Many critics agreed and lauded Adele's artistic growth, praising the songs for their depth and maturity.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A critic from Clash Music.com writes, &quot;In the two years between the titles of Adele&lt;U+2019&gt;s debut and this, her second album, she&lt;U+2019&gt;s clearly seen the world. Where <em>19</em> marked the turbulent swan song to a teenage life, <em>21</em> introduces the realities of adult life, where grown-up responsibilities collide with heartache and emotional scars run deep.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="influence-and-sound">Influence and sound</h3>

<p>In interviews, Adele has stated that her exposure to American <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> provided the framework for her album's sound.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> While on her <a href="An_Evening_with_Adele" title="wikilink">2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2009 tour</a> in the U.S., Adele frequently went on smoke breaks (she no longer smokes)<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> with her tour bus driver,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> a <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville, Tennessee</a> native, who introduced her to various types of southern music styles, including <a href="bluegrass_music" title="wikilink">bluegrass</a> and <a href="rockabilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">rockabilly</a>, during these breaks.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In particular, she listened to albums by <a href="Garth_Brooks" title="wikilink">Garth Brooks</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Wanda_Jackson" title="wikilink">Wanda Jackson</a>, <a href="Alison_Krauss" title="wikilink">Alison Krauss</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Lady_Antebellum" title="wikilink">Lady Antebellum</a>, <a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a> and <a href="Rascal_Flatts" title="wikilink">Rascal Flatts</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Adele states, &quot;I find country music really exciting because I know actually fuck-all about it. So every day I'm hearing something that I love, that I don't know....It feels like I'm discovering music again for the first time.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Lily Moayeri, writing for <em><a href="Under_the_Radar_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Under the Radar</a></em>, states that &quot;Exposure to the likes of Wanda Jackson and Lady Antebellum [gave] Adele a country bent and a genuine understanding of the blues. These styles suit her retro-soul voice perfectly.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><em>21</em> relies heavily on the same <a href="Motown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motown</a> influences that informed <em>19</em>,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> with old-school, retro-infused production and the &quot;<a href="The_Supremes" title="wikilink">Supremes</a>-esque backing vocals&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> featured on songs like &quot;<a href="Rolling_in_the_Deep" title="wikilink">Rolling in the Deep</a>&quot;.

Regarding the wide range of musical styles, Adele explains: &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s all tied together by my voice...I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have a definitive sound. I have no idea what I sound like yet, so until I do, all my records will have a kind of <a href="mix-tape" class="uri" title="wikilink">mix-tape</a> vibe going on.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The album comprises mainly slow and mid-tempo ballads and <a href="torch_songs" title="wikilink">torch songs</a>,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> characterized by &quot;bold melodies [and] chest-clutching singing&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Matthew Cole of <a href="Slant_Magazine" title="wikilink">Slant Magazine</a> criticized what he thought was the &quot;formulaic&quot; structure of the songs, suggesting that the production team on <em>21</em> seemed unanimous on what constituted an &quot;Adele song&quot;: &quot;a four-minute runtime; a mixture of <a href="string_instruments" title="wikilink">strings</a>, <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, and <a href="acoustic_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a>, which should begin quietly and swell up around the two-minute mark; and a chorus which should recur no fewer than four times over the course of the song.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Adele expressed her desire to strip the songs to their basic elements in an attempt to produce a more &quot;open&quot; and &quot;articulate&quot; record than her first.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The understated nature of songs like &quot;Don't You Remember&quot;, &quot;Turning Tables&quot;, &quot;<a href="Someone_Like_You_(Adele_song)" title="wikilink">Someone Like You</a>&quot; and &quot;I Found a Boy&quot;, where Adele's sole musical accompaniment is a piano or a guitar, is meant to place more emphasis on Adele's vocal performance, giving the album a raw, uninhibited feel.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Adele later explains, &quot;It's such an honest record, and I'm really moved by it...

<h3 id="writing-and-recording">Writing and recording</h3>
<p>Adele deems her debut album limited in its depiction of her as a person, suggesting that the album's &quot;seriousness&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> contrasted with her true demeanour as a &quot;fun, cheeky, loud, [and] sarcastic 22 year-old&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> As early as April 2009,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> while still in the relationship that inspired <em>21</em>, Adele attempted to compose songs that not only explored her failing relationship,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> but would also capture her lighter, &quot;spirited&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> side. However, repeated studio sessions were unsuccessful, and &quot;Take It All&quot;,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> produced during these sessions, was the only song with which she was completely satisfied.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The main inspiration for the songs followed Adele's break-up, the majority of which began as &quot;drunken diary ramblings&quot;,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> which she later refined into musical compositions.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> They were written over a three-month period between November 2009 and January 2010.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> While Adele usually assumes a great degree of creative control over her work,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> she explained that, compared to her debut, <em>21</em> is considerably more collaborative:<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> &quot;I was really worried about making <em>'19</em> 2.0,' so I co-wrote a lot more on this record. The first record was 80%&lt;U+2013&gt;85% all written by me; this one is 55%&lt;U+2013&gt;65% me...When I was doing <em>19,</em> I was a typical stubborn teenager. I was like 'No, I can do it all on my own!'&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In a move to improve her songwriting, Adele immersed herself into various styles of music, attempting to gain insight into the structuring and composition of songs from various genres. She barricaded herself in her home for three weeks, and &quot;just listened to loads of music...<a href="hip-hop" class="uri" title="wikilink">hip-hop</a>, country, pop, loads of stuff I like already, loads of stuff I don't even like, and just trying to understand what it is about a song that moves me; where it peaks, why I think it peaks, stuff like that, just kind of studying it.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>Adele composed &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; the day after the relationship ended: &quot;We'd had a fuming argument the night before...I'd been bubbling, then I went into the studio and screamed.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> While in the studio with <a href="Paul_Epworth" title="wikilink">Paul Epworth</a>, Adele intended to write a ballad; Epworth replied &quot;absolutely not&quot;, suggesting that they write a &quot;fierce tune&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> instead. While composing the song, Adele asked Epworth to feel her racing heartbeat, which inspired the song's beat.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Adele then started singing the first verse <a href="a_capella" title="wikilink">a capella</a>, as Epoworth joined in, improvising on his <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>. &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; was recorded in less than two days.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The demo was used as the final version, as Adele's repeated attempts to re-record the song failed to capture the &quot;raw&quot; emotion of the demo.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> In an interview, Adele expressed her initial reservations prior to meeting with Epworth, due to their divergent musical styles: &quot;I wasn't really expecting anything out of the session, just because he is known for being very <a href="indie_music" title="wikilink">indie</a> and I'm known to be very pop, so I wasn't sure if it would work too well. But it ended up being a match made in heaven...he brought a lot out of me. He brought my voice out as well&lt;U+2014&gt; there's notes that I hit in that song [&quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot;] that I never even knew I could hit.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>With the exception of &quot;Rumour Has It&quot;, co-written and produced by <a href="Ryan_Tedder" title="wikilink">Ryan Tedder</a>, and &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, co-written and co-produced with <a href="Dan_Wilson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Dan Wilson</a>, the songs were all written in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. A number of studio sessions also took place in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> with <a href="Paul_Epworth" title="wikilink">Paul Epworth</a>.

The pair had a more relaxed approach to the production process: &quot;We just vibed until it felt right and there was no referencing of things in the charts that were doing well or whatever, no seeing what was hot and what was not, and there are no <a href="music_samples" title="wikilink">samples</a> used at all. I could sit here now and play the entire record completely live without any electricity. It was just so organic.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Their collaboration produced the tracks &quot;Don't You Remember&quot;, &quot;He Won't Go&quot;, &quot;One and Only&quot;, and a remake of <a href="The_Cure" title="wikilink">The Cure</a>'s &quot;<a href="Lovesong_(The_Cure_song)" title="wikilink">Lovesong</a>&quot;.

<p>On &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, one of the last songs written for the album, Adele collaborated with famed musician and producer <a href="Dan_Wilson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Dan Wilson</a>. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele wrote most of the lyrics using her guitar.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The two sat around the piano for almost a day and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, ultimately deciding to keep the musical production sparse: &quot;We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written.

<p>The order of the songs on the album mirror the range of emotions Adele experienced after the breakup,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> progressing from themes of anger and bitterness,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> to feelings of loneliness, &quot;heartbreak and regret&quot;,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> and finally, as exemplified by the last song, acceptance.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Adele describes the album's first track &quot;<a href="Rolling_in_the_Deep" title="wikilink">Rolling in the Deep</a>&quot; as a &lt;U+201C&gt;dark, bluesy, gospel, disco tune.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> She states, &quot;[the song] is my reaction to being told [by my ex] that my life is going to be boring and lonely and rubbish, and that I was a weak person if I didn't stay in the relationship.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> And I wrote that as a sort of 'fuck you'.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The song begins with Adele singing against a steady guitar strum, then continues with &quot;martial beats&quot;, &quot;pounding piano chords&quot; (played by <a href="Neil_Cowley" title="wikilink">Neil Cowley</a>) and &quot;chanting <a href="backing_vocalist" title="wikilink">backing singers</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> followed by a broken down, hand-clapping bridge reminiscent of the soul music of the <a href="deep_south" title="wikilink">deep south</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> One of the more uptempo songs on the album,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> the <a href="Ryan_Tedder" title="wikilink">Ryan Tedder</a>-produced &quot;Rumour Has It&quot; is a percussion-driven jazz number,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> which Adele describes as a &quot;bluesy pop stomping song&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Adele states that the song was not inspired by her ex, but was written about her own friends, who had a tendency to spread rumours about her break-up.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The song contrasts with the second Tedder-collaborated song &quot;Turning Tables&quot;, the albums third track, produced by <a href="Jim_Abbiss" title="wikilink">Jim Abbiss</a>. &quot;Turning Tables&quot; was conceived following a confrontation with Adele's ex. Adele arrived at the studio upset and emotional that her ex kept &quot;turning the tables&quot; on her during their arguments, and Tedder used this idea as a concept for composing the song.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Lyrically, the song describes the stage of the relationship marked by constant fighting and contention, followed by the realization that the relationship has run its course. The song begins as an understated piano-and-vocal ballad, stripped down to its most minimal elements, and towards the climax, swells into a &quot;cinematic pop anthem laced with Broadway-worthy strings&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> that &quot;serves as a fitting counterpoint to its heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>As the album progresses, the theme changes from one of anger and defensiveness to feelings of reflection and heartbreak, exemplified by the Rick Rubin produced &quot;Don&lt;U+2019&gt;t You Remember&quot;, co-written by Adele and <a href="Dan_Wilson_(musician)" title="wikilink">Dan Wilson</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> A country styled ballad,<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> the song was one of the last to be composed for the album.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> After completing a number of songs, Adele had become aware of how her bitterness towards the break-up had negatively coloured her perception of her ex: &quot;I managed to step out of the bitter mode that I was in when I was writing the record and I suddenly got really ashamed and disgusted with the manner that I was portraying someone who was really important to me...and I felt really childish that I had made him out to be a complete twat.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The song is an admission of her own shortcomings, as well as a plea to her ex to remember why he initially fell in love with her.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The album's fifth track, &quot;<a href="Set_Fire_to_the_Rain" title="wikilink">Set Fire to the Rain</a>&quot; was written with producer <a href="Fraser_T._Smith" title="wikilink">Fraser T.

<p>One of the only love songs not written about her ex was &quot;One and Only.&quot; The song, which dares a love interest to take a chance on a relationship, is aimed at a friend for whom Adele had always cared about.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> &quot;Lovesong&quot;, a bossa-nova style<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> remake of the song by <a href="The_Cure" title="wikilink">The Cure</a>, received mixed critical reception from critics.
