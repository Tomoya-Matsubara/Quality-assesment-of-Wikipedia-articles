With assets that include franchises in three of the six <a href="major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada" title="wikilink">major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada</a>, it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in North America.</p>
<p>The primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the <a href="Toronto_Maple_Leafs" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> of the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a>, <a href="Toronto_Raptors" title="wikilink">Toronto Raptors</a> of the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a> and <a href="Toronto_FC" title="wikilink">Toronto FC</a> of <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a>, as well as the minor league <a href="Toronto_Marlies" title="wikilink">Toronto Marlies</a> of the <a href="American_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">American Hockey League</a> and an <a href="Toronto_USL_Pro_team" title="wikilink">unnamed soccer team</a> to be launched in the <a href="USL_PRO" title="wikilink">USL PRO</a> in 2015. In addition, it owns the <a href="Air_Canada_Centre" title="wikilink">Air Canada Centre</a>, the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors. MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including <a href="BMO_Field" title="wikilink">BMO Field</a>, home of Toronto FC, <a href="Ricoh_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Ricoh Coliseum</a>, home of the Marlies, <a href="MasterCard_Centre" title="wikilink">MasterCard Centre</a>, the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies, <a href="KIA_Training_Ground" title="wikilink">KIA Training Ground</a>, practice facility for Toronto FC and home of the <a href="TFC_Academy" title="wikilink">TFC Academy</a>, and <a href="Lamport_Stadium" title="wikilink">Lamport Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>MLSE was founded by <a href="Conn_Smythe" title="wikilink">Conn Smythe</a> in 1931 as Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) to act as a <a href="holding_company" title="wikilink">holding company</a> for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena <a href="Maple_Leaf_Gardens" title="wikilink">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>, from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL, and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of <a href="professional_ice_hockey" title="wikilink">minor</a> and <a href="junior_hockey" title="wikilink">junior hockey</a> clubs including the <a href="Toronto_Marlboros" title="wikilink">Toronto Marlboros</a> of the <a href="Ontario_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">Ontario Hockey Association</a>, the company later branched out to own the <a href="Hamilton_Tiger-Cats" title="wikilink">Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a> of the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. Most recently the company launched Toronto FC in 2007.</p>
<p>Over most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a <a href="public_company" title="wikilink">public company</a>. Following the death of majority owner <a href="Harold_Ballard" title="wikilink">Harold Ballard</a> in 1990, <a href="Steve_Stavro" title="wikilink">Steve Stavro</a> led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it <a href="Privately_held_company" title="wikilink">private</a>. Most recently, the <a href="Ontario_Teachers&#39;_Pension_Plan" title="wikilink">Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</a> sold their 79.53% share of the company for $1.32 billion to a joint venture between <a href="Rogers_Communications" title="wikilink">Rogers Communications</a> and <a href="Bell_Canada" title="wikilink">Bell Canada</a>, two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of $1.66 billion and an enterprise value of $2 billion. (All figures are in <a href="Canadian_dollars" title="wikilink">Canadian dollars</a> (CAD) unless otherwise specified.) Although the company has proven to be very profitable, they have had much less success at producing winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their <a href="1967_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1967 Stanley Cup</a>. The only other major championship the company has won was the <a href="74th_Grey_Cup" title="wikilink">74th Grey Cup</a> in 1986 by the Tiger-Cats.</p>

The club was playing poorly and minority partner <a href="Jack_Bickell" title="wikilink">Jack Bickell</a> contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team. However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former <a href="Toronto_Blueshirts" title="wikilink">Toronto Blueshirts</a> owner <a href="Eddie_Livingstone" title="wikilink">Eddie Livingstone</a>, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that would move the team to <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After Bickell contacted Smythe to inform him of the sale, Smythe persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats. Smythe himself invested $10,000 of his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further $75,000 due 30 days later, with Bickell retaining his $40,000 share in the team.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The deal was finalized on Valentine's Day,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the new owners quickly renamed the team the <a href="Toronto_Maple_Leafs" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Later that year, Smythe bought the <a href="junior_hockey" title="wikilink">junior hockey</a> <a href="Toronto_Marlboros" title="wikilink">Toronto Marlboros</a> of the <a href="Ontario_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">Ontario Hockey Association</a> to serve as a developmental team for Maple Leafs.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. Their then home, the <a href="Arena_Gardens" title="wikilink">Arena Gardens</a>, which they shared with the Marlboros,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> had been built in 1912 and seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were regularly filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from <a href="Eaton&#39;s" title="wikilink">The T. Eaton Co. Ltd.</a> for $350,000,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> a price said to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of <a href="Ross_and_Macdonald" title="wikilink">Ross and Macdonald</a>. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from <a href="Sun_Life" title="wikilink">Sun Life</a> for half of the expected $1 million cost<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named <a href="Maple_Leaf_Gardens" title="wikilink">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> (MLG).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each ($ in  dollars), with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares.

The Marlboros also moved to the new arena.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>To help fill dates at the new arena, Smythe acquired an expansion franchise in the professional <a href="International_Lacrosse_League" title="wikilink">International Lacrosse League</a> on behalf of MLGL for the 1932 season,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> which was also given the name the <a href="Toronto_Maple_Leafs_(ILL)" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A team named the <a href="Toronto_Tecumsehs_(ILL)" title="wikilink">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> had competed in the first season of the ILL at the <a href="Arena_Gardens" title="wikilink">Arena Gardens</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> but was renamed the Tecumsehs with the arrival of Smythe's team.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Both teams played at MLG.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Smythe pulled out following the season due to financial losses,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and the league did not play the following year.</p>

<p>Although Conn Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with <a href="Frank_J._Selke" title="wikilink">Frank J. Selke</a>. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder <a href="Percy_Gardiner" title="wikilink">Percy Gardiner</a>, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a> and installed himself as president on 19 November 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a><a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"><sup>406</sup></a><a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"><sup>407</sup></a> The loan was paid off in 1960.<a href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"><sup>408</sup></a> In November 1961 Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by <a href="Stafford_Smythe" title="wikilink">Stafford Smythe</a> (Conn Smythe's son), <a href="Harold_Ballard" title="wikilink">Harold Ballard</a> and <a href="John_Bassett" title="wikilink">John Bassett</a>, who at the time owned part of the <a href="Toronto_Argonauts" title="wikilink">Toronto Argonauts</a> of the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> and <a href="Toronto_Telegram" title="wikilink">Toronto Telegram</a>, for $2.3 million.

<h3 id="harold-ballard-john-bassett-and-stafford-smythe">Harold Ballard, John Bassett and Stafford Smythe</h3>
<p>In March 1966 Conn sold his remaining shares and resigned from the board of directors after a <a href="Muhammad_Ali" title="wikilink">Muhammad Ali</a> boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a> to be offensive,<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a> and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had &quot;put cash ahead of class.&quot;<a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420"><sup>420</sup></a> Within three years under the new owners, profits at MLGL had tripled to just under $1 million. Ballard negotiated lucrative deals to place advertising throughout the building, and greatly increased the number of seats in the arena.<a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"><sup>421</sup></a></p>
<p>Following a <a href="Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police" title="wikilink">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> raid at MLG in 1968, Stafford was charged with income tax evasion, and he and Ballard were accused of illegally taking money from MLGL to pay for renovations of their houses and other personal expenses. Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. Following an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;7 vote of the board of directors on 26 June 1969, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board. This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them. They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970 and Stafford was once again appointed president.<a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref422"><sup>422</sup></a> Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 shares he controlled in MLGL to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argos.<a href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423"><sup>423</sup></a><a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424"><sup>424</sup></a><a href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425"><sup>425</sup></a> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford Smythe-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<a href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref426"><sup>426</sup></a><a href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref427"><sup>427</sup></a> Ballard would be convicted of 47 charges<a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref428"><sup>428</sup></a> and sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary, but Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at the age of only 50 just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429"><sup>429</sup></a><a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430"><sup>430</sup></a><a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431"><sup>431</sup></a> Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an <a href="executor" class="uri" title="wikilink">executor</a>,<a href="#fn432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432"><sup>432</sup></a> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.

<p>In 1966 Ballard set up a family <a href="holding_company" title="wikilink">holding company</a>, named Harold E. Ballard Ltd.

<p>Following the merger, the ownership structure of the now defunct MLGV was retained by MLGL. MLGH was the majority owner of MLGL, holding 51% of the company.

<p>In December 2010 it was reported that <a href="Rogers_Communications" title="wikilink">Rogers Communications</a>, owner of the Toronto Blue Jays, was in negotiations to purchase the Teachers' 66% stake in MLSE, with the asking price set at $1.3 billion,<a href="#fn584" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref584"><sup>584</sup></a><a href="#fn585" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref585"><sup>585</sup></a> and in March 2011 Teachers' confirmed that their share in the company was for up for sale.<a href="#fn586" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref586"><sup>586</sup></a><a href="#fn587" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref587"><sup>587</sup></a> Tanenbaum's right of first refusal on the shares gave him control over any sale by Teachers'.<a href="#fn588" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref588"><sup>588</sup></a><a href="#fn589" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref589"><sup>589</sup></a> In May 2011 Teachers' announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase TD Capital's 13.5% ownership share, giving them 79.5% of the company and leaving Tanenbaum as the only minority partner with 20.5%, simplifying a sale of their shares.<a href="#fn590" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref590"><sup>590</sup></a><a href="#fn591" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591"><sup>591</sup></a> In November 2011 Teachers' announced that they were taking the company off the market.<a href="#fn592" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref592"><sup>592</sup></a> However, only a couple of weeks later, on 9 December 2011, Teachers' announced the sale of its entire stake in MLSE to a partnership between <a href="Bell_Canada" title="wikilink">Bell Canada</a> and <a href="Rogers_Communications" title="wikilink">Rogers Communications</a>, in a deal valued at <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>1.32 billion,<a href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref593"><sup>593</sup></a><a href="#fn594" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref594"><sup>594</sup></a> giving the company an <a href="equity_value" title="wikilink">equity value</a> of $1.66 billion and an <a href="enterprise_value" title="wikilink">enterprise value</a> of $2 billion.<a href="#fn595" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref595"><sup>595</sup></a><a href="#fn596" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref596"><sup>596</sup></a> As part of the deal, Tanenbaum increased his stake in the company to 25%.<a href="#fn597" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref597"><sup>597</sup></a><a href="#fn598" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref598"><sup>598</sup></a><a href="#fn599" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref599"><sup>599</sup></a> The deal required the approval of Canada's <a href="Competition_Bureau" title="wikilink">Competition Bureau</a>, the <a href="Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission" title="wikilink">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</a> (with regards to MLSE's TV channels), as well as the NHL, the AHL, the NBA, and MLS (with regards to each of MLSE's main sports franchises).</p>
<p>The Competition Bureau announced in May 2012 that it would not challenge the transaction, but that it will &quot;actively review&quot; the situation in light of &quot;serious concerns&quot; expressed by various parties, reserving the right to take action at a later date.<a href="#fn600" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref600"><sup>600</sup></a> The NHL Board of Governors approved the sale at a meeting in Las Vegas on 19 June 2012.<a href="#fn601" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref601"><sup>601</sup></a> The final approval, that of the CRTC, was granted on 16 August, with the commission noting that it only had jurisdiction over the TV channels owned by MLSE (the transfer of ownership of which, it decided, posed no major concerns), and not the broadcast rights associated with MLSE's teams.<a href="#fn602" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref602"><sup>602</sup></a> The transaction closed on 22 August 2012.<a href="#fn603" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref603"><sup>603</sup></a></p>










<p>As part of the sale, two <a href="numbered_companies" title="wikilink">numbered companies</a> were created to jointly hold stock. Following the restructuring, the ownership hierarchy of MLSE was:<a href="#fn604" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref604"><sup>604</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>8047286 Canada Inc. (Rogers/Bell <a href="joint_venture" title="wikilink">joint</a> holding company) &lt;U+2013&gt; 75%
<ul>
<li><a href="Rogers_Communications" title="wikilink">Rogers Communications</a> – 50% (net ownership 37.5%)</li>
<li>7680147 Canada Inc. (Bell holding company) – 50%

<li><a href="Bell_Canada" title="wikilink">Bell Canada Enterprises</a> – 74.67% (net ownership 28%)</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kilmer Sports (holding company of <a href="Larry_Tanenbaum" title="wikilink">Larry Tanenbaum</a>) – 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>This ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75% interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus of the two. (If Rogers and Bell owned their interests directly, either Rogers or Bell could be overruled by its competitor in combination with Tanenbaum.) As such, Rogers and Bell have agreed that their previously four of six (now six of eight) directors on the MLSE board will always vote together, and thus that any disagreements between the two companies will be settled privately without the involvement of Tanenbaum.<a href="#fn606" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref606"><sup>606</sup></a><a href="#fn607" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref607"><sup>607</sup></a> Bell has indicated that the involvement of Bell's pension fund is, at least in part, intended to ensure Bell can retain its existing 18% interest in the <a href="Montreal_Canadiens" title="wikilink">Montreal Canadiens</a>, as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30% of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team.<a href="#fn608" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref608"><sup>608</sup></a></p>
