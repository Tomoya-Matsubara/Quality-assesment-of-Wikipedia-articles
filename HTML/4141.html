<p>In 1985, Canseco won the <a href="Baseball_America_Minor_League_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award</a>, and was a late season call-up for the <a href="Oakland_Athletics" title="wikilink">Oakland Athletics</a>, playing in 29 games in the major leagues in . He gained notoriety in , his first full season, being named the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a>'s <a href="MLB_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Rookie of the Year</a>, with 33 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> and 117 <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a>. In , <a href="Mark_McGwire" title="wikilink">Mark McGwire</a> joined Canseco on the Athletics; McGwire hit 49 home runs that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, he and Canseco formed a fearsome offensive tandem, known as the &quot;Bash Brothers&quot;.</p>
<p>In , Canseco became the first player in major league history to <a href="40-40_club" title="wikilink">hit at least 40 home runs and steal at least 40 bases</a> in the same year, by hitting 42 home runs and stealing 40 bases. After that, the street in front of his former high school was named after him and later rescinded in 2008 after he admitted to previously using drugs throughout his career.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> That same year, he helped the Athletics to the <a href="1988_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> but they lost to the <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in five games.

<p>Canseco came back to form in , hitting 37 home runs despite being hampered in the latter part of the season by what would become a recurring back problem. The A's returned to the <a href="1990_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> once again, but were swept by the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> in four games. Canseco continued to be productive, hitting 44 home runs in , but his career hit a plateau, and in the face of frequent injuries and controversy he never accomplished what many felt he was capable of.</p>

He won the AL Silver Slugger award, but his comeback was missed by most fans because of the home run race in the National League between Mark McGwire and <a href="Sammy_Sosa" title="wikilink">Sammy Sosa</a>.</p>

<p>At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while McGwire repeatedly and somewhat conspicuously refused to answer questions on his own suspected use, saying he &quot;didn't want to talk about the past.&quot; Canseco's book became a <a href="New_York_Times_bestseller_list" title="wikilink"><em>New York Times</em> bestseller</a>.

However, on February 7, 2009, <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated</a></em> reported that A-Rod did test positive during his 2003 season, which could make Canseco's book seem more real than it was believed.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Finally, on Monday, February 9, 2009 A-Rod confirmed Canseco's previous allegations of steroids use in an exclusive interview; A-Rod admits to using steroids from 2001 to 2003.
