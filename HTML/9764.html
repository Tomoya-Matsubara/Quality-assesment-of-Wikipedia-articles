It stars <a href="Vidya_Balan" title="wikilink">Vidya Balan</a> as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in <a href="Kolkata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kolkata</a> during the festival of <a href="Durga_Puja" title="wikilink">Durga Puja</a>, assisted by Satyaki &quot;Rana&quot; Sinha (<a href="Parambrata_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Parambrata Chatterjee</a>) and Khan (<a href="Nawazuddin_Siddiqui" title="wikilink">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a>).</p>

Shot in Kolkata, the crew often employed <a href="guerrilla_filmmaking" title="wikilink">guerrilla-filmmaking</a> techniques on the city's streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. <em>Kahaani</em> explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to <a href="Satyajit_Ray" title="wikilink">Satyajit Ray</a>'s films such as <em><a href="Charulata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charulata</a></em> (1964) and <em><a href="Aranyer_Dinratri" title="wikilink">Aranyer Dinratri</a></em> (1970).</p>
<p><em>Kahaani</em> was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Due to critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film became a <a href="sleeper_hit" title="wikilink">sleeper hit</a>, earning  worldwide in 50 days. At the end of its theatrical run the film won several awards, including three <a href="National_Film_Awards" title="wikilink">National Film Awards</a> and five <a href="Filmfare_Awards" title="wikilink">Filmfare Awards</a>. The latter included trophies for <a href="Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Director" title="wikilink">Best Director</a> (Ghosh) and <a href="Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="wikilink">Best Actress</a> (Balan).</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The film opens with a poison-gas attack on a <a href="Kolkata_Metro" title="wikilink">Kolkata Metro Rail</a> compartment, killing the passengers on board. Two years later Vidya Bagchi (<a href="Vidya_Balan" title="wikilink">Vidya Balan</a>), a pregnant <a href="software_engineer" title="wikilink">software engineer</a>, arrives in <a href="Kolkata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kolkata</a> from London during the <a href="Durga_Puja" title="wikilink">Durga Puja</a> festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyaki &quot;Rana&quot; Sinha (<a href="Parambrata_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Parambrata Chatterjee</a>), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.</p>
<p>Agnes D'mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji (<a href="Indraneil_Sengupta" title="wikilink">Indraneil Sengupta</a>), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (<a href="Saswata_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Saswata Chatterjee</a>), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two <a href="Intelligence_Bureau_(India)" title="wikilink">Intelligence Bureau</a> (IB) officials in DelhiÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; the chief Bhaskaran K. (<a href="Dhritiman_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Dhritiman Chatterjee</a>) and his deputy Khan (<a href="Nawazuddin_Siddiqui" title="wikilink">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a>). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.</p>
<p>The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a <a href="Tempo_(car)" title="wikilink">Tempo</a> during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an <a href="IP_address" title="wikilink">IP address</a> sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.</p>
<p>Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.</p>
<p>Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a <a href="USB_flash_drive" title="wikilink">pen drive</a> containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.</p>
<p>Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu (<a href="Abir_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Abir Chatterjee</a>), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack. In her mission to avenge his death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee (<a href="Darshan_Jariwala" title="wikilink">Darshan Jariwala</a>), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.</p>

<p><a href="Sujoy_Ghosh" title="wikilink">Sujoy Ghosh</a> approached novelist and script-writer Advaita Kala with the idea for the film.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had followed her boyfriend in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Her research included reading the books <em>Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled</em> by Maloy Krishna Dhar and <em>India's External Intelligence: Secrets of <a href="Research_and_Analysis_Wing" title="wikilink">Research and Analysis Wing</a> (RAW)</em> by V. K. Singh.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Ghosh, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay, began to plan the film while awaiting the release of his previous film <em><a href="Aladin_(2009_film)" title="wikilink">Aladin</a></em> (2009), but the dismal response to <em>Aladin</em> was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for <em>Kahaani</em>, but was refused<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Yashraj_Films" title="wikilink">Yashraj Films</a> were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined because he did not want that much commitment.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Bengali film actor <a href="Prosenjit_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Prosenjit Chatterjee</a> encouraged Ghosh to shoot in Kolkata.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ghosh finally selected Kolkata for several reasons: the director's acquaintance with the city, its mix of modernity and old-world charm,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and budget constraints. Kolkata is a cheaper location than Mumbai or Delhi, where most Bollywood films are shot.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Ghosh admitted in an interview that after his two preceding directorial venturesÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; <em>Aladin</em> and <em><a href="Home_Delivery_(film)" title="wikilink">Home Delivery</a></em> (2005)Â &lt;U+2013&gt; performed miserably at the box office, <em>Kahaani</em> was his last chance to create a niche as a director.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Ghosh chose mostly Bengali actors as he wanted to make the characters as authentic as possible.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The role of the Inspector Satyaki &quot;Rana&quot; Sinha was first offered to <a href="Chandan_Roy_Sanyal" title="wikilink">Chandan Roy Sanyal</a>, but he could not take the part due to other commitments.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Parambrata Chatterjee, a <a href="Cinema_of_West_Bengal" title="wikilink">Bengali actor</a> whose acting in the film <em><a href="The_Bong_Connection" title="wikilink">The Bong Connection</a></em> (2006) had impressed Ghosh at the <a href="Mumbai_Academy_of_the_Moving_Image" title="wikilink">Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image</a> festival, was later offered the role in <em>Kahaani</em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Chatterjee had earlier worked with Balan in her d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but film <em><a href="Bhalo_Theko" title="wikilink">Bhalo Theko</a></em> (2003).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The casting director Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui for the role of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised that for the first time he would not have to portray a beggar.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Balan's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
<p>Before the shooting of the film began, Balan started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women to learn about the typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Balan said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during the shooting.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>While briefing Saswata Chatterjee about his character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh used the phrase <em>&quot;Binito Bob&quot;</em> (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well- noted and praised by the viewers.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Ghosh was surprised at how Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Parambrata Chatterjee said in an interview that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research &quot;on their work, mindset and other relevant things&quot; to prepare for the role.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, and wondered how he could portray the arrogance needed for the character.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism. Khan smokes a relatively cheap brand of cigarette (<a href="Gold_Flake" title="wikilink">Gold Flake</a>) despite his high official post; Siddiqui had smoked that brand of cigarette throughout his struggling days in Bollywood and thereafter.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in <em>Sindoor khela</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply <em><a href="sindoor" class="uri" title="wikilink">sindoor</a></em> (vermilion) on Balan's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to <em>sindoor</em> could be avoided.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Ghosh chose the guest house in which the protagonist stays after noticing it during his visit to a neighbouring hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for , and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>A recurring theme is the fleeting hint of romance between Rana and Vidya. Ghosh said that this delicate romance was &quot;the most progressive thing&quot; in the film&lt;U+2014&gt;a suggestion that a man could fall in love with a pregnant woman. The director explained that the boy was initially &quot;fascinated by someone who is literally a hero in his eyes&quot;, as Rana was awed by the computer skills of Vidya. Gradually, the fascinated boy moves into a zone where he tries to protect her.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Ghosh acknowledges the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed &quot;running hot water&quot;. The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's <em><a href="Joy_Baba_Felunath" title="wikilink">Joy Baba Felunath</a></em> (1979).<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In an interview with <em>The Telegraph</em>, Ghosh says that the way Balan looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's <em><a href="Charulata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charulata</a></em> (1964), where the actress <a href="Madhabi_Mukherjee" title="wikilink">Madhabi Mukherjee</a> enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also acknowledges the influence of <em><a href="Mahanagar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahanagar</a></em> (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's <em><a href="Nayak_(1966_film)" title="wikilink">Nayak</a></em> (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's <em><a href="Aranyer_Dinratri" title="wikilink">Aranyer Dinratri</a></em> (1970) in which Ray &quot;wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car.&quot; Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become &quot;like Vidya's fellow passenger.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Besides Ray's films, Ghosh also admits inspiration from what he calls &quot;visually striking&quot; films of 1970s and 1980s, such as <em><a href="Deewaar_(1975_film)" title="wikilink">Deewaar</a></em> (1975).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Critics have compared the fake-pregnancy twist of <em>Kahaani</em> with the 2004 American psychological thriller <em><a href="Taking_Lives_(film)" title="wikilink">Taking Lives</a></em>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The sequences towards the end that explain the missing pieces of the mystery were compared with <em><a href="The_Usual_Suspects" title="wikilink">The Usual Suspects</a></em> (1995).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Ghosh writes that the film was heavily influenced by the colour scheme of the <em>Pratima Visarjan</em>, a c.1915 watercolour by the <a href="Bengal_School_of_Art" title="wikilink">Bengal School</a> artist <a href="Gaganendranath_Tagore" title="wikilink">Gaganendranath Tagore</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
